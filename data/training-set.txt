You're afraid of the responsibility ?
Guess what I just ate , Utahraptor !
That's actually really solid advice !
I don't , T - Rex !
I believe I will combine in a saucepan 2 cups of canned chickpeas , drained ; 1 tomato , chopped ; 4 whole cloves ; 2 - 3 cloves of garlic , minced ; and 1 1 / 2 cups coconut milk !
It's funny because it's far away !
And everyone only gets one vote , because we all agreed that it's fair if everyone gets a say even if the result is majority ( i . e . , MOB ? ? ) rule ! Plus we thought that , for god's sake , it was at least better than the alternative , which was doing whatever the rich and powerful tell us to .
On no , then people might not visit these sites ! !
Soon after she made an announcement .
The more the merrier !
I think if you cured cancer or something , we'd still know your name !
That's what he is ! That's why it is such a good joke ! Do you get it ?
A leader declares war on television , then that's war , regardless of whether he's signed the paperwork yet . He's changed the world just by talking ! With sentencing it's the same : the judge tells you your sentence and that's it , and the paperwork is just that - paperwork ! RECORDKEEPING . And the same for marriages ! The license is just to let the GOVERNMENT know what's already happened . I was right ! I was totally right ! !
Okay wait suddenly I see your point
No problem !
Yeah ! It's the idea that they're being watched on TV or by aliens or something . Not only does it make one feel important , but it's comforting to think that someone is there to share in your victories and defeats .
It's like you never grew up , and somehow everything around you still has this secret little life . Of COURSE my table is a woman ! That's what she identifies as whenever I'm not home and all my furniture comes alive .
We're supposed to believe we figured out how to capture and replay VIDEO before nailing down sound ? ?
Objection ! BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I KNOW WHO HE IS .
But couldn't we all be brains in jars or worse ?
I love weddings ! It's someone else's party and I can cry if I want to !
Whoever he is , I bet he's handsome !
We need to sex up our sayings to truly inspire a new generation ! !
That's a cultural stereotype T - Rex .
LATER , AT THE PARTY :
T - REX IN MY RELIGION YOU HAVE TO STOP COMPLAINING SO MUCH
PARTY . . .
So , T - Rex ! How did it go ?
JEALOUS ?
You're welcome ! Also , that rhymed .
This is " The Tragical History of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark " by William Shakespeare !
BACON - Delicious in a sandwich - Great at wound maggot removal - Still 0 grams of trans fat per serving -
It's just - - it's such a good word , I wish I had more chances to use it . Would you say you're FUBSY , Dromiceomimus ?
Starting right . . . NOW !
Yeah , except I asked God to make a rock he couldn't lift , and he did !
What's it like ?
I'm sick and ornery ! I just want to be left alone today , so give me my distance !
GOOGLE CHEAT SHEET
I suggest telling them that you're asexual !
Pretty sure I am , Utahraptor !
Miss Steve !
I seriously just can't stop blabbing about Dromiceiomimus's secret identity !
But - there is hope . Small changes compound into large ones , and soon you will be encountering situations that you don't recall .
Nooooo
OH MY GOD . This only serves to bring me closer to my ultimate fantasy of BECOMING a dog ! If only there were some handy mnemonic to remember this fact ? ?
Hey . Hey ! You have something stuck between your teeth !
What about when you don't know what the background looks like ?
But lots of the alternative names can be considered obscene , can't they ?
Which song ?
sorry horses
Aw MOM !
Okay , so -
I FEEL YOU , DRO .
Looks like you blew your chances with us , my friend !
He was asking me what the weight of xenon was and I was all " Duh , 131 . 3 AMU " and he was all " Duh , maybe for you , T - Rex " and I was all , " Aha ! Time to pontificate ! " Then I worked in an example about toast .
It's kinda the greatest unsolved problem in computer science !
How are you going to pull this off , T - Rex ?
Zombies ! Everyone loves zombies . They are a window onto the Other ! They let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling , as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic !
WE HAVE TO GO .
Try to kill me , and a parallel me survives ! I have achieved QUANTUM IMMORTALITY , with at least one version of my consciousness surviving indefinitely . And there's a non - zero chance that I'M the immortal me !
Oh man , what if people continued skateboarding INSIDE of the crashing helicopter ?
PROBLEMS THAT ARE EASILY SOLVED
Now on to the 10 Fs !
This story gets better soon , I promise !
Props on me for owning an electric car though .
Okay , well , have you tried spooky snacks ?
Um - I got you some . . . whole wheat flour ?
What ? Seriously ? ! That's amazing ! !
Frig ! I hadn't thought of that !
Um , MAKE BOOKS MORE AWESOME ? ?
Oh my gosh ! What ?
A man who can only see well when a light is turned on !
. . . the GOOD chest pains ?
The year is almost over , you guys ! We've hat 8 , 765 hours a year to GET THINGS DONE . I'm gonna say what we're all thinking :
This summer . . . slip into something More Comfortable .
RUMOURS
Every eight months or so I really want some fried chicken , the greasier the better . Then , I eat the fried chicken , and THEN , that itch is totally scratched ! But it never lasts , and my desire begins to grow again , culminating eight months later , when guys , I could SERIOUSLY go for some fried chicken .
T - REX DECIDES NOT TO KISS ANYONE FOR A MONTH TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE :
What the hell are you doing ? !
HOLY CRAP !
AMAZING ? ?

Actually - you know what ?
oh gosh , t - rex
Yes ! ! I agree !
What .
LIFESTYLE : Look at this celebrity you love eating our cereal ! They seem pretty put - together , right ? Their problems are better than your problems . They never cry in the shower .
My children's children would thank me !
There's no feedback at the end : no " B + try harder next time " , no " PURR - FECT WORK " sticker and then there's a picture of a cat !
HAHA NOPE
BECAUSE IF SO
This is true ! I guess they still have a stigma attached to them , though , you know ? The whole " comics are for emotionally stunted shutins " thing , which , WHILE TRUE , is misleading because comics are for everyone , INCLUDING emotionally stunted shutins ! People just need to focus on the positive .
it is likely that most people operating on the world stage have touched with romantic intent a butt not their own } }
Hey , YOU look like you're feeling a little disillusioned about film !
" Twinkle twinkle little star " !
Good ol' T - Rex , always thinking 'bout nothing !
But at least I've got some good dirt on the Utahraptor ! Who . . . is currently standing behind me , aren't you ?
Hello ! Someone ate my lunch right out of the fridge . IT WAS YOU , AND I FRIGGIN' KNOW IT .
YAAAAAAY
T - Rex , do you want to go visit the chocolate factory ?
Premarital sex !
" Green Lantern " ? !
Oh wow ! I think it's SO AWESOME that you'll spy on my dreams but you wont approve my friend request on Facebook Dot Com ! !
Okay , here's what I'm thinking : a dog bone that says " dogs " inside of it , or a dog bone that says " dogs " inside of it in Times New Roman , OR - and this one is my favourite - a dog bone that says " dogs " inside of it in an awesome 80s computer font .
YOUR BRAIN MIGHT NOT STOP FUNCTIONING IN A WAY WE CANNOT DIAGNOSE .
It's a paradox of our time
But one of your friends is like " Yo , I'll take that " , so they run like hell to catch it . But then they're like " Hold on , this is garbage , I don't want this either " and they toss it away too . And you're really excited - free garbage ! ! - so you run to catch it , only then you realize it's the same plastic you didn't want in the first place . Listen , I -
Well , they have to be mobile too !
Today is a good day I think to talk about HINDUISM .
Boo ?
I AM NOT RUDE ENOUGH TO LEAVE IN MID CONVERSATION BUT I AM JUST RUDE ENOUGH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
OH OKAY COOL
Everyone ! This T - Rex here has cooties !
no , it's NOT okay to contact this member about extra - marital affairs
No , Utahraptor , don't do it ! ! In The Future , you get old and DIE .
Yeah man , maybe all that survives from you is that quote !
UTAHRAPTOR I'M SORRY BUT I'M BUSTING YOU DOWN TO JOKE PRESCHOOL
Look , I appreciate the sentiment , but you've got to stop trying so hard . It's just got to happen , naturally , over time .
So you're altering your personality to suit - who ?
A pet is a good thing to get if you want something cute that is entirely dependent on you for its very survivOH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE
T - REX YOUR FRIENDS SURE ARE CRAZY EH
Originally this expression was " don't look any horse in the mouth " , as the inside of the average horse's mouth is a maddening , insanity - inducing nightmare of impossible angles and non - Euclidean geometry . With the invention of equine orthodontics , the expression was modified to " GIFT horse " , gift being an acronym for " Granting Insanity From Teeth " .
Wait , I can do better .
Today I made peace with the possibility that I might never get wrapped up in a madcap case of mistaken identity .
Here's one for you : how come dogs don't laugh ?
T - Rex , remember remember the 5th of November !
Perhaps !
Rex : Attention , parents ! THERE IS NO STOPPING THIS .
THE MOST LIKELY WAY HE DOES IT IS BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ATOMS IN HIS BODY .
Uh , BOOORRRIINNNGG
Dromiceiomimus , I am going to go on a trip around the world . Would you like to be my " travelling companion " ?
Like , he'd stare intently at your forehead and swipe it occasionally to turn the page !
EASILY AND FACTUALLY .
It just sounds like you're saying your name is " Hugga Bubba " .
Maybe !
No way ! I know all about sisterhood ! I know all about all sorts of things .
Please .
Why are you SO AFRAID of the truth coming out , T - Rex ?
WOOOOOO !
YOU LITERALLY DIE .
And I can't help it if you are a stupid dinosaur ! I wish I never met you !
Well , I was staring !
It'll give future historians something to talk about ! They will say , " Wow ! Who was this incredible man ? "
BUT CHECK IT ! BECAUSE OF THE EXPONENTIALLY SMALLER AMOUNT OF NEURONS IN HIS BRAIN , HE'S REALLY STUPID . MAYBE TOO STUPID TO LIVE . MAYBE NOT , CAUSE HE'S A SCIENTIST .
You give this guy enough radiation to kill a dinosaur , and it survives . Then you give it 500 times that dose , and it still shrugs it off ! Dudes are friggin' NIGH - INVINCIBLE against radiation . Just like , or so I suspect , myself !
Why , what cheek !
No ! No , it's just like - it's got books . And it's got calendars with puppies in teacups , framed by captions about commitment . You know ! Stuff the public wants !
Pre - Crisis Alfred worked as an intelligence agent , and interestingly enough the bullnose is the first step of a flight of stairs : it may be wider than other steps and rounded to support handrail end elements , called " volutes "
A question for us ! Do we missing having friends ?
Then . . .
Oni rabatencis min .
I'm a skeleton wrapped in meat that thinks it's alive ! !
Right ! " Imagine that ! "
Really ? Because it sounded like you were planning to STEAL THE PROTOTYPE KILOGRAM FROM ITS HOME NEAR PARIS , FRANCE .
Uncanny ! It's as if I'm seeing the world for the first time !
So I kind of shot my mouth off on an online forum ?
What ? No ! It's not sexist in here !
They both ended up with about fifty hits !
A deleted affair is when an old relationship is suddenly referred to in the story . Like when Utahraptor and I -

COMICS FOR ROOMMATES ( print and save ! )
You're - !
What have I done ?
Leonardo da Vinci ! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ! William Shakespeare ! These are all people we now consider to be GREAT . And get used to them , everyone , because we are the last generation where great people are possible !
This is once race you're going to lose , T - Rex !
The point at which a shrinking heap of sand becomes a non - heap . Clearly I'm supposed to struggle with an arbitrary threshold , because piles on either side of it look much the same . But it's just language ! Look at statistical usage of the word " heap " , decide using that average , end of story .
" James Watt's Son " . He uh , writes down what the dog does .
I'm uh , I'm still not really solid on what the elixir does .
That implies giving a depressed dude a few bucks will cheer him right up .
Casey and Riley were alone at last . " Finally , " breathed Riley into Casey's ear . " I've been wanting sex times all day . " They kissed . While kissing , Casey's arms wrapped around Riley , found a very enticing bottom , and gave it a squeeze .
I'll prove it ! This is me imagining what you look like , having seen you just seconds ago !
We could if we wanted . You know what's more interesting ? " Building " comes from " buldijana " in Proto - Germanic . That's a reconstructed language : we believe it existed , but don't have any concrete proof . As such , the entire language is built from logical deduction !
Huh ? God , my friends aren't crazy . Crazy's insane . My friends are WACKY .
And now I am concerned that if someone looks up my name online , they will see me acting like a jerk , and will conclude that I AM a jerk , and then they won't want to hire me or marry me or whatever . They - they won't want to do the thing that they were thinking of doing before they looked up my name .
Because of the second law of thermodynamics ?
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS EVER SAID THAT
REAL
You're making a list of - characters ?
Bananas is spelt , " b - a - n - a - n - a - s " .
CHECK AND MATE , HATERS
So there was this guy who loved frisbees ! He played frisbee all the time . He was big into frisbees , you guys .
" I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU "
T - REX AND DROMICEIOMIMUS SETTLE THEIR DISPUTE OVER ICE CREAM . LATER :
Today is a good day I think for replacing all my " oh crap " s , " oh dang " s and " oh snapadoodle " s with something infinitely more charming . From now on when I drop an anvil on my toe , this will be me :
Attention , sucky roommate ! !
TIME TO TELL PEOPLE SOME EMBARRASSING SECRETS T - REX
Oh , I'm just practicing . How was I ?
So , Utahraptor ! What do you think ?
COUNTERPOINT !
Oh Jennipoos you are so lovely
Okay , so , turns out I might be dead someday .
Holy smokes .
So these kids are picking up my stuff , but suddenly it's not my stuff , it's my friend's stuff , so I can't just give it away . And when I say " it's not for sale " , they're grabbing them tighter and saying , " Come on , I'm sure it is . " So I yell for my friends and when they show up the kids leave , but then they come back . . . WITH KNIVES .
Aaron ?
I can't . Nor do I want to !
Making a friend's world a better place AND showing them that you care ?
Because sometimes cowboys' parents got shot ?
And maybe UTAHRAPTOR will have some embarrassing stories !
Smallpox AND polio AND ebola AND plagues both black and bubonic , not to mention all sorts of colds that can become terminal . Also not to mention all the other sorts of plagues , ailments and diseases carried by POTENTIALLY EVERYONE I HAVE AND WILL EVER MEET .
I'm just saying , what if the real world is accessible only by drugs and what we CALL " reality " is the true insane illusion ? ?
Dromiceiomimus , I'm so manly that I crack open walnuts for old ladies with my pectoral muscles !
Today we settle the age - old question once and for all ! No longer will young and old alike go to bed in tears because they didn't know the answer to a simple question :
Hah ! I think I get it ! Listen , I'm gonna BASICALLY commit parts of this joke to memory .
BUT I ASSURE YOU
" A handsome T - Rex investigates , but his pratfalls only interfere with the ongoing police investigation . "
Too bad nobody saw it !
So are we going ?
Whatever , Dromiceiomimus ! You're fine . But look at MY thigh : it's somewhat larger than before
image is that ? Plus , you can't . . . such a restaurant . . . if you don't . . . cheap , it becomes All - You - Can - Politely - Eat , since you're trying to impress your date and thus you can't go all - out . Food should be a delight , not a symbolic stop at a gas station . I find
It's good exercise !

I am . I am !
I like people who have sexual fetishes that can't possibly be realized using existing technology .
It doesn't even say HOW he died . Was it old age ? Did he turn into a swarm of tinier Pans but then they all got eaten by birds ? ALL ARE EQUALLY POSSIBLE IN THE GREEK MYTHS .

Player One proposes a non - zero split , and Player Two can either accept or reject it !

ENTHUSIASTIC USE OF OUTDATED CATCH - PHRASES COMICS
Dead WRONG !
You both are crazy , and you both look fine !
I will not .
Riddles ! Everyone loves riddles , and I HAVE GOT A RIDDLE FOR YOU . Vin Diesel was walking down the street and found $ 50 . Instead of taking it , he went into town and stole a fish ! What the hell ?
You're just jealous !
I pay my landlord a monthly bribe to ensure the roof over my head doesn't disappear !
TIME MANAGEMENT , yo !
I GUESS that's true .
I'm Utahraptor , by the way . Pleased to meet you !
Everybody independently somehow comes to the conclusion that they'd rather be alone than hang out with you for even a second longer ! It's your greatest self - doubt given form . It's your worst social nightmare realized !
The best use of my time would be if I'm using every single moment to its fullest potential , right ? And we live in a universe wherein our past decisions affect what we get ( THANKS A LOT REALITY ) so even blowing a single moment fifteen years ago could make my present suboptimal .
Anyway man , who says you're in charge of when things become " old hat " ?
Hah hah ! Looks like it's Not Found ! !
And it's the same with christenings and sentences AND declarations of war : they all require paperwork ! I'D argue that the performative utterance is just part of the ceremony , and that the real change is made when you sign on the dotted line .
Who's everyone ?
It's true ! The only nurse costumes for sale are from Sexy Hospital , MD !
Oh man , is Tunisia working for Brussels ? Is the phone a remote detonator ?
The internet didn't help me at all ! It disctracted me with pictures of cats with opinions !
HAMLET :
- play this comes from !
Our bones are buried
I'm probably ALSO really good at surfing , stand up comedy , cross - stitching and helicopter theft ! I just haven't tried them because I prefer believing that I have secret talents the world hasn't seen to knowing for certain that I don't actually have anything special and secret in me waiting to be accessed .
What do you get ? !
PRETTY NEAT
We'd stop before that happened . More likely : the year gets a day longer , and we make it a holiday to celebrate ALL THE FRANKLY AWESOME SPACEFLIGHT WE'VE BEEN DOING .
I was wondering , what happens when you die ?
I DISAGREE ! !
So your secret is tap someone on the head and they'll blink ? You must be fun at parties .
Yes ! They'll say , " Objection ! Witness is causing a mistrial ! "
We can only wonder !
To clarify , I meant to imply that the King of the Dance was self - taught !
Dromiceiomimus , would you agree that life is a neoclassical pastiche ?
I've never been moved to tears by music !
I have discovered a new philosophy for life that appeals to my own sense of self - worth !
It says here that you and Agent U just surprise each other with stenographic images of swear words all day long .
Well for one thing , it's an extremely portable language . That means it works in all sorts of environments without many differences !

There are probably some is my working theory .

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof .

As he made his way down Everest , Angola was sad that he lost his target but glad that he got to learn more about mountaineering .
So what you're saying is , nobody cares about quicksand any more because it's no longer a threat to us because WE BEAT QUICKSAND ! !
So - - get to work ! Get to writing !
Utahraptor that is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE .
According to the Mayan calendar , the world will end in 2012 !

SANDWICHES DON'T HAVE MEANING THEY'RE JUST FUN THINGS TO CRAM INSIDE YOUR BODY VIA YOUR MOUTH
He or she isn't ! ! S / he is jsut a little passive - aggressive . He / she is just tired of picking socks out of the ceral or whatever .
Personally , I'm hoping for a little of both ? ?
Here's a question to ask myself :
But what if people call in with real problems ?
Dear Stranded On The Moon , that's an interesting problem you have there . It's almost as interesting as how a full grown T - Rex could forget Mother's Day !
I asked you to proofread a chapter , not to substitute your own retarded story !
What we need is a BETTER way to lose weight . And I'm no scientician , but I'm PRETTY SURE when you cry you're squirting matter out of your face . Matter which , I remind you , according to science MUST HAVE MASS AND THEREFORE WEIGHT HERE ON EARTH ? ?
And then one day doctors cure her disease and let her out of the room !
I would rate my relationships :
Um , thank - you ? Godzilla is pretty cool . The ladies must like Godzilla , although I didn't intend for -
It sucks , Dromiceiomimus ! People stop me in the street and say " I love your work " , and what do you say to that ? " I'm glad you found my stories arousing " ? Because that's - that's what I say .
I liked it on Breaking Bad where Breaking Bad would almost get caught by the police , but then not get caught by the police .
I'm not sure what you think kicking a kangaroo is
Someone didn't like what they were reading , so they defined its contents as " terrorism " . I think they were serious .
Shakespeare ! Can you teach me to write like you ?
Our first letter comes from Wendy , who writes : " Dear T - Rex , sometimes I worry I'm TOO happy in my many successful and mutually satisfying relationships . Any advice ? About me being almost TOO happy and satisfied , I mean ? "
YES , THEY ARE NOT WHAT I PROMISED YOU
This is the universe where we always rhyme !
I'm sorry , are you saying when you invent punctuation you DON'T want to make it as badass as possible ?
I'm someone from the past !
You live in a bland world of consumer electronics , Utahraptor . I live in a world of robot pals who bake me food !
And if a civilization can do this once , it's likely that they'd EVENTUALLY do it more than once . They could even reach a point where simulations are mass produced : billions of disposable toy realities used for experiments , research , or given to children during Future Christmas !
It's just that - it can be hard to have a meaningful conversation when you're dancing around all these clich ? s .
GRAPEFRUITS : TOTALLY AWESOME
I like the feeling of looking in on an alternate universe : that sense of familiarity , altered but recognizable . But even without it , some are just really great songs that stand on their own !
Yes I just swore ! I said -
Also because we're too dumb . It'd be like a dog trying to predict what its owner does .
Okay , yeah , sign me UP brotimes ! !
This situation with the Dromiceiomimus has raised some interesting romantic questions .
That one's accurate !
There , within the burning wreckage of civilization , stands a battered fairy !
AWKWARD MOMENT FEATURING NIRVANA'S " HEART - SHAPED BOX " MASHED UP WITH " CALL ME MAYBE "
No , that would be good , but that's not my story . My story is a simple love tale about simple people , with names that are legally and creatively distinct .
You sure did ! Dromiceiomimus and I are going ! You should come because the kangaroo is going to solve all his problems with his fists , and when he's done , his problems are gonna be solved RIGHT IN THE FACE .
OBVIOUSLY we all know I need to work on my analogies
If you write a really dramatic scene , your heart rate goes up !
You're treating this like a video game ?
Attention , everyone ! Nicknames without consent are invalid ! !
So the universe is deterministic , running without outside management - like a clock ! God invents the laws of physics , sets everything in motion and then relaxes as the clock runs forever . Maybe he brushes his hands off and says " I'm goin' on infinite break " .
Aren't there other things in life we could be having instead of babies ? Like , what if every time you wanted a baby , instead you went out and had a nice meal with cool people instead ? Mmmm ! That sounds like a real tasty time , you guys !
UTAHRAPTOR , I HAVE QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS
MAN ! I don't want to be the only dude with an embarrassing past . You must have something !
When Midas found out everyone knew , he died of embarrassment .
They unsettle us all , I know .
Quite possibly !
I've seen you look intrigued before , T - Rex , I'm sure of it !
And you're about to say that there ARE no objective criteria for art , but you're forgetting that's a baby answer you give to babies . If art can be objectively bad , it can be objectively good . Are you prepared to say art can't be bad ?
It was an exciting time to be saying " Forsooth " !
Why ? What do you say ?
Sure is ! !
But wouldn't it get a little repetitive ?
TIME TO GET INSPIRED for real
Well it won't work ! It takes more than shouting " spring break " and " woo " to make a party happen !
Did you get anything ?
I fell down stairs and I am none the worse for wear !
Today is the day , my friends ! Yes ! FINALLY . Today is the day !
OFT - QUOTED YOU MEAN
I know ! But look , I've found a way to say this without sounding shallow : I'd like both to have good friends AND be famous AND be extremely popular with everyone !
" Here lies T - Rex ! SURROUNDED BY HIS VICTIMS . "
Also , the humans get jetpacks .
WHY ARE WE TALKING LIKE THIS T - REX
One time I got a little lost while driving in a new town .
UM , I RECOMMEND YOU STAY OUT OF MY WAY ? ?
Today , I am selling compliments !
PHRASES THAT MEAN NOTHING COMICS
* POSTSCRIPT *
Cultural universals , like linguistic universals , are properties that are found in EVERY SINGLE CULTURE EVER !
Well , that should throw her off the trail !
You jerk ! You brought a list !
If you want to write a good parody OR talk about what makes a good parody , absolutely ! Therefore , I propose " alternate - timeline metarhyme " .
PROBLEM 3 : ATE TOO MANY CRACKERS
TO SPITE YOU .
Excellent ! Then we're ALL down with fall .
DINOSAUR ! !
DO YOU MEAN EVERYONE WILL DIE BECAUSE IF SO DOES THAT INCLIDE LIKE COCKROACHES
My photo album , I guess ?
Everybody needs to fall in love ! To fall in love is to value another person's happiness above your own to want to be with them and make your lives together the bet they could possibly be . Are you saying you would not like to love and be loved ? Of course you would . Your partner is out there looking for you . You should probably get on this .
" Why hello there , Utahraptor , great to see you ! I meant to mention : I borrowed your shovel . I meant to mention it before but you weren't around and I was certain you wouldn't mind ! I just completely forgot to return it . "
Stood up on ST . PATRICK'S DAY ? !
Man , that's reverse sexism !
You don't seem to be that big into these cat facts , my friend !
Because I actually wanted to talk about cool sex stuff instead !
You have to pick up your dog's poop either way , so you might as well pretend he's a millionaire while you do it . " Good poops , Sir , " you can say . " Here have a treat . You , Sir , are a good dog . "
I got it , yeah !
But it's not too late !
Hah hah , not me though ! !
He " wigged out " ?
Whoah , so instead of attacking the position , we attack the person ?
HOW TO STOP GETTING SO MANY EMAILS
To be free we must give ourselves up to being totally protean and chameleonic !
We regret to inform you that an issue has been discovered with your body .
Oh - kay !
WHy does everyone keep saying these obviously false things ? What , is it Stockholm Syndrome ?
MEANWHILE , IN A PARALLEL " FRENCH RAP " UNIVERSE :
So ! How's it going , Dromiceiomimus ?
THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF SCIENCE
Columbus popularizes the continent !
Tired of eating 'em boiled ? Bake em !
There were a couple of rebellions in the Canadas , a fire in the Winter Palace and an earthquake in Galilee !
Yes ! Lots of holes there !
It's because the phase coils are 1 . 3 % out of alignment and this has an outsized effect on the output of the matter / antimatter reaction chamber .
The futility of life ?
Cirkumsexual :
Yep ! Lots of animals can't detect beats either . . . including DOGS .
It is so bad , T - Rex ! Fascism is bad news ! !
I AM QUITE BAD AT THIS
HMM . . .
I've got a mystery I'd like solved !
Incidentally , my body is REMARKABLY well preserved , I gotta say .
A TRUE STORY
The Devil ! He won't leave me alone , and all he's doing is bragging about the video game consoles he owns .
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER
hah hah hah
Ok - just give me a second to think of something !
didn't anyone TELL ME
UNLESS YOU'RE SUGGESTING SUPERMAN DIDN'T THINK OF THAT BECAUSE THE COMICS ARE WRITTEN AND ILLUSTRATED BY NON - SUPERMAN ENTITIES , IN WHICH CASE I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU , UTAHRAPTOR :
Wow ! I guess we need to know how much our planet is worth , then . I'm guessing . . . a kabazillion dollars ?
In Conclusion , some animals are poison !
Antonio Tony and Amelia , my erotic fiction characters , go to sleep after having some erotic fiction ! While they sleep , Antonio dreams he's chatting Amelia up ! Sheesh ! Give her a rest , Antonio !
As I said before , I believe you may have a hairline fracture .
And don't let your characters " stand " on the panel border ! CLASSIC beginner mistake .
I can see fraud being a problem , though , especially since if the fraud's successful , the government loses real money .
SIR WAS BORN FOR THIS , YO
IT IS CLEAR THAT I DO NOT IN FACT HAVE COOTIES !
Oh , no .
Me say dayyy o !
Those are all plagiarized song lyrics ! Except for " but " , but there's probably a song called " But " .
Except for the kids who are born male .
No , home - made presents are good too .
Sure , but it's weird to imagine us married and acting exactly the same as we do now . I only see you once a day and then I'm off to talk to someone else - what does that say about our marriage ? ?
Only later , in the evening , do you realize that you've spent another day stuck in your self - imposed rut ! Another day , down the drain !
And the Prince is kidnapped by " Bowsella " ?
My relationships are fine too ! I broke up with the guy I was dating , but it's cool .
Captain Liberty , give it a rest .
Sure ! I mean , it's okay !
Yeah ! Because I wouldn't really want to be friends with a crazy racist either , but isn't that sort of just fighting intolerance with intolerance ? The person was still your friend for years and years , so they're probably a good person , all the crazy racism aside .
But not always ?
Whoah
And it really works ? It gives you the strength of twenty men ?
That's not meeeeeee
Hah ! Wow !
Dude wrote a song called " Lick Me In The Arse " and wrote " shit in your bed and make it burst [ for me ] " to his COUSIN .
What ? ! " The End " !
DINOSAUR COMICS PRESENTS : " DEGREES OF INFORMATION "
That way , rather than relying on friction and stuff to manage the position of the skateboarder , I can just tilt the incline up or down in order to keep them in the right position . Then , hey presto , it works and physics is happy ! FOR ONCE .
Wow , that's pr -
Mind describing this " loophole " , T - Rex ?
" Ice " to see you again , Antarctica ! !
Entertaining and affecting and surreal . Man ! Can you imagine waking up one day and finding that all the radio stations have been replaced by a little girl's voice reading out endless strings of numbers ? It would be GREAT .
Buddhism allows me to forgo material things .
I am Rose , your fated lover ! Let us enjoy ourselves in this consequence - free environment !
It's decided !
Aw MAN !
So let's find out !
So don't listen to commercial radio , dude !
Okay , time to get myself into some of them books of quotations !
Okay dudes and lesbians ! Getting a woman to like you is easy !
Dear audio diary ! Today I learnt when someone promises a tour of a land of whimsy , that REALLY just means they want you to buy them breakfast . Period underscore period , diary !
Fine , I'm moving away , deleting everything AND legally changing my name . Bye , it's impossible to find me now ! !
It SUCKED !
They , um - they sure could be faster , is what I'm sayin' .
I too represent nature , but rather its nurturing aspect !
Then they'll immortalize ME and I get to do the easy job : SMOOCHIN' BABES ! !
Wow , I'm mega jealous of teens right now ! !
SUPER GREAT ? ?
AMAZINGLY , T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR SOLVE ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES OF GENDER . . . BETWEEN PANELS !
Huh ? Wait , does my story destabilize the space - time continuum or what ?
Lessons in Sharing : Featuring T - Rex
Not these ones ! They're inherently flawed , assuming you ever want to hear from someone you don't already know . If two strangers have a whitelist system , then either they can never talk to each other , or they still get spam !
A - Are you ?
I had the coolest dream last night . BATMAN was in it ! And ZOMBIES !
MEPHITIC OCULAR RYOMA .
And it works ?
zero zero zero
Ahh , another relaxing day for me , T - Rex , the king of the dinosaurs and the dinosaur of kings .
Are H . A . T . s mandatory ? I like showing off my headmeats .
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S INTERESTING
It doesn't look like you've read her letter , just memorized it .
A cave dude plus education = a modern dude ! Or dudette ! Assuming people still say " dudette " !
But that's more a definition of happiness than a guide to achieving it , T - Rex !
" Shucks but I wish we'd invented bathrooms ! " they'd say !
Don't look at me like that , Utahraptor ! If my life's work is only used by some guy decades down the line to crack wise about poopin' , I'll count myself as one lucky dude with one awesome legacy .
LATER , T - REX HAS COMPLETED HIS PRENUP ! WHAT'S IT SAY , T - REX ?
Well , I don't want this to be a " thing " , Dromiceiomimus , but it's called " mummy brown " and it's KINDA made from ground - up mummies .
If that were true , then the FUTURE ITSELF becomes a friggin' popularity contest ! !
No , I mean , how does a tugboat end up in orbit ? Your readers will want to know this ! How does he move ? Are his compartments pressurized ?
Then I am going to be requesting a refund for that correspondence course !
Many poisons don't taste like anything , so hey ! Keep that in mind when eating !
I will go for a walk and talk about the weather .
Yep , I got a problem .
Oh wow ! That IS a possibility !
So the Rajasaurus down the street and I went out for dinner last night . It was great !
It's okay ! We'll be your friends even without presents .
Probably , dude
Sure ! He's given powers through an alien ring , so really you just need a slightly modified Drake Equation that incorporates the odds of strangers giving you stuff .
During the previous diurnal cycle , I counted myself among the ranks of the lonely ! Now you're lying in quite close proximity .
Gravity yanked him to the center of the Earth , gruesomely killing him ! !
THE END ?
I was inspired when I saw a racist person stripping !
Well , making positive life changes is hard !
Fine , so she's bad at computers . WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS .
I was just thinking how , if I were to leave , that would change many things .
T - REX I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'M GOD WHATEVER I SAY CARRIES AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING IN PASSING AND NOT HAVE IT BE A BIG DEAL
. . . OH MY GOSH . UTAHRAPTOR .
My grandfather died a few months ago and I was given this part of his estate . He found it after the war , in the rafters of a house he bought !
How much more ? TWO tubes ? THREE ?
Are you sure it wasn't just a confidence thing ? A sort of " the new dance moves were in you all along " thing ?
It only takes forever because you're writing it in base 10 . Have you even TRIED writing out pi in base pi ? It's super easy . You know what pi is in base pi ? It's 10 . Ask me what pi is in base pi , Dromiceiomimus .
I just tried imagining what the future will be like , but what I saw was a world destroyed ! And . . . I seemed excited about it !
Oh well ! AT LEAST WE GET CLOUDING MINDS , BRITTLE BONES , AND FAILING ORGANS IN EXCHANGE ? ?
LATER , T - REX TRIES IT AND COMMITS SOME CUSSES TO WRITING !
Oh man , those ad trucks piss ME off too !
SECRETLY
How come everyone keeps trying to email this card to themselves eight hours in the past
So when are you going to get married , T - Rex ?
Me neither ! Why are we looking ?
One of those was a wig .
WHEN
Why don't we have robot cars that drive us around yet ?
Oh , gosh , so many ! She's great at science , makeouts , hijinks , heists . . . the works ! You know , all the basics they teach you in Perfect Woman Finishing School .
Utahraptor ! It says here that it's you ! It says right here on " BURN CHART 2007 " that you're # 1 !
How did these people get to be so awesome ? Did they start when they were young ? When I was a kid , I just wanted to watch cartoons , but I really want to be amazing now . I want people to say , " That T - Rex , you've got to know him ! He's an amazing guy . So interesting too ! "
Wait , what ?
As high as he could !
The REAL nightmare was how poorly my subconscious understands zombies !
Um , the best one of them all ? ? ?
What's the point of getting away from EVERYONE if you bring someone with you ?
TRUE . Plus I too say " y'all " when the situation demands it of me . Okay , I'm racist against people who . . . wear running shoes to the opera ?
. . . Um , probably ? ?
It's my blessing and my curse !
Maybe he was lying !
Plus , the dead wouldn't decompose but instead recombine into large , better organized megacorpses !
HELL YES
Antonio took notes on some of the ghosts , dragging their mangled , legless bodies through malls , parks , and stadiums . He knew any book he produced would be invaluable to historians , but also knew anything he produced would be seen as fiction .
Okay Dromiceiomimus , which do you like better ? " Assuming God exists , he might want that acknowledged on a weekly basis ! " , or " Religion ! Well , It's Been Around For A While " ?
Right . Because the guy who , out of the full spectrum of things that grow out of faces , chooses to cultivate ALWAYS - ON HITLER COSPLAY is the aggrieved party here .
Please hand me the customs declaration form .
HUH .
Fares are not guaranteed until paid in full and tickets issued .
Hi , Dromiceiomimus . . . sun's sure hot today , eh ?
THAT SAID :
Hmm . . . like everyone , I do like a good slow jam .
Who here likes waiting ? Raise your hand .
I thought dramatic displays were preferable to genuine feelings ; I believed stalkery behaviour was cool when it's from the person you're destined to be with . I - I woke up this morning with the regrets .
It was an oppertunity for me to showcase my sparkling wit !
A little .
What if I made . . . carbonated CARBON ?
i can't get enough !
Is there some political undertone to what you're saying ? !
. . . Especially if they're bored ?
Have we all learnt about sonnets yet ?
In Slovak they end with " . . . and they lived happily , until they died " !
THAT'S GOOD TOO
What'd we do to these chumps ? ?
Um , not anymore ! !
HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION WITH YOUR PARENTS ABOUT YOUR LIFE
AWWW , I love pals
rrrring rrrrrring
Yes , I though we did a good job ! I was kinda surprised though that you had so little going on , God , that you could supply partial backup vocals for my song .
ACTUALLY I THINK THERE'S A DUDE LIKE THAT JUST DOWN THE STREET
Also this future - land everybody would live in igloos and fight bears .
I'm worried that my Dinosaur Present Day , Featuring T - Rex , has become too commercial ! We've forgotten about the true spirit of the day .
There ` s tons of great chat apps available for your e - reader , phone , tablet or phablet ! Be sure to use one with " chatbots " : the latest artificial intelligences designed fool to you into thinking they're a real person ! These " chatbots " will talk to you about anything you want for as long as you'd like . Who needs friends anyway ? ?
I ALSO ENCODED IT INTO THE DNA OF SEVERAL NEW SPECIES
Speaking of e - readers , be sure to load them up with lots of free ebooks !
What's with you , mister ? ! All you hadda do was hold him just for a minute !
Yes . Who doesn't ?
God damn you , Evil T - Rex !
All we have to do is re - run the temporal experiment BACKWARDS , thereby forcing time back into its usual lattice inversion structure !
SEXT : ur playing mario 3 , i ask what u like best , tanooki or hammer bros suit ? ? ? u say u like fire mario best and i leave and i never call u
Many such products even imitate the grain of a dead animal's flesh !
All I need is a treadmill that tilts !
T - REX TRIES IT
How perfectly reasonable
Can't improve on that just by closing your eyes !
That's exactly how I feel ! You've articulated it perfectly .
T - REX I WAS RECENTLY SPECULATING ON THE PROMISE OF AR AND WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD REMARK ON THIS MATTER
But you can't catch an inherited disease . You're just egging on hypochondriacs !
We ALREADY AGREED dreams sounds hella symbolic when described . If we want to talk about their contents , we have to move past symbolism !
Man , I have got to have like the loosest grasp on Christianity EVER
There are like a decazillion of them I am ALMOST certain
I regret never going white - water rafting !
T - Rex , the " here to say / somethingest guy in the USA " combination is older than dust , and adding " rappingest " is like pouring extra dust from an old folk's home over it . A Pangean old folk's home .
FACTUAL ISSUES .
But if you don't have A FULL DECADE OF YOUR LIFE TO BURN ON A PhD , HAH HAH HAH , you can always choose a smaller topic ! For example , instead of studying " 20th century English literature " , you could instead study " watching fun cartoons " .
" ANOTHER WACKY ADVENTURE "
And then . . . work at that job or at better jobs as they come along , until I get married and later on die ! THE END .
( It's French ! )
Did ANYONE ?
Okay , so what if they come back with " too low , you suck ! " ?
Only this spy didn't realize that I'M really good at fighting in dreams , so I pinned him to the roof with one hand and called 911 , and the dispatcher was like " we only respond to EMERGENCIES , T - Rex - and you've got this handled ! " I thanked them politely and hung up and said " Did you hear that ? I think they're only gonna come if YOU call . " Then I crushed the phone with my other hand and said " Wow . You're having a really difficult day . "
It's SO GOOD . " Albert Einstein described the relationship between energy and matter . He died anyway ! " " Genghis Khan has a lot of sex and wars . He died anyway ! "
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT T - REX
NEGOTIATION MAN ! !
You heard me ! !
You may be right ! However : I still think my wit is stellar !
Before you go any further , let me clarify that I'll be a hairdresser for MAMMALS . These guys have ALL SORTS of hair coming out of ALL SORTS of places . I'll trim it and they'll say " Wow , this hair cut has made me a WAY better looking mammal ! Thanks for trimming the hair off my head , sweat glands and mammaries ! "
Well MAYBE he wrote in his diary that he did agree , and I've read his diary !
Nope ! I gotta set all this stuff up ! But thanks !
I'm not ! I'm not ! ! I'm CERTAINLY not writing erotica in my head right now .
I don't know ! I can't look up mice on the internet because my internet is down !
The question the Devil just asked me about " orphaned games ! "
The Huxtables were a family on a TV show . TV is what we had before we got video in our brains ! And everyone who read this comic when it first came out was really great , even if we're all dead now .
. . . of the sexual histories of friends and acquaintances , PERHAPS ? ?
What I'm going to do is get a construction crew to put a skeleton , wearing workman's clothes , RIGHT IN MY HOUSE'S WALLS . Then , when my house is torn down in the future , the deconstruction crew will wonder which of their unlucky cousins faced such a grim demise !
I think that marriage is a very personal thing , T - rex !
Then we're SET !
Earlier :
What's your alternative , a government keeps track of all your money and does your taxes for you ?
This sounds expensive .
Or , should I say . . .
What just happened
* GAAASP *
OMG , Petey !
I'd like to subscribe , please !
I was 10 the last I painted ! And it was muscley dog doing the splits . And I'm sure Leonardo could have painted it better . And I'm pretty sure I'm talking about the Ninja Turtle there .
I drank too much
U r rite !
Oh , Mr . Tusks ! I should call the police . You're so cute it's illegal !
If somehow - SOMEHOW - I die , then I would like to be cremated , please !
Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others !
I say again ! !
Here's the 411 : we don't need words to speak anymore ! We can use NUMBERS !
I'M ALREADY ON IT , JERKS !
I will stop sleeping right away ! Tonight !
That's not me !
Pardon ?
I know where you could find a beach ball !
EATING RULES
I've lost my voice !
This is why I always discount stories that " happened to a friend " , or " happened to a guy I know " - you can probably be pretty sure that SOMETHING happened to some dude SOMETIME , but not much beyond that !
Sure , but I don't like them because they're SPECIAL . I like them because they're awesome !
Man , I love efficient success ! I'm all about efficient success ! You know how I take baths ? EFFICIENTLY .
Are you jealous of my mutant dinosaur powers ?
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT , A COIN FLIP HAS LANDED NOT HEAD OR TAILS , BUT PERFECTLY BALANCED ON ITS SIDE . HOWEVER , NOBODY HERE SAY IT HAPPEN :
Okay , true , but it's NEAR their house , right ?
Something to look forward to !
Hey , couple making out across the street ! She just jennifed you , dude ! !
YEP , TURNS OUT I COULD IN FACT DO THAT IF I TRIED
AAAAAAHHHHH ! !
Huh . You know what ? I really value our friendship .
I was sort of expecting that you'd point out flaws of my home business , but sure , I'd be glad to sell you one !
This is you !
Hi T - Rex ! What's up ?
That's so lame !
You literally die ?
Hold your foul tongue and your rotten Broadway loafer's lingo !
What ? What and outrageous illustration ! !
But . . . it DOES sound rad
I am ! And you , Utahraptor , are quite affable at times !
Yes ! You're right , this IS my chance ! I forgot about it untill now !
SWEET . I'll come in wearing a moustache after you guys leave , but I'll just buy some milk ! That way , the guy at the cash'll be expecting me to hilariously buy some pornos , but no , I'll just buy the milk . Maybe some cheese .
Midas still claimed Pan won , so Apollo cursed him with ass's ears !
And he's breathe quickly .
It's Nanite versus Manite ! Two titans battling for dominance of my affections !
not actually that bad !
I am not a dude who loves big companies .
BASICALLY , any place you'd use a comma , write " and " and / or " but " and / or " anyway whatever " instead . For example , " It was the best of times but anyway whatever it was the worst of times . " Isn't that better ?
I HONESTLY THINK YOU SHOULD STOP CONSUMING YOUR OWN FAECAL OUTPUT
It's brilliant , Utahraptor . Mouths as buffers for our backup bladders , or " stomachs " , pressed into service during crises ! Bodies are amazing . They're amazing !
So you want leprosy .
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts ! Facts are equal to the work performed by these facts , divided by time .
Not really ! Laser thigh surgery's a dumb idea .
And if it isnt Ms . " Syzygy " herself !
'Sup T - Rex !
Oh crap ! Everybody died !
Maybe you really ARE the last one alive , but in response to the stress you went INSANE , imagining we're all still here !
Yes , today truly has been a day of frustrated expectations !
Or maybe you have to wait longer for a book to turn a profit !
Stupid log cabin in my way ! Prepare to be returned to the ground ! Entropy is always increasing !
Seeing someone go through a video game as fast as they can . The Devil tells me these are called " speed runs " .
Where ?
" That woman was nice / Actually , super nice / If we're gonne be that precise . " I'D freestyle with that one , Dromiceiomimus !
SHOCK ENDING :
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -
" Thrust " ?
I was telling you about a woman I dated ! She was fun alone but clammed up in public . The frog was an allegory ! A Chuck Jones allegory !
Once upon a time there was a man who bragged to a king that his daughter could spin straw into gold . This absurd claim was entirely without merit .
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MALE GAZE
Aw dang , no !
Utahraptor , I'm revoking your " able to say words " license for the day !
Thanks for the - unsolicited naming advice for children I don't have ?
Ah , the fallacy of balance . You talked about THAT six years , eight days ago today .
. . . DVDs of old TV shows mostly , plus , PLUS , I bought lots of slightly irregular chocolate in bulk
I have received complaints . Apparently I can be difficult to follow , and sometimes people get confused .
" Hey everyone , look at me ! I'm T - Rex ! My truth is the right truth ! "
Look , I know you want to take their side , Utahraptor , but there's no way those guys were - what , baking me a cake and suddenly ran short of flour ? They're planning something .
What's the deal with THAT ?
Well , I guess the difference is that nobody will ever get mad at you for being intolerant of racism ! Except for racists .
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS HOW HE BOSSES ANTS AROUND !
BUT TWO MONTHS LATER , THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED . . .
He always seemed so enthusiastic !
I am faith , trust , and hope ! I am the profound belief in a power larger and more important than ourselves .
T - REX IT'S TIME TO SET YOU STRAIGHT ABOUT HOW GENDERED NOUNS ARE GOOD
Dromiceiomimus , I'm awesome ! If I wake up one morning and think " What have I ever done with my life , have I ever really accomplished anything , OH GOD " , then that thought will be followed by " Wait I forgot how awesome I am ! NEVERMIND . "
Because they TOTALLY should !
And yet , as all motorists know , using a bright light in fog actually reduces visibility . What's going on here ?
Not the least of which was the fact that suddenly changing this universal constant irrevocably altered both physics AND chemistry . No elements more complex than hydrogen could form . People's heads fell apart and / or exploded . Life across the entire universe ended in seconds .
It's way too late for that !
That's like , a two - day loaner from the library , TOPS .
But it's unfair !
FRIIIIIIII -
HOUR 34 :
Friends ? !
I had this dream where I was playing basketball with Bill Cosby .
Oh my god being a physical being is such total baloney !
Nope . He'd have to earn it ! We'd do sports or something to see .
b ) To people we do not usually identify with , and . . .
But the POINT is that if you give a raccoon a sugar cube , it'll wash it , and then the sugar will dissolve ! HILARIOUS !
What , by stomping on people ?
The lyrics are always so terrible and the songs entirely arbitrary . It's like - it's like they license " Candle in the Wind " and then have some Elton John sound - alike singing " Goodbye , Norma Jeane / Did you ever / Use Duracell / They make some fine batteries / On this we all should dwell "
I jsut wouldn't like it if they showed up in my living room in their cab , that's all .
Oh wait , sorry , that whole " eat their weight in nectar " thing isn't actually true . They actually have to eat FIVE TIMES their weight in nectar every day or they die . That , my friends , is BAD to the ASS to the DEFINITELY TRUE .
Wait ! I'm a genius !
Sword - point , yeah .
You should do it ! Maybe even guys would kiss him , because the sign told them too !
Three times .
( You kiss in my story ! )
Cooooooooool
Teens ! Are you interested in slang ?
Has any religious scholar asked this question before ?
Well . . . MAYBE .
I think it's romantic !
What's this I hear about tea with a certain Dromiceiomimian friend of ours ? !
Dromiceiomimus invited me to a party like two months in advance ! But - more weird was that I was actually musing about not wanting to be prematurely invited to any parties just before she spoke to me . It's incredible .
NOW IT'S VAMPIRE DAY !
No way ! I am doing them a FAVOUR .
he's a real catch and um , you should get married
I am generally a pretty easy - going guy ! But guys , there's this one thing really boils my potatoes !
Yep , watch this .
SEXUAL ambiguity !
What kind of pie do ghosts like ?
You realize that now you're living for revenge ?
It's too late , T - Rex ! We're going to have sex with men RIGHT NOW ! !
What do you like best about visiting old friends , T - Rex ?
What are you talking about ? You don't have a job in the first place !
Because I have to put my foot down !
You DARE ?
Holmes directed the robot to the city , then went inside to nap !
You just take an existing country and add universal two for one tacos !
Or for an industrial drill bit . Whatever ; THE POINT IS , whenever you look at it you can thing , " My pal's body made that . Huh ! I remember him now ! "
Reverse lightbulb jokes !
BASICALLY ANYTHING
These STDs are bacteria , and if baby gets 'em in the eye , bad things can happen ! It's just a precaution . Mom can carry them and be asymptomatic , so better safe than sorry !
Sometimes I wonder where you get your facts from . Discredited children's books ? That's my current theory .
A'doy ! !
It's a great premise ! I might use it as the basis of a book series . And if this turns out to be a bad idea years down the line , I'll just go back and decide not to do this after all ! Hah hah hah ! I LOVE REALITY
THE TWO GUYS WHO KEPT TAKING BITES & # 8230 ; OUT OF CRIME !
PEOPLE WHO QUOTE OTHER PEOPLE ALL THE TIME COMICS
Option one : stop using internet . Option TWO : use more internet to get your baseline tolerance up . with repeated , consistent use , you should be able to sustain up to 18 hours of internet a day !
Man , you weren't even doing it right ! !
I'VE GOT LOTS OF THOSE !
TALKING DINOSAURS IN : " THE FALLACY OF BALANCE "
Any series of 1s and 0s can be converted ( quite easily ) into a regular number ! So , for instance , your favorite song is contained - quite literally - in one single , 4 million digit number .
I was disappointed that Dromiceiomimus didn't get me anything from her trip , and that feeling had been lingering . OKAY . But , instead of IGNORING my feelings like i always do , BURYING them , GIVING THEM A CLASSY FUNERAL , I talked to her and now she probably thinks I'm crazy ! ARGH !
We've moved on to awesome deflation , my friend !
So all foods should be pureed and mixed into flavoured ice .
But maybe I'm not at the party BECAUSE of my shufflepants !
" Criminals can be so cruel , " said one Batman .
How are you going to convince people to use it ?
What God's saying !
I suppose I'd talk to both of the people to see what they'd have me do .
So . . . start a company ?
Your poetry sounds a little political , T - Rex !
Okay , sure !
" Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there , plagiarizing , fearing " ?
I'M KINDA GOD THOUGH
* squish *
It's so rad that we uploaded our brains into self - repairing computers powered by the universe herself , thereby finally freeing ourselves from the shackles of mortality !
What ? I do not ! !
Credit card fraud is a growing problem in today's society !
I know that getting a transplant is serious business , and that it can be a traumatic event .
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Let's settle this question once and for all !
In the high - stakes world of kissing , there's just no room for second chances . Luckily for anyone , I can teach you how to kiss ! You simply whisper " The inside of your mouth looks a little dry " , lock mouths with your partner , and then , you flood them with your saliva .
T - REX WHAT'S GOING ON MAN THINGS ARE PRETTY GREAT EH
I mean , the RHETORICAL " you " can .
Probably ! !
Hey man ! This tan is 100 % totally real ! I've been working out . . . AT THE BEACH .
Imagine my dismay at coming to such a realization !
Petey do you want to commit to someone without fear , share yourself without shame , find in yourself the amazing beautiful person you'd always hoped you'd become as she finds it in herself too ?
Kat : quite quickly !
. . . You're not on Twitter right now , T - Rex . On that subject : I followed you on Twitter for about 10 minutes , but everything you posted was . . . insane ?
I think you're exhausted and can't recognize it .
So you like drinking blood , huh ? Interesting , interesting . Well , let me ask you this : do you like drinking blood . . . FRESH FROM AN ALIVE BODY ? ?
T - Rex I am also a vice mayor
Act Like A Dromiceiomimus Day ? I have not heard of this holiday !
Eve !
So it's in our shared interest not to overcow the field .
If you can do anything , then you can do things that prevent yourself from doing other things , and therefore , you can't do anything .
There's one way to find out !
Proof : robots are clearly significantly cooler than talking horses !
Characters in video games are crazy .
YOU
Congratulations ! You've passed your Salt - n - Pepa test and have earned your degree in Applied Shoop . Can we email it to you , or is a physical degree necessary ?
Okay okay : try naming your baby after their species ! That worked out real well for me AND my closest friends .
Sherlock shrugged . Deducing how he ended up here would be a long story !
IT ALL WORKS
How exactly am I supposed to lose my ego and become enlightened through meditation ? SAYING " PRACTICE " DOESN'T COUNT . What I want is unambiguous , non metaphorical step - by - step instructions ! Buddha is supposed to be a dude who took steps to move from unenlightened to enlightened , right ? Is there any reason why the steps he took are not understandable , communicable , repeatable and verifiable ?
Worse than that . He was just so smug about everything ! I wanted to buy some RAM , so that my computer could think harder about things ? But he had this air of - distain , I guess , that went far beyond " aloof store clerk " to " terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive . " I bought the RAM but now I can barely even enjoy it .
HEY T - REX CAN YOU SUMMARIZE THAT IN ONE SENTENCE FOR ME
ALTERNATIVE RENDERINGS GUEST COMICS ! ! ! by Dave Cheung
" You can't fire me , baby ! I quit ! "
News Flash : Reality is super - awesome !
. . . those family members get BUTCHERED .
Yes , I'm certain of it !
What if people can't tell when I'm being sarcastic ?
Who'd be interested ?
LinkedIn will now contact them !
MAN DOES NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE T - REX
Sure I did ! We smoke together sometimes !
. . . Oh my god you're right . Oh my god . You're totally right .
For comparison , New York City is the entire population of 4000 BC all hanging out together . Last year , apple talked everyone from 4000 BC into buying at LEAST one iPad each . Twenty - four 4000 BC earths log onto Facebook EVERY DAY , and that's just a website for when you want to share all your personal information with a monolithic corporation that never forgets ! !
WHAT IF . . . T - REX WERE VERY VERY TINY ?
A REVELATION :
ARE YOU SURE THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE JOKE TO MAKE THEN
I'd use the " Beth of both worlds " one in a circumstance in which I would otherwise describe Beth as the BEST of both worlds , Dromiceiomimus .
What's it say ?
Wait . What kind of " edible food " does your machine produce ?
EXTREMELY _ _ _ _ _ _ _ !
Now she's going to jail !
It's a good story ! It's heartwarming and the theme is that , SOMETIMES , people can fall in love . Aww ! Everyone loves to be reminded of that !
Whenever you feel angry and think maybe you shouldn't be upset , just repeat to yourself , " Don't be so angry okay ? Sheesh ! "
You're under arrest for hacking into our computer and also it's still playing your game and it controls our nukes and it's definitely going to start WW ] | [ by launching them against the Soviets . Cold War , remember ?
F -
HEY WHAT'S UP
No , I wasn't lying !
Heck , I probably wasn't going to kiss anyone this month ANYWAY .
WHAT IS THE BEST SENTENCE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMICS
It's so obvious !
What else could he have meant ?
ENOUGH !
now's my chance !
Man ! Don' leave me hangin' ! !
But ALSO " Shakespeare impersonations that don't my me mad " ; why didn't he do that one ?
Now when I'm asleep and I burp in a hilarious way , I'm not to be made to feel bad about it ! When I wake up , we can ALL share a laugh together , okay ? ? And the same goes if I pass gas or pick my nose or whatever . TOTALLY HILARIOUS , and also TOTALLY NOT MY FAULT .
- ultravomit , a new form of vomit that was digesting him alive ! As his skin began to dissolve , T - Rex's face melted , slid down the side of his neck , and plopped onto the ground .
" SO HARD "
Nope ! But once you see how totally naked we are , you can't really unsee it , huh ?
Another shot in the arm !
I'll take the latter . Goodbye forever , T - Rex !
No they won't !
One day I tried to sell a story about a talking dog , but people thought the premise was too -
Wow ! It recasts Western military culture and tools as religious practice and iconography , respectively !
Finally , am I right ? ?
Hey , are you going around telling people stories ?
Hey T - Rex , what's up ? You seem kinda - silent !
It seems like this is just going to be annoying .
That ? s not important now . What IS important is that you ? ve had a frank discussion about health and safety with your partners , and made sure everyone knows what everyone else ? s limits are . What do they hope to take away from this experience ? How do they ?
" The difference between a universe with T - Rex and one without is negligible "
Remaking a game can't be updated AND more accessible , and changes CAN be made without changing the fundamental appeal to the game !
Clark ?
And if Rob is real tired , then the program will change " TIRED " to caps ! Because bikes have tires ! !
It was nothing : just a crazy dream !
Let's be honest : it's 100 % guaranteed that I'm not going to remember an appointment for a decade ! And I'd lose any piece of paper I wrote down a reminder on .
Plus , modern computers are way better than history ones to play first person shooters on .
Kapow !
I can never solve my ACTUAL problems because I'm always dealing with problems caused by my problems , or problems caused by my problem's problems .
Sounds like a good analogy to me !
But he probably gets that all the time . I don't want to come across as a fan ! I should strike up a conversation and then mention all casually that I like his work , but that I'm not a " fan " or anything . But that might be insulting ! I'll - I'll just admire him from a distance .
And that's still suspicious !
Just - you know , in general ! I wasn't talking about anyone in particular .
I'm sure I have no idea what you're tal -
TWO WEEKS LATER , T - REX STILL ISN'T MARRIED . HE'S HAPPY THOUGH ! HE'S HOSTING AN AWESOME PARTY INSTEAD ! IT'S SO COOL !
Aha ! But waht if I only read the English ones ?
FIVE MINUTES LATER , UTAHRAPTOR DOES NOT MEET T - REX IN THAT ALLEYWAY :
This also applies to animation !
Dromiceiomimus , ask me if there will ever be a way to stop the sun from running down . Ask me if there will ever be a way to prevent the entire Universe from cooling down and dying . Ask ne if entropy can ever be reversed .
Or am I merely . . . TIRED AND SICK of them ?
What about the D'Orsay ? It's a beaver hat with a curved brim , but as much as , say , the Wellington .
Aww . I'd be a cutie !
. . . REVEALING PERSONAL TRUTHS ABOUT OURSELVES !
New ideas and themes from the Bard WOULD really be something !
. . . But it's okay . I CAN MAKE BETTER SLANG . For example , Dromiceiomimus , you shall now be known as " Vitamin D " !
But circuit - SAT can not be solved quickly .
By we , I mean of course the membership of the People Who When They Hear A Story About An Avoidable And Crazy Death , Laugh As Is Expected Of Them And Then Make A Mental Note To Not Do That Thing Anymore .
Khan !
" You don't need God to dump someone " ?
T - REX PRESENTS : VEGETABLES ? !
Dromiceiomimus , just recently this dude was found dead with shards of glass in his heart ! You know what happened ? His new lava lamp was taking TOO FRIGGIN' LONG to warm up , so he put it on his stove and heated it , and it got too hot and exploded on him and he died .
Totally what I just said ! !
Are you thinking of having children ? I mean , sure , you probably think of having a lot of things , but is one of those children ? ?
STRICTLY AMATEUR HOUR , my friend . Your response leaves you open to further questions ! Instead , simply memorize and recite this one phrase : " There's a lot going on , but I can't talk about it just yet . What about you ? "
Not enough sand !
And it doesn't bother you that these dinosaurs can talk ?
Ah . Of course .
YES , IT IS TOO LATE FOR REGRETS
You'd prefer zero tolerance ?
i guess she didn't get me any souvenirs
And the question is : who would win in a fight ?
Alright dudes , let's find out once and for all why bad things can happen to good peopl - -
Wow , you got here fast ! You either skipped ahead , or camped a while . I admire your patience . . . or lack thereof .
BIKE RIDES
Unfortunately , no !
I am the EXCITED one .
Ah . So we're still burning through oil much faster than it's being formed .
Utahraptor ! You were totally a jerk to me just now ! And if you're hoping I'm going to shout after you that " Now I wish my HEART couldn't feel pain " , I'm not !
I like it though . Huh , maybe they DO fight crime ! And their base could be in a . . . SUBWAY ? ?
If I can't be a bog person , I can be the next best thing !
SOON : NOBODY WANTS TO BUY T - REX'S HOME - MADE COMICS :
For someone who says he isn't " bicurious " you sure spend a lot of time talking about it !
IS DUCK HUNT A GOOD GAME
Sorry ?
A Ghost Story With A Spooky Mood , by Steven King !
The Minbari watch people sleep because when someone is sleeping , their true face is revealed .
Whoops ! Butterfingers !
But friends forever , right ?
You know what ? Don't mind if I do !
The answer : me !
I was hoping your adventure would take you out of town for a few days !
And raise children .
You can barbecue vegetables , T - Rex . I'll bring some vegetables and I'll show you how !
shucks utahraptor , that's awful good advice , but wouldn't you end up liking your free time but then feeling bad taht you have to spend the biggest part of your day with folks that aren't even your friends ? and it really doesn't seem like you're allowed to ask how friendly folks are during a job interview
All he wants to do is talk about these stupid games I've never played ! He KNOWS I've never played them , and yet - the chatter CONTINUES !
Attention , naked and sexy ( yet non - exploited ! ) members of the attractive sex ! I KNOW
? Seriously ? Seriously ? ?
WHERE ARE THEY NOW ? CELEBRITIES FROM THE 80S :
Well , that's just YOUR opin -
Weird . Well , have you also been bitten by a Dracula and turned into a Dracula ?
Forsooth .
So why are you raging here against people on the internet ? Why not post a scathing reply online ?
LATER , AT THE PUBLISHING HOUSE :
I know it , dude !
THOSE CAN FAIL TOO
But any character can pull that off . It doesn't have to be Shakespeare .
You guess correctly ! !
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to survive being flattened by a steamroller , as long as there's an air hose nearby ?
And there's no sign of Christmas being cancelled either !
I've entered a poetry contest !
Correct ! However , in contrast , THIS national animal of Saudi Arabia eats hay , has four legs , and is good at running !
MMM GREETINGS T - REX WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE RISE OF CASUAL GAMING
Darling won't you ease my worried mind ? ?
Okay . Andtonio flicked his cigarette into the fireplae and glared back at the cop . " Amelia can't be dead . I saw her this morning . "
YES ! Yes , no more shame ! !
What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving AFTER it did in our timeline ? You'd have no computers at all , and people riding around on horses saying " Gosh I wish we invented computers ! Goooossssh ! "
I am PRETTY SURE that I could be a pretty great soccer player if I really tried to be ! I just haven't explored it ! It's probably one of my many
No sleep could possibly compare with my sleep from last night ! Even in the sleep of death I will be all , " this sleep is pretty good ; but man , that OTHER sleep I had ? It was rad . It was so RAD . "
Trouble in paradise ?
Wanna take the day off and play video games ?
Others pay for the privilege of standing around watching others produce music on a stage . This bizarre behaviour is thought " normal " .
My friends , I have written a new book !
What ? No he didn't ! Sherlock Holmes kept his clothes on .
Come to think of it , I'd be pretty pissed if someone broke up with me like this !
Man ! I thought Barosaurus and I were at Friend Level Tell Me In Person , but I GUESS we're really at Friend Level Find Out If You Ever Check Facebook !
That's Inaccessibly Crazy , which is its own beast all together !
You're not worried how suspicious it is for someone to be SO CONCERNED with appearing innocent ?
Prepare to lose your job for gibbering madness all the time !
April Fool's !
Executive Producer DICK WOLF
I babysat a pterodactyl last night . It was pretty fun , I red him his favourite stories , we played some games , but then I lost him so I ate some sandwiches and went home .
No ! No more breaking shit , ok ?
Hey , can I bid some ANTI - DOLLARS on your pictures ?
Okay ! We'll get you a flight suit : that'll push your limit up to 9 G . Wait - still not good enough ? Well , we COULD submerge you in a liquid that has the same density as your body .
OOPS
Then I go back in time to BEFORE the Titanic was even built , and publish my story as a thinly - fictionalized novel ! You know , shorten the name to the " Titan " , increase the speed of the boat a bit , throw in a few polar bears living on the iceberg that the survivors have to battle - - the usual . Then I wait for the ACTUAL event and kapow : instant fame !
COMPRESSED SONG COMICS " SURF CITY " BY THE BEACH BOYS
Also , I would like there to be explicit instructions for my pals not to chew on the pencils because that's kinda super gross , please !
I just don't want to be one of those guys who let's being old be - all they do , you know ? Being old is at best incidental to what I do , and what I do is BE TOTALLY RAD .
But T - Rex , isn't the current scientific thinking that the universe will expand forever , but in doing so become a lifeless frozen expanse just above absolute zero due to increases in entropy ?
I suppose you're proposing we somehow make " work " more entertaining ?
Civilization goes back thousands of years ! Building and advancing civilization has got to be the single longest multi - generational project EVER UNDERTAKEN .
I mean , I GUESS that's kinda metal , but I dunno . Could this be put into a more relatable analogy somehow ? ?
Actually , MOST accurate is " T - Rex does not exist " because that works before I was born too !
But we can grow it in home preserves , right ?
LATER RELIGIOUS PRACTICES STILL NOT SUBJECT TO SCIENTIFIC METHOD
Rule by prostitutes ! And I didn't make it up . The word's been used in historical times to refer when popes were influenced by women !
It's called a wastebasket diagnosis : a disease with symptoms so broad as to be effectively meaningless . But it can do real good ! Having a named disease can lower patient anxiety and even help alleviate symptoms !
I'm DYING
In dystopian science fiction , we often find ourselves in a world where robots have taken over , and we are left doing a menial task that the machines either can't or don't care to do . This experience is now available in board game form !

Oh my gosh , you're saying -
WELL , FIVE REALLY
Okay ! Remember , that if you think we're not pals anymore you are only compounding your wrongness !
Exactly ! We're surrounded by Cybernetic systems ! !

Oh boo hoo the climate is changing . Well guess what , nerds ? The climate changes all the time ! !
No way dudes ! Nothing you can say will scare me !
If I were the recipient of this card , I would be DEFINITELY be exploring these scenarios in my imagination right now ! ! Nothing else to do when you're home alone , right ?
In a meritocracy all jobs , including government jobs , are assigned based on MERIT . So if you're the best at a job then it's yours , regardless of your sex or gender or race or stupid mustachio or anything !
Wait . Why CAN'T I eat ice cream every day ?
Dromiceiomimus , I'll give you the punchline and you'll supply the identifiable social group to be mocked , okay ? The puchline is : " Just one : they hold the lightbulb still while the world revolves around them . "
- then there's an alternate reality where 100 different houses were chosen !

Who is the best at video games ? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , I put to you a simple answer :
I've got girl troubles , Shakespeare !
Tonight at 11 : what you're eating that could be taking TWENTY YEARS off your life ! !
This means that I eschew formal schooling and learn on my own terms at my own pace , Dromiceiomimus ! I learn things that interest me and don't rely on someone else to tell me what I should and should not know .
This is just software that adds crappy puns to everything !
Ours is an imperfect world , and as such there's no perfect dudes in it . All the dudes we have are imperfect instances - copies , if you will - of the ideal dude , who is so great he can't even EXIST .
Cool , me too
And finally , this whole discussion is ridiculous because some folks DO dress up fancy all the time . You know what we call them ? WELL - DRESSED .
Later : T - Rex gets visited by a gang of Buddhists :
SHOULD BE
Like twin tattoos ?
THE BOOK'S A HIT ! BUT . . . WHAT TO DO FOR A SEQUEL ? ?
It can be tiring if you are meeting a lot of new people at once , however . Here are some tips on how to meet lots of people at once :
You know those guys who have been hiccuping for 70 years or whatever ? I'm glad I'm not one of those guys .
IF THESE LINES HAVE NOT PRODUCED A SATISFYING RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU , THEN YOU HAVE MESSED UP AND FAILED TO DEPLOY THEM PROPERLY
Hah hah , looks like we'll never know because we evolved brains that think it's cool to forget things without permission !
But that's not really fair either !
But he didn't get smarter than Nat : instead , Chris's brain was filled with everything Nat knew , PLUS Chris's existing memories . Chris could now remember two childhoods , two histories , two sets of feelings for their mutual friends , could revisit conversations from both sides . And whenever something new hapened to Nat , Chris got it too .
EXACTLY . Wizards change the world with their words , and some people talk in their sleep without even realizing it . Why take the chance ? You could wake up turned into a couch or something , and would that be awesome ? No , it wouldn't . People would put their butts on you . Gross .
You're sure it's not autobiographical ? No problems with the tax man ?
Have you ever played one ?
HOW ? How is that a threat ?
What if that puts you on the course to a better relationship ?
My favourite is mashed potatoes ! I've left extra room in my stomach for mashed potatoes !
Dude , me ! Like all men , I secretly believe myself to be fully capable of punching out God .
Hah ! Shakespeare's already QUITE the character , believe you me ! !
Wow , that's exciting ! I wonder who'll be at the party tonight ?
We'll be saying this when we're 50 years old , you know . We'll still be installing friggin' updates .
Exactly . Plus , the urea in urine is high in nitrogen , which is a fertilizer for lots of oceanic plants ! Science says that everyone should pee in the ocean whenever they want ! !
Did it work ?
PRETTY SURE FREEZING DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
But it makes things pretty depressing . Watch an action movie and you can thin " That could be me , if my chums and I were ever sent into space to blow up an asteroid . " But there's no way I can become Spider - man OR Hulk ! Or Flash . Or Green Lantern or even Black Canary .
Doesn't technology have to be implanted to make you a cyborg ?
My God .

It can be tricky !
What ? I never said " Teri Hatcher " ! I meant knowledge in general .
I did ! In fact , I thought ALL the music you brought over were corkers !

DOUG IS GROWING A HITLER MUSTACHE
No , really ! It's an expression of love , which is almost by definition inexpressible to someone else . Marrying young probably just seems crazy to you because you didn't meet the right person at that age !
I used to be a guy who'd say , " Historians : nice folks ! They are Most Definitely not screwing with us . "

Not bad , not bad . But the mettle of any true writer is measured by a sad story in a mere FOUR words .

HAPPINESS COMICS
Consider " It's My Wife " , " Wife After Death " ( sometimes these songs get sad ) , " This Is The Wife " ( a spouse may need pointing out ) , " Bring Me To Wife " ( even GRAMMAR ITSELF cannot hold in the face of such raw emotion / transport demands ) , and " The Circle Of Wife " . It moves all all , Utahraptor .
Ridiculous ! So can falling down the stairs , but that doesn't mean that's awesome !
Can't mice also live outdoors ?
Yep ! In either case : dear recipient of this card , thank you for the invitation on Facebook , but I will not be attending the party !
FINE . Here's a non - racist horse joke : why do horses like to waterski ? The answer is " I don't know , but it's definitely NOT because they're horses . "

I call my game " Super Mary Oh And The Slutty Dude " !
Like walking , but wish you could end up way sweatier and gross at the end ?
In the past I have called my fists " Knuckles and Chuckles " , and then later upgraded to the truly compelling " Rocco and Choco , the Twins ! Who ! Punch ! " but now I have an even better nickname !
God .
Sure ! Um . . . how about -
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Minus the eggs !
Oh . Okay .

Hah hah ! I don't believe it ! T - Rex - you're afraid of raccoons !
That's " EL OH EL JAY KAY "
Twists upon twists ! !
This may be my last entry .
This year I resolve to stop stressing about my backhairs so much ! !
What a dick !
Wow ! !
Because he always has to pay for everything !
LATER STILL : T - REX DOESN'T ACTUALLY EVER GET KIDNAPPED
No , that would be monstrous .
Sure , but that's fine !
Um , that's history ? ?
FACT : babies are fragile too ! They're like - glass people !
I suppose it shows that people aren't motivated ENTIRELY by greed , even in situations involving money and a stranger you'll never see again .
LET'S LEARN ABOUT STAIRS
If I was writing a western I could go on and on about order versus freedom , civilization versus the wilderness , the hero as a man stuck between these two worlds , and so on ! But what's science fiction about ? Is it just literature with space ships and robots and casually inverted flux variance ? Aliens stopped being parallels for The Other long ago , didn't they ?
I saw it ! !
. . . PROCEED
Attention , news networks ! ! I'm beginning to think you don't take my proclamations at all seriously .
Oh my god , Dromiceiomimus
Friggin' cheeseburgers !
" Honestly though , I will always treasure the time we had together . I liked who I was with you - who we were together - and I hope we'll both be able to take that with us in the future . You've changed me and you're a part of who I am . I know our relationship will be different now , but I can't imagine ever not loving you . "
now with executive summary !
QUITE POSSIBLY ?
Yes , I do ! !
Or at least -
Hah , the next thing you know , I'll have a wacky but non - threatening gay frien -
When I eat I'm SPITTING AT DEATH IN THE FACT , and you know that's extra gross because I've got chewed - up food in my mouth . Outdoors there's a constant chance of getting hit by a falling object , or falling into a hole and BECOMING that falling object that hits someone else AND YET HERE I AM . Yeah , I'm pretty much awesome .
I just saw a nice horse ( ! ) , you guys !
NOBODY KNOWS WHY
A large benevolent corporation , properly directed , could easily do much more good than a lone vigilante in a single city .
LATER , T - REX COMPLETES HIS STORY AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A PERFECT , WORD - FOR - WORD DUPLICATE OF " OF MICE AND MEN " :
No . YOUR past .
I TAKE IT ALL BACK
So if you were throwing a party , would you invite a taxi driver ?
WELL , I've been seeing this new guy , and it's nice . We went out to a movie last night and he held my hand when the lights went down . It was classy ! And things are good with you ?
HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOUR RAMBLEY STORIES
So um , why hasn't anyone done this already ?
I know ! What is the friggin' deal ?
" Wouldn't that be sad ? "
Time to make some Life Decisions , set some Life Goals !
utahraptor's skin flavoured jello
OKAY , THIS IS ME NARRATING NOW , T - REX . I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CAPTAIN ROBERT SCOTT . YOU'LL BE SCOTT .
LATER , AT THE BANK :
No no , sorry , I should have specified : I'm from the RECENT past . Like , past three years . I'm walking around saying " Oh , wow ! Check out all these incremental improvements . "
Oh no , you guys !
They privately ask scientists for nominations .
Geez , WHO KNOWS ?
My best theory is that criminally insane are buying up all the copies , concealing them under their jackets , and smuggling them into cottages the world over .
A psychology student , I guess ! That's just because I don't really know any music students , though .
Also , try not to eat fire ! Your digestive system is ill - equipped to deal with it and it has extremely low nutritional value .
Oops . Oh well !
That's not a false document , T - Rex ! Shakespeare was a real guy , and dictionaries actually exist . It's more like if , I don't know , the Necronomicon was read by a Shakespeare CHARACTER .
I just was hoping to hear more about you and your life right now , you know ? How'd that Nazi Pin thing work out for you ?
So you want to hit on him , get shot down , and then characterize things in such a way that the blame's on HIM for not wanting to date you ? ?
Early photography took SO LONG that everyone's dour resting face was the norm ! And painting's even longer . Past generations WANTED to look cool and good but had to settle for an eternity of " wow what's THEIR problem ? ? " . So we should smile , not just for us , but for all who came before us and couldn't ! !
I am a firm believer in the " do nothing and your problems will take care of themselves " school of problem solving .
Oh God , live autobiography !
The freshest !
That is not yet on my list of acceptable excuses
Every good superhero power is taken . He's invulnerable - oh , there's Superman . Okay , he CAN be hurt , but he recovers : oh , hey Wolverine ! Okay , he CAN be hurt , and then , he dies . Oh , Batman's at this party too ? Hey Batman .
That's actually way better than the last one .
It is , and you started it !
Nice ! Okay , fine , I'll say it . Sometimes . . .
If I want to give a very serious and momentous speech about the history of war , I can ! But if I also want it to begin with " Now this is a story all about how some lives got flipped , turned upside down " ? I CAN'T . It is a perfectly awesome introductory phrase that is forbidden to me - unless I'm cool with my audience and being distracted by thoughts of young Willard Smith ! Fresh Prince used scorched earth tactics when withdrawing from the phrase .
Arrange all of my breakfasts from worst to best , and one's going to come out on top . I believe there are easily enough variables involved in breakfast that if you look closely enough , you can break any ties ! One breakfast will be best . And what kills me is I'll probably not even notice it !
By induction , you WILL eventually end up with more strange fictional alien " boner humanoids " , or " boneroids " , than actual ones .
Woo ! Our civilization is now stronger than GIANT PUDDLES ! !
I'm Just so happy that I have a new friend who is a tiny elephant . Oh my goodness , I can't say how happy that makes me . To think of all these years I was looking for happiness in RELATIONSHIPS and SOCIETY when all that I wanted . . .
Copious balls are being tripped over here too ! !
Yeah , man ! You should've totally built a robot suit !
Wait , there's a message on the back of the letter ! It says " Boo - berry muffins " . Ghosts like to eat . . . boo - berry muffins .
A nostalgia - sauce sandwich of FREEBASED NOSTALGIA PILLS .
And since it's Hallowe'en , the prize is NOT ONLY a date with me ( T - Rex ! ) but it's a HELLA CREEPY date with me ( T - Rex ! ) . I'll arrive two hours early , stand perfectly still across the street , and peer into your window with binoculars . I'll ring the doorbell while pressing my eye up against the peephole . I'll ask you how your day was and whenever you use the pronoun " I " I'll suck my fingers . I will be only MODERATELY discreet about it . Happy Hallowe'en !
In the past , we did not have a very good understanding of our world , and so attributing storms and such to God made sense .
Also in the story , a character or narrator does something , or thinks about doing something , or recalls when they did something !
No way dude ! You'd have to know the exact skills AND future potential of EVERYONE . If you had some omniscient and impartial third party then MAYBE , but you'll never get rid of cronyism when you have regular dudes trying to determine who's best . There's too much potential for authoritarianism and corruption !
What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving at the usual time ?
" Hello ? Hello ? I'd like to break up with Utahraptor . "
And then : instructions for decoding images that are about to be transmitted . In a few months we go from hoping we're not alone to knowing that intelligent life is out there , and they're about to show us what they look like !
STAGE 4 : WHAT AM I DOING , AND WHY
I SUPPOSE IF I AM BEING HONEST I HAVE SOMETIMES WISHED THAT MY FEMALE FRIENDS WERE MALE SO THAT I COULD GET CLOSER TO THEM WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT TIPPING INTO A RELATIONSHIP , AND THIS RESULTS IN A CERTAIN AWKWARD DISTANCE BETWEEN US AS SOMETIMES I HOLD THINGS BACK
I'm gonna ! !
I'm concerned that the plot to your novel seems a little familiar .
My phone died , so I got a new phone !
Totally works for Hitler , dude ! !

It sucks , because if everyone disagrees with you , then you'll never get anything you want . It's majority rule ! MOB rule !
Excuse me ! Everybody ? Would you say it's true that life is a neoclassical pastiche ?
Utilitarianism is an ethical system in which you always act to minimize pain and increase happiness ! This is the perfect system for me , as I am ALL ABOUT increasing happiness .
Ah , but are you considering the full Expanded Universe when you say that ?
Thanks ! !
Now another friend is posting lyrics from angry break up songs !
Hey , are you thinking what I'm thinking ? ?
There's a joke that says " to the lobsters in the kitchen , the sinking of the Titanic must've seemed like a miracle ! "
That one made me sad .
LIFE TRULY IS MAGNIFICENT , DUDES .
No and no ! I , unlike YOU , never do stuff like that .
DROMICEIOMIMUS
Yaaaaaay !
And so on until we have super duper smart machines that will look on us as mere playthings . Will they destroy us ? Or will we merge ourselves with technology , and in doing so become a new , more cybernetic lifeform ? Our choices seem limited to either becoming something new , or facing irrelevance and obsolescence !
Both of these seem like pretty expensive solutions !
If ghosts can kill ghosts , then the dead ghosts would come back . . . as ghosts !

My name's T - Rex and I'm here to say / That I'm the rappingest guy in the USA !
Yeah , it will probably cause a mistrial !

It's easy !
What's the cure ?
A lot of folks get tattoos commemorating life experiences they've had .
I LIKE TO DANCE IN MY UNDERPANTS T - REX
Yeah , maybe they know what they want , and that's to share their lives , and a beautiful child , with each other !
That's because I own a bullet with my name on it , ladies ! !
Where would we be without pretension ? We'd be short a few critical essays on Leonard Cohen , that's for sure .
Be still my beating heart !
SO BAD .
It is trillions and trillions of years in the future .
What's that , Dromiceiomimus ?
Vin Diesel ate a spider and then threw up on my living room floor ! What the hell ? ?
You really crapped the bed on this one !
Empathy : When Your Own Feelings Just Aren't Enough . ? Greed : You Deserve That . ? Live Life . Make Mistakes . Feel Regret . ?
Wait !
Dromiceiomimus here will be responsible for the basic rules of the road : when to go , when to stop , when to rush into an intersetion because your light's firggin' GREEN even though traffic's moving so slowly that there's no possible way you'll be out of the intersection before you block traffic .
Well guess what ?
I think I got rid of him !
We tell it like it is !
This makes for some pretty dumb plotlines / actual histories !
that's awful nice but it turned out that bugs don't even shop at the grocery store ! i must have gotten myself mixed up with a show i saw or a movie or something because we catch our food ourselves
The worst that could happen is ADVENTURES !
Yeah , but man !
Dromiceiomimus ! You're only doing this because you want a sandwich ! !
I - I can parse that sentence , but it feels like I'm making a mistake when I do ? Like there's sentences in English that shouldn't be said , and I'm somehow - tainted for having tried to understand yours .
That's exactly my fear !
Well , more accurately : I guess MOST people love classic video games ?
Comics are old hat , but you know what's new and exciting ? !
Only about 1 . 9 hours a day !
T - REX HAS GOTTEN A NEW PET DOG :
I meant to say " officially too salty for me " , and the " for me " was implied ! i'm still good at words ! i was speaking only for myself ! I WAS SPEAKING ONLY FOR MYSELF ! ! ] ]
I like bowling , but do I knuckle - tattoo like bowling ? I mean , PROBABLY ? ?
My mom laid an egg and then later on I PUNCHED MY WAY OUT !
Apparently , MY problem is a poisonous basement !
Is it once again time . . . FOR " SPOOKY PUBES " ? ?
Sounds like fun !
There's nothing wrong with a new language being a simple variant of English ! Heck , modern French is just a riff on middle Swedish !
T - Rex , you may have size - racisms and you should address that in yourself right away ! !
I hate being reminded of Zach .
HALF A VOMIT COMICS
These , um , aren't very deep insights , T - Rex .
I wonder if I'm the only one that feels as if he isn't living up to his own potential ?
Oh Crap , Who'S Gonna Shoot These Bad Guys ? ?
And make it really catchy , okay ?
Yes , I have a question to ask you !
Go on !
It is a pretty terrific use of money !
I will have to find another way to win his friendship !
Neato
No it's 3 : 31 pm EST .
I would also like not to die , please !
And let us further assume that everyone's parents had a biological mother and father too !
TURNS OUT SHE'S A NAUTICAL ENGINEER ?
. . . FOR GENEROUS VALUES OF " LITERALLY "
Well , they're not REALLY the same word , right ?
If you were offering a room for rent , wouldn't you want to include photos of the room ? And wouldn't you want to include more information than " ROOM 4 RENT PLZ B HOT " ? ?
Oh my GOSH puppies are aaAAAAAHHHHHHHHH -
Hah ! I'll bet you five dollars we can't find even one porn site that's about heavy and light skulls .
How old am I ? 27 ?
I don't think that's how medical science works !
And * I * report seeing her just over here , a few minutes ago !
I'm on it ! One press of my special " signal watch " will bring him here instantly !
Sure are ! How hard could it be ? It's just like climbing stairs , only longer !
I understand where you're coming from , Dromiceiomimus , but with respect , you need to let me finish .
That's a great idea !
I guess so . Anyway ! Let's go play TOUCH FOOTBALL !
i don't even know who you are ! !
I tell it like it is !
Everything burns , T - Rex !
Oh , it's one someone glued to the ground as a joke .
No , what was he wearing ?
Prove me wrong !
They're undermining it by choosing such hilarious names ! You know what it's called if you think the organic life is sent out on purpose by aliens ?
If the Eskimos have 500 words for snow , then surely we in our internet - stuff age should have 1000 words for " meh " !
Easy , with MY Kafkaesque " The Pre - Trial Conference " !
" Baby ! / I love you / And if you don't believe that / then what the Hell "
HOURS LATER . . .
That thing is the ability to feel physical pleasure !
" Well . . . "
LATER , AT HOME :
The only downside is she's got a growing army of friends who are all " inter - networked " together in an " inter - net " , so if one finds out a secret the rest NEVER FORGET . Also , her friends spy on you .
Anyway , this is how come I'm so into vegetables that look like celebs .
Yep ! It was like clenching a fist once a second !
That statement evaluates to true ! !
Everyone tries to learn from the perfect song , reverse - engineer it : Can we use it to produce the perfect painting ? Poem ? The perfect justice system ? But we fail . It seems Earth is to touch perfection but once , and this is it : one single song .
WHO THE HECK SAID THAT
Okay , hate isn't allowed either on account of house it's ARGUABLY the opposite of love .
That's right , ladies ! I'ma float in SPACE ! !
Some of it probably got turned into your body !
T - REX IN : " MY FRIED CHICKEN CYCLE "
That's what I say to them ! They say , T - Rex , Marcia and I are expecting a little bundle of joy . And I say , Ted , I respect you and love you as a friend , but I have to ask - what's the deal ? What is the deal with the BABIES .
Make up stuff that didn't happen ! Imagine lies , then write them down in order .
. . . the ANTITIME !
Oh sure ! No big deal , right ? ?
You move your guy into a house and then you live there , but if it's occupied then the other person dies of embarrassment ! Each square is a property , and it's a real - estate simulator . I don't know . Folks seem to like it .
And that's one mystery I'd prefer to leave unsolved ! I'm really enjoying this feeling of mysterious popularity .
EVEN NICER !
Um - you caught up on your reading , focusing mainly on periodicals ?
My friend , if you're going to be doing that much kissing , you'd better brush up a bit on it !
Bold ? Yes . Daring ? Absolutely . Brave , even intrepid ? No doubt . For these are all qualities I possess - and qualities I'd be willing to share . . . WITH A FRIEND .
I don't say , " He slumbers still ? Alack ! One thousand curses ! When the Sandman's spell at last lies vanquished at his feet , give him good heed : Doug has come calling . "
Guess what , everyone ?
Here I am !
" EUPHEMISMS " FOR DATING
AN APOLOGY TO PLANTS
Ah . So everyone's stealing my anti - ticket opinions INSTEAD of raising the roof . That's fine , that's cool .
Sure they do !
A FEW MINUTES LATER :
Okay , so according to HISTORIANS there was a dude named Tarrare who lived in France and ate a lot . And when he ran out of food , he ate scraps . And then garbage from the gutter . And then he joined the army where he gobbled a meal meant for 15 men , and then he ate a cat a live . And then he threw up its fur . And later he was hospitalized and then later accused of trying to eat CORPSES from the MORGUE .
Okay , time to invent a new superhero ! Then I'll make a movie about him , and THEN , I'll be famous ! Then I'll also have a lot of disposable income ?
Anyway , Kay wished that every decision she made would be the right one !
So what if truth is a platonic ideal that can't be reached ? I'm fine with that ! When someone says to me , " T - Rex , your birthday is this Saturday , " will I demand they prove it ? No . I will say " wicked sweettimes " and then I would say " what did you get me " and then I would say " I bet it's so awesome " and that will be that .
God , give me fifty dollars !
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS STOOD UP AGAIN , TODAY , ON CINCO DE MAYO .
Nobody wants to be patronized to , T - Rex .
Huh ! Well , I mean - I agree . There's no reason to prefer a more complex explanation when a simpler one has equal predictive power .
Man , that sounds like a threat !
It's a sad realization - I always sort of hoped such a job would just . . . fall into my lap !
BASED ON A TRUE STORY !
When I hit < u > you gonna take it on the chin / 80 years later , you're STILL typing markup in !
You roll your eyes at the word " cyberspace " !
To begin : your house is too small and your car is slightly out of scale ! And you ! Your colouring is improbable !
Hah ! HILARIOUS !
Yep ! ! And I'm going to walk over there and talk to him right now !
Yeah ! You exaggerate traits as you often do with racism , but you make them positive things instead of negative . Natives were better because they were all stoic and noble and loved Mother Nature . Okay , great , but what if you're native and you're not like that ?
But - she can have more , right ? She won't mind if one goes missing , right ?
Aww , that's very sweet T - Rex , but we'd hate to be the reason you don't go out and explore the world .
Also , I like Chinese New Year because it suggests the delightful Chinese Christmas .
A HARBINGER OF FRIENDSHIP :
Even death would offer no escape .
Oh yeah ? Well I'M so manly that I do that too , WHILE IMPREGNATING MY GIRLFRIEND .
EVERYONE , we are producing WAY too much culture !
You're taking it literally ?
You can't say that ! Class is important ! Class is really important .
That's pretty close - minded , T - Rex !
The world revolves around me The world revolves around me
We've got the perfect woman , and the perfect man , but you know what we're missing ?
Awesome ! ! Wow , thanks , Utahraptor ! You're a real friend !
Dentists weren't joking about a lot of things !
I named myself " homo sapiens sapiens " which stands for " smart smart human " ! We all thought that was a good idea ! I'm on the endangered species list under " LEAST CONCERN " because if I go extinct then by god , everyone else is too ! !
Yes ! I have actually done some research this time . Schwing !
Isn't it neat that we have this distinction in English between fewer and elss , but the opposite , " more " , covers both those cases ? Our language is ASYMMETRICAL . If you want to encode countability in your " greater than " comparison word , then good luck ! Hah ! GOOD LUCK WITH THAT , MY FRIEND !
I'm not impressed !
Okay . So I was wondering , in case I get this dream again , where do YOU fly when you dream about flying ?
So I believe !
I have written all the numbers from 1 to 1000 ! By hand . Just now .
Oh ! Um . . . throw . . . women , off the trail of my - feelings ?
THIS IS THE POLICE , T - REX ! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS .
Yeah , but you're only legally married when you sign the paperwork !
So let's say everyone else chose 100 - you'd want to choose 66 . 67 , because that's 2 / 3rds of 100 . But the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don't tell the other players .
Ill - advised hookups ! !
Maybe I'd suggest our honeybabe in question blundered . Did she just slip up , or did she totally botch it ? Maybe it was just an error ? A miscalculation ? An oversight ? A FAILURE ? The words we choose indicate how severe a mistake it was , but ALSO suggest various degrees of culpability , and most of us are pretty finely tuned to their nuances of meaning - even honeybabes !
Daaang , I totally did ! I try not to , but sometimes a gendered professional noun slips through . Am I truly . . . A MONSTER ?
SPOILER ALERT : HE BEATS YOU BY ALMOST A MONTH .
I've never read a lazered dude story that even compared to the LESSER works of Shakespeare !
Then Utahraptor showed up and T - Rex said " hi " !
For example , a dog might always be described as " that wacky jerk " in a story , to underline what a wacky jerk that dog turned out to be . Or in a collection of stories , the same phrase might appear in each story , which helps tie them together as a whole ! Leitwortstil ALSO happens when a character says the same word over and over and over again .
Yes , that'd likely have enough processing power to simulate one dude's life .
W - what , you want to eat me ?
Could one , in time , become the other ?
You're sure using a lot of qualifiers there , T - Rex !
Sadism is when you get pleasure inflicting pain on or humiliating someone else ! It's a sex thing ! !
Hey , your birthday really is this Saturday !
I would have thought you'd choose the bullet hole / water one !
Oh snap ! Is it " Everyone Owes Me Five Excellent Movie Ideas Thursday " AGAIN ? ?
And yet . . .
Bab
FRUSTRATION COMICS II
Plus , if we slow down Earth too much WE CRASH INTO THE SUN . Great work , SCIENTISTS ! Way to invent a DOOMSDAY DEVICE / ORBITAL TECHNIQUE !
T - REX THAT WAS THE WORST VISION OF THE FUTURE I HAVE EVER HEARD
Man , you're on !
Well MY beats are so sick that their breathing is shallow and mucussy !
um , being BORED
things are not the way they should be
Something that says , " This is an awesome dude ! " but also says " You should sign the guestbook ! "
AT THE PARK :
And 5 % of us show this GENETIC MUTAT - ION .
When we had SEX !
Yeah ! Yeah , that's right ! It doesn't work on yellow .
Who are you talking to , T - Rex ?
Hey T - Rex , want to go see a movie with me ?
That reminds me , throw some eggs into this ! Then add salt to taste , and add more eggs to taste too . Serve in a bathtub and garnish with fifty dollar bills !
yesssss
Wait - what are we running from ?
RESOLUTION ONE :
While H . A . T . s CAN be used to communicate status , occupation , rank , the weather , or the fact that you're a fancy person watching a fancy horse race , they're fully optional . Just like . . . all other clothes ? ?
Today I am talking about the made - up desease " ryoma " , and there are many kinds of ryoma one can contract !
One time there was a machine that , given a sample of your blood , could tell you how you're going to . . .
It is . Technically !
" Actionfigureocracy " ?
I do not understand this !
ALL GENRES . Let's come up with the song that is OBJECTIVELY BEST across ALL TIMELINES . None of the standard " this succeeds as a classical aria but largely fails as a dubstep anthem " . BEST EVER .
ONLY IF CIRCUMSTANCES DEMAND IT .
I want my funeral to be _ _ _ _ _ _ _ !
Sure ! It seems rational , plus it gives up hope that we could design a computer with a consciousness and - dare I dread - a soul !
WHEN TO USE " HOLY SMACKERELS " :
What's for dinner tonight , T - Rex ?
15 G .
Thoughts of mortality , I see !
" Unlikely but desirable even happened in front of an observer , making my historical analysis complicated and annoying " .
LATER T - REX FINDS OUT THIS IS AN ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS CALLED " THE NEMESIS HYPOTHESIS " :
CAN I CREATE AN OBJECT SO VALUABLE EVEN I CAN'T HEIST IT
And then , out of all the careers to end up in , she grew up to be Dommi " the Dominatrix " Natrix .
Like teens !
SCREW IT , WE'LL WEAR SWEATERS AND EAT HOT HOT CHILI
We're here to name babies , and instead you're making fun of the couples who had some cool sex SO INEPTLY that they all ended up pregnant .
Never have I been so bored by corn
Yes , they will !
Hey , how many imaginary aliens did you imaginarily shoot today ?
And seriously , if it's not safe to eat chalk then it's DEFINITELY safe to eat sawdust . And even if it's not , there's got to be things that'll pass through you ENTIRELY UNDIGESTED but that also won't cause any harm when you gobble them !
It doesn't make any sense !
That's exactly the problem !
T - Rex I've heard you say that about every possible demographic - whether it's age , gender , or race .
EVERYONE ! OBSERVE MY BEACH NUDITY !
ALRIGHT , I WILL STOP BEING COY . I TOTALLY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE . LET'S ALL GET EXCITED NOW , OKAY ?
LATER , T - REX GETS THE FLU !
Those seem creepy and emo respectively ! What's that last one : a breakup card ?
Okay anyway !
Vampires ?
Look , I'm going to prototype it tonight , so by this time tomorrow , we'll see what's what .
Then you eat a mushroom , and you become a bigger plumber !
I'll think of something !
Also " Now Whose Written A Grammar Text ? "
- - is also named Skellington . You ARE lost , friend . Our town isn't on any maps . You've met with a terrible fate , haven't you ?
But you couldn't sell this , because most calendars would be starting and ending on different days !
. . . bags of poop !
WITH NEW GRAPHICS DELIVERING ASTOUNDING NEW VISTAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN
And that's just the entry - level curse , dude !
And this is PROBABLY why sexin' is fun times !
That's all you've got ?
If this be paranoia , I would like a double - down refill please !
Alright , this is blues riff in B . Watch me for the changes , an uh , try to keep up .
" CATS AND KITTENS "
Man , how great would it be to have a TATTOO ? Assuming it does not go disastrously wrong , it would be super cool !
Maybe you should stop being such a CRAZY RACIST ? ?
Damn it
All the memories I have - both of the place and of myself when I lived there - cannot help but to fade and alter with time , becoming truncated , inconsistent , impressionary . . .
The guy stopped firing and typed " u speak polish ? ? "
I recommend everyone try it .
And I'll prove it to you ! I'll track down Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird and find out , alright ? And then you'll all have to apologize to me and say " Oh , T - Rex , I was so wrong ! Teamwork is the REAL treasure . "
And to make it interesting let's assume these " humans " are conscious ! Each and every one !
So why are we here ?
Who wants to party ? Because THIS GUY is totally ready to party .
" HOLLABACK GIRL "
Hello ! my baby / Hello ! my honey / Hello ! my ragtime gal / Send me a kiss by wire / Baby , my heart's on fire !
Did you think maybe they just found the right person ?
Utahraptor I made myself sad ! !
Ewww !
Your make is bad !
If you have a problem , turn to panel 2 ! If you don't have any problems , turn to panel 6 !
Arguably , that's what fantasy stories are , aren't they ?
If they made " Horse Game 64 " , I would TOTALLY buy that game !
" WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES ! ; ) "
Okay , here's one dude who's going to go back in time and stop the Big Bang from exploding , and he's not going to kill a thousand dudes . He's going to kill ALL LIFE THAT HAS OR EVER WILL BE . the only way to stop him is to kill him . If you keep with your rule and let him go , everybody dies ! T - REX , YOU ARE A MONSTER .
Man , some dudes are EXTREME ! ! enough to snowboard down Mount Everest ! There's a real chance you could be killed doing that , PLUS , only a few people have ever done it . I'd call that " adventure " !
Um dude , says here you did !
Yeah , but there's more to being smart than knowing compression schemes !
OPPORTUNITY knocks on doors , you guys !
The plague of their Times , the Dinosaur was known for taking Plaesure in rendering one's abode or Self flatten'd .
I'm doing it ! !
MEANWHILE , IN THE MIND OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE :
EXCUSE ME
You meet some eloquent people !
Ah , you refer to last Saturday night when you went nude swimming " by accident " .
You don't want to hear how this ends ?
I AM ACTUALLY SERIOUS
Dude , I don't still use a single piece of software I used 10 years ago ! That trend seems likely to continue .
Yes ! So here's my trouble . . .
I cannot stress this enough ! !
So Burger King , you can stay the hell home ! ! The athletes competing here , these Adonises and Adonisettes , they don't need your fatty foods and empty calories ! They have BIG MACS ( TM ) and QUARTER POUNDERS WITH CHEESE ( TM ) lovingly crafted by McDonald's , who've turned the full force of their multinational corporation towards ensuring no athlete , no matter WHERE they live on the planet , will ever be inconveniently far away from a handful of fries served in a paper sleeve !
There was a time of which upon . . rested . . . a dog ?
My point is that books haven't had constant , directed development : rather , every author starts almost from scratch ! And that's AFTER we waste our early years learning what a word even is . A metaphor : we're running a 10k race , and all we do is stumble around in those first 100 meters and then DIE .
I bet if * I * did it , I'd be way more of a poseur than you !
And shopping for food that I didn't even need , no less . I suspect that the symbolism of this at both a personal and societal level is pretty damning !
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORLD :
TIP : " Safesearch " may appear to be on . YOU ARE NOT SAFE . YOU WILL NEVER BE SAFE .
Something is amiss !
Aww , I really respect you and wish to spend more time with you in a romantic fashion , too !
I don't see a punchline !
MMM GREETINGS T - REX I HAVE A QUERY OF A PERSONAL NATURE
So my new story will be about a man whose problem is he weeps all the time . He's not sad , his eyes just produce water like it's going out of style . And he tells everyone that it's just a biological thing and he's very happy to see them , but they all suspect he's sad . They say " Are you alright ? " and he says " YES dammit I just got leaky eyes . " Then he locks his weeping eyes with them and says " What's for dinner ? "
God ! Can YOU be an omniscient and impartial third party for me ?
Those became less funny and more " things you do with cellphones " .
G -
Maybe it's like a fairy Prime Directive thing !
As much as my personal potential for fighting crime and righting wrongs , I gotta say !
One , my body needs to survive in space , two , it needs to be able to eat paper in an emergency , three , flight would be nice , also , four , sometimes when I'm sleeping I get a cramp in my leg muscles and I have to punch the muscles .
LATER : MEDICAL SCHOOL !
Sherlock Holmes strapped himself in for a journey . . . THROUGH TIME ! !
We've tried to make allowances for you , but it's just so impossible to be your friend . I don't even know what you're thinking right now ! Everything you say is like this impossible linguistic Rorschach test .
UTAHRAPTOR ! The most salacious of all raptors !
It was this guy . He did it . T - Rex . This guy .
Hey hey hey !
There's TONS of horrible diseases that sound like they're just made up by somebody , but actually do exist . Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva , in which connective tissue becomes bone , freezing a person in place ! The Capgras delusion , in which loved ones appear to be replaced by identical imposters ! And these are just the two I know about .
SAYS HERE IT'S BECAUSE OF GAMEPLAY CONCERNS
It is during this time that you will begin to despise the Brother Parker .
They keep calling , you should probably call them back dude !
And then Mr . Darcy shows up in HIS robot suit , and he holds up a sign that says , " Forsooth , I had forgotten I ownned this robot Suitte " ?
Then why don't you do anything about it ?
T - REX GIVE ME THREE GOOD REASONS WHY I SHOULDN'T DESTROY THIS UNIVERSE IN FAVOR OF A NEW ONE FEATURING GINGER PEANUY AND SPARKY
Perhaps via some sort of SIGNALLING WATCH ? One which I'm LITERALLY ALWAYS WEARING ? ? JIMMY OUT , FOOLS .
Like - the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow , and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child . For children you pat several heads !
OH MY GOD HOLD ON A SECOND HER NAME SOUNDS LIKE HER JOB !
ALSO KNOWN AS :
Like , today , we think the universe is roughly spherical and finite .
Ha ha , of course not ! This was just a hilarious test . Um .
Yep ! As I say , it makes sense .
Well , has the book been published ?
Man ! I GUESS .
And she's super smart , too !
THAT'S CREEPY ? !
How do you even make friends as an adult ? ?
IT'S MANDATORY .
Nope ! I've got nothing .
In other news , being cognizant is so totally sweet !
THIS ISN'T EVEN A GOOD AUGUST FACT
We can only imagine what it must have been like -
Man , I know it ! !
Sir
YOU JUST GOT REAL TALKED MY FRIEND
Science dudes !
Hmm , a bit tight on space here . Yo , should I delete / MEMORIES2000 / oldmemories / HiGhScHoOL / stuff / stuff222 / whatever . dat , or MEMORIES / unsorted / how _ to _ play _ power _ rangers _ theme _ on _ a _ touchtone _ phone . txt ? ?
The sender's weird . I'm gonna assume she's a woman ! She types in random email addresses she thinks are cool and then sends them web cards . What's her deal ?
A party of functions !
OMG MY GOD !
A primitive cyborg ?
ONE YEAR LATER :
I just want to pat them on the head and ruffle their hair , you know ?
ARE YOU A DRACULA ? A HANDY FLOWCHART TO FIND OUT
How do I feel about matrimony ?
I am keeping all my awesome rad opinions to myself today .
FACT : Dogs are alive . Some of them , anyway ! !
Wow ! Is he really that angry ?
No , but that's the thing !
FFFFRRRIIII -
Hey Utahraptor ! Why don't bats live alone ?
When someone accidentally gets sent to the past , they always make sure to write a letter held in trust and delivered to their friends decades later , telling them that they made it alright !
It never is , with you !
I'd be more into water if they called it JAZZY JUIZ , and I'd be way big into air if they called it DEATH - B - GONE GAS . It's such a good name !
I'd love to !
Whoaaahhhh
Today is a good day I think for more SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION !
I can already see where that would go : a discussion of how style sells cars and bumpers are subject to that , but how government controls could legislate that all bumpers be a standard height , thereby saving lives . THEN , we could segue into internationalization problems with how foreign car makers might not want to redesign their cars for only our market , but we still need cars , so hey , let's talk corporate control over our national interests ! AND SO ON .
YES WELL THAT'S WHY I INVENTED THE PLACE T - REX
finito
No . T - Tex or nothing .
They CHEAT !
Seriously ? Wow , I guess you're right , huh ? Huh ! Well , that really puts my travel plans in perspective .
Oh hey , Dromiceiomimus , my wackiest of wacky friends ! What are you up to ? Some crazy scheme , no doubt !
- wouldn't be enough !
" Atmosphere can distort starlight , but actually the light is consistent . "
Incidentally , that would be a good phrase to say to an ex - girlfriend you're trying to hook up with ! The " start over " one , I mean . Um .
Oh no ! WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING . . . when dogs are choosing what to think about ? !
So let's hear what you've written so far !
Well - by " book " I really meant " T . V . show " .
T - REX COMICS
But I gotta say , there's this one forbidden tree that has this AMAZING fruit and you should definitely eat some right away .
This sounds complicated !
ALL THE CORPORATIONS ARE REAL PEOPLE NOW
What's that , T - Rex ?
It's just - a preemptive sadness , I guess ? Melancholy . By " melancholy " I mean " a thoughtful sadness " as opposed to the archaic definition ( " a black bile once believed to be excreted by the kidneys " ) .
Then I guess I'd give it to the soccer players ?
But what if I removed that desire for happiness ? What if instead of feeding the world , I simply killed hunger ?
" I bet shew was a good kisser , huh ? "
ONE TIME , and I remember this quite clearly , you bet me ten sub sandwiches over something and it was basically pretty clear that you lost .
SYNTAX ERROR FOUND ON LINE 20 : UTAHRAPTOR IS CLEARLY AWESOME
Not only did I get to have FABRICATED MONEY WOES , but I also got to wake up with the same dream - feeling of " aw snap , I'm in trouble now " in real life too . Woo !
It's a still lake at dawn . It's the weekend sun warming your bedsheets . It's Calm . ?
However , I do know what I like ! At present , I like the idea of starting a bluegrass band .
And that's just the motion we know about !
Great - listen , I'm sorry I've been a bit snippy lately ; I've just been a little stressed out about some things at home .
MY GOD
Well , I WAS going to propose a FIGHT TO THE DEATH with you guys , but you know what ? Now I'm so irritated by all this correcting of my clearly awesome language that instead , I'M GOING HOME .
Hold on , that -
Wow . There is something diabolical about that !
I NEVER SAW A MOTHER SO EXTREME . HAVE YOU ?
But I must point out that the semicolon's purpose is almost IDENTICAL to the period ! Therefore while not the vanilla of the punctuation world , it IS merely the vanilla with mint sprinkles .
Well , I'm perfectly content !
She might have a concussion , but yeah . Still . I blame logs .
Oh , hellow , Dromiceiomimus ! I hear you had a . . . SUPER day today ?
Yeah , because if something important about you is fully determined by your genes , then you never had any control over that , and you're not responsible . You didn't have a choice . On the other hand , if you think babies are born as blank slates , then that's limitless personal freedom , but that has problems too !
Khaaaaaaaaan !
I wanna eat food like three times a day ! !
Even if people don't get that most rare and pleasurable of jokes ( the multilingual pun ) , it still sounds awesome : the pizza resistance ! They probably have pizza guns ! !
Well , if you film the crime and structure the crime's financials appropriately .
I think my head is starting to hurt !
I've never had a nightmare ! Or at least , I've never remembered them and they've never been enough to wake me up , which amounts to pretty much the same thing .
Um - pretty sure there are others !
How AGREEABLE .
I am jealous of physicist RICHARD FEYNMAN .
Let us ! Incidentally , my favourite Salt - N - Pepa song is " Let Us Talk About Sex " .
Attention , world ! It is now LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for me to be wrong !
What's so great about being an adult ?
If only !
I didn't write that !
Even a broken clock is right twice a day ! And it's right even more often if " long - term exposure to particulate air pollution is linked with increased risk of cardiovasc - ular disease " is printed on its face .
Okay , so be awesome today ! Build that robot suit "
But here's me speaking CLAUSSICCE ENGLISSHE : " Let's go see a fantastical image that moves as if alive . . . OVERMORROW . " Overmorrow , babies !
I've been writing a romance novel !
Maybe you don't understand verbs ?
I know , right ? Like , what are they thinking ? What do they want ? Why do they cry so much ?
Watson sighed as Sherlock began deducing his own deduction , deducables deducing deducibly all over his -
And given this assumption , and the assumption that people care about exploring the idea of a soul , we can easily cast ghosts and zombies as the investigation of the soul - having experience that they are . For what are ghosts , but souls without a body ? And what are zombies , but bodies without a soul ?
THIS IS ALL THE THESIS DEFENSE I NEED
Everybody dies !
Alternate history autobio ? I think you've invented a new genre here , T - Rex !
AS SHE IS PLAYED
Today is special because today I'm going to be a lady with poise and grace , who excels at her job and does all that she can to make the world a better place !
Take Wikipedia : how can I get mad at the errors when the articles are being pulled together in like two seconds , which I guess isn't that bad ? And when the page is vandalized to read " butts lol ; ) " , that's just a desperate stalling tactic for more time !
OH SNAP .
Actually , F ? fnir's a dwarf who got turned INTO a dragon , and then he gets killed by Gram , who is a magic sword . Magic swords get names in Norse mythology .
Oh , that's weird . It's disappeared from my back yard , I was hoping maybe you'd borrowed it .
It's my Emergency Resume , used only in situations in which I really really want the job . If it's a regular old job it gets the regular old resume , but if it's a really good job , I bust out the " E . R . "
What the - ? ! That's not what I wanted to dream about at all !
You actually win TWO of them .
SEE T - REX THIS IS WHY I KEEP SAYING YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR BOOKS BEFORE TELLING YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM
THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED IN THESE SITUATIONS
SECONDS LATER . . .
Why visit Australia , when it's closer to visit outer space ?
Then what happens ?
" HORSES VS . TRAINS "
WHO CAN SAY ? All we really know for sure is that it was DEFINITELY an accident .
OKAY FINE BUT IT'S NOT A REAL WORD IT'S NOT A WORD THAT PEOPLE KNOW
It's like normal , but when you die you wake up in a hospital !
It isn't working out !
Knowing my fetish is technically possible only serves to increase my desire to see it happen !
I Know ! Scientists need to look into this ! !
oh nooooooo
TALK ONLY WHEN NO LONGER SAD
RPGs sound like nerd games that nerds play ! With - with nerds !
I'm gonna eat ice cream for every meal ! !
by T - Rex
Wow , a late onset sociopathy is a tragedy to witness .
Good , I guess ? Produced by the combined efforts of hundreds if not thousands of people , all of whom expect a profit ?
That's very apt , T - Rex .
Ha ha !
It does explain why time travel isn't possible ! You can't visit a past or future that doesn't exist !
I'm off to see my friend , the Vice Mayor of Tiny Town himself : Mr . Tusks ! He's a tiny elephant with island dwarfism . It's been too LONG since I've last seen him !
10 : Look at a human's hands . If they have the average amount of digits , it's this many !
And have you ramped any such sick rides off boats ?
What did you think of the wedding , Dromiceiomimus ?
Je suis un dinosaure EXTRAORDINAIRE ! Je suis grand et vert .
Killer story , dude ! CHOICE word structure !
Forsooth , I recall those fair summers by the Hamptonshire . Cheerio !
T - REX , WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND TAUGHT OURSELVES ENGLISH !
Hey , for whom does that bell toll ?
Well , instead of saying " I just ate less " , why not say " while portion control remains the most important part of weight loss , healthier choices and an active lifestyle all contribute towards positive changes in our lives " ?
I cleaned the chicken sauce off my face really well !
Sure ! Fine !
You've outdone yourself this time , my friend !
HOW TO KISS
Yes ! THAT IS WHY IT'S HILARIOUS ! !
This is great ! I intend to make all sorts of pronouncements about myself , pronouncements that people will be forced to accept , because who would know myself better than me ? Nobody , that's who !
Wow ! Never has a single sentence made me want to run and hide from its speaker more than right now , in this very moment ! !
Come on ! It Will Be Awesome .
We've probably all been there .
T - Rex , listen : I don't want to live in your new utopia .
I know ! Thank -
How
. . . The Relationship !
T - Rex , where the heck have you been ? !
Hello ? ! Obviously I found a way to combing all three !
Sure it is ! If you're hung up about consciousness , consider it to be emergent behavior !
SERIOUSLY , right ? ?
Perfect .
Hooray for archaeologists !
What a beautiful summer's day ! A good day for me to PARTY DOWN and shout " Wooooooo ! " , I think !
We'd all be a heck of a lot more productive if work was as entertaining as - you know , entertainment ! In particular , I'd be a lot better off if learning accounting was as relentlessly entertaining as learning , I don't know . . .
Sure is !
So excellent , in fact , that I will stomp on this house .
Seven minutes have passed .
THEY JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU SAW THE TV SPOTS GOING
Both mind AND eyes ?
With that sentence , yes .
Woah
WE CLEARLY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE LIVING LIQUID METAL ROBOTS IN ALL MOVIES NOW .
Later , at the farm . . .
Now , if you'll excuse me , I'M going to change all our tomorrows . Farewell !
Oh well ! !
Let's do our friggin' TAXES !
I've decided that if I ever get to travel back in time , AGAIN , I'm going to the Battle of Salamis , in which the Greeks beat the Persians , turning the tide in their war which led tot he eventual Greek victory !
What ? That was perfect !
I've got my own problems !
Any song can have its lyrics replaced with variations on the word " chimichangas " !
All the time !
Let's play 20 questions , Utahraptor !
It totally did ! You were all " what if a relationship is like a real ship " but then Dromiceiomimus was like , " Even the greatest ship crewed by legends can find itself wrecked on the shoals of an unfriendly shore . "
ME .
But then I'd have to live out in the boonies all by myself !
And I can't believe how awesome it is !
ON A TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT I AM :
It's one of the reasons we're friends !
NO REGRETS , UTAHRAPTOR
UNLIKELY
I always forget the TRAGICALLY LIMITED WAY in which straight guys experience professional athletics ! !
I thought we'd agreed - on your urging , actually - that we'd all be saying " bitches " less .
Not to mention the many stunning parks of natural beauty , populated by unique , rare and tasty animals !
FINE . I'll try another tact !
Being rejected by someone can be very upsetting , but I'd much rather gender that reaction to imply that fully half the population is , quite frankly , ridiculously mentally unstable .
Then why do we have a justice system at all ? Just punch someone , check your wallet , and lock 'em up if you're way richer now .
Dear , when you smile at me ,
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TO EAT
Down with money !
If you go for too long , it COULD end up being a snoregy !
Why I want to go into space , an essay by me , T - Rex !
Raising one eyebrow !
Where are the leaves ?
MAYBE YOU MISSED IT
Dromiceiomimus , don't go to the bathroom ! Star Trek is fighting Star Wars in there .
Um , I would prefer it if everything was comfortable now ?
Awwww , T - Rex ! Can't you just use a human trap instead of killing him ?
The first place to check is the last place anyone reported seeing her !
Hello and welcome to Let's Make Another Food ! Today we'll be making " apple pie from scratch " .
T - REX HAVE YOU MET MY BROTHERS FOD AND HOD
" And in April , your 'Kissing Fever' lasted five days before it finally broke . "
I'm sorry about your mug , but things happen for a reason , T - Rex !
Have you got an inbox full of emails , each demanding a response ? Do you feel like " inbox zero " is but a drug - fuelled fantasy ? ? ARE YOU WHISPERING THE WORD " YES " RIGHT NOW ? ?
And Watson's like , " I write stories about my friend " and Robin's all " Well I draw COMICS about mine under a wide variety of pen names " and Watson's surprised at his prolific and varied output and Robin's like " Did you know DC Comics is short for Dick's Crazy Comics " and Watson's like , " I didn't know that , no . "
I call them " H . A . T . S . " , Dromiceiomimus , short for " Head Armour Technology " ! They not only protect you from the ACTUAL RADIATION spewing out from the sun , but some can be " hardened " to protect from even a falling hammer ! I call them , " Hard H . A . T . S " .
IT'S QUANTUM EROTICA O'CLOCK
I'm wacky ! I'm ultra wacky .
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -
I'm PERFECTLY CONTENT if nobody ever talks about T - Rex's Argument Against Time Travel . It's the idea that's important , not who gets credit for it !
I'm sorry but the vice mayor is out on a SMALL errand . Would you like to leave a message ?
When someone gives you a gift it's nice because they're nice to you , but it sucks because suddenly your reactions are
" I banish you to Mike's mom's house at 34 Hell Road , Hellsville , " they say .
T - Rex , you are confusing yourself with a Bill Murray character again .
sex
Hey everyone ! Stop saying " bitches " so much
Bats are nocturnal mammals who can hang upside down while resting .
Your friends are losers , tell them to stop bothering me !
What did you have in mind ?
IF YOU MESS UP AGAIN PEOPLE WON'T THINK YOU'RE GOOD AT TALKING ANYMORE
For example , Dromiceiomimus , if YOU had a son , a great name for him would be DromiceioHEmus . Eh ? . . . Since he's a man , I thought we should emphasize that in his name .
A blacksmith hammered and fused a gorgeous gam out of iron rods .
I'm sure if you were meant to know about fatalism , you'd find out about it eventually . In any case , fatalism is the belief that future events are predetermined for the whole of time and are entirely unalterable !
THIS COMIC IS DEDICATED TO ONE IN SEVEN CANADIANS
COMICS THAT END IN " OH SHIIII - "
They are aware of every lie we've ever told , and so they're super cheezed at being lied to : hence the smashed up plates and whatnot .
There's been times when my friends have TRIED to get me drunk , but they either run out of money or get drunk enough themselves that they forget about the experiment before I'm super sloppy . The end !
You mean in terms of protection against disease , or in terms of adjusting your taste ?
Farmer's call them nature's dominoes !
AHHHH !
You know it , baby !
You're not impressing anyone , T - Rex !
Ok , MAYBE I WILL go to Japan . Screw you guys .
ONE .
T - REX'S BEST NIGHT EVER T - REX'S PLACE 9 : 00 PM
THIS HAS BEEN
Pretty NEAT ! ?
MID - AFTERNOON :
I'm opening up my own detective agency !
( Here you are outlining her figure with your hands , or your head has turned into a cartoon steamwhistle and your tongue is lolling out while you say " awoooka " )
ALSO HORSES HAVE THE BIGGEST EYES OF ANY LAND MAMMAL !
That list isn't that helpful , T - Rex ! Finding a new sweetie is more than actually meeting them : you have to talk to them , discover shared interests and interesting differences , explore your compatibility , and so on !
Yeah man ! And YOUR brain writes these little stories where you're the greatest guy ever , and then shares its author - insertion Mary Sue fics with itself , and THEN , congratulates itself on such an enjoyable , compelling narrative !
These are deep religious questions , my friend . QUESTION A : is there an afterlife ? QUESTION B : If so , is there a level cap on XP ?
T - REX IN : ONE FROGGY EVENING
I already know how it is !
Are you going to try mind - altering drugs because of peer pressure ?
AHHHHHH I CAN'T EVEN DEAL
Normally the saying is only applied to BAD things , T - Rex !
There were some dead moths in my cereal this morning , and I'm hoping there's some way I can turn this into a positive event .
Our industry IS causing global climate change !
I don't get that many emails anymore !
THE AREA UNDER A STAIR IS KNOWN AS A SPANDREL
Unlike THEM , we seek a true interpersonal connection ! !
Maybe we should be more sensitive here , T - Rex !
I thought you always liked street art , T - Rex ! You're always all , " Hey guys , let's reclaim public spaces with art instead of ads ! "
" FRIENDLY GOOD TIMES "
They returned ever night to haunt her for years !
YESSSSS
Come on , that's dumb !
He notices it every time we walk outside his door , wherever THAT is . " Hello ! " he says , his arms open wide . I don't think we've ever heard him though . It's probably for the best !
Change your language !
Dude , I know what songs are .
nobody calls me chicken
Okay , you've earned this one , my friend ! What kind of cat keeps your grass short ? A lawn MEOWer !
HOW TO SUCCEED AT SMALL TALK
Then we thought they did it because they didn't have enough saliva and therefore liked their food pre - moistened !
T - Rex , when you became my roommate we agreed that our lives would not turn into a sitcom .
COMICS IN WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS TIRED OF PUNS AND SO EVERYBODY DIES
What I'll remember best about my night with the Dromiceiomimus could only be one thing . . .
My friend , you have to be WACKY to go on a wacky adventure
That was easy !
I'd love to go back in time and tell him " Hey man - of everyone here , you were the most right . " Actually - I think I'd mostly just like to hear that myself .
That is the plan !
and I'M christopher marlowe !
I HAVE LONG SINCE STOPPED SOLICITING SUGGESTIONS , UTAHRAPTOR .
Really ? Sweet !
* sigh * Reality is so wonderful sometimes .
Always up to my old tricks !
. . . and that's how it went down .
Push him ! Dude deserves it ! !
. . . right now !
Have all my years of sleepy shame been for naught ?
If it's an egg laid BY a chicken , then by definition the chicken came first . But if it's an egg that will hatch INTO a chicken , then that can easily be laid by a non - chicken , so eggs win again ! EVOLUTION , BABY .
WELL TOO BAD FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S
Dromiceiomimus , here's a funny joke . A skeleton walks into a bar and orders a drink and a mop !
Arguing with God again , T - Rex ?
Because Utahraptor , it means that today is the first time in history , in ALL OF EXISTENCE , that a dinosaur - me ! - did anything from the exact location in the universe that we're at right now !
Huh ? Oh ! Um , I think burning fresh sage is supposed to work ?
Maybe they don't do this because - stay with me - ghosts don't exist ?
Um , Hamlet doesn't actually end like that , T - Rex .
Please ? Pleeeease tell me what you did that was so stupid ?
What the hell was he talking about ? I've got the insurance papers right here !
NEGOTIATING
I think you mean " prejudice " . And what about diaries , amateur writings , transcriptions of dialogue , writing under duress . . . ?
I want robot cars !
And luckily for me , these rules clearly stipulate that I can stomp on whatever I want !
I've been taking cold showers almost everyday !
Ah , but I was referring to the sport of CHESS .
It's a long password but it's gonna pay off ! In dollars ! !
Here are some free rap lyrics for anyone who wants to put them into a song and then make me a rap song millionaire . You should probably definitely do this !
That's not a real song though !
Needless to say , this was super surprising for the astronauts !
I'll tell you what we DO have : a website you can write " FAIL " on top of other people having a hard time !
Well , with God on the case , it will be returned for sure ! One giant hand reaching down from the sky , with bike , coming up !
You don't know your own word ?
Dromiceiomimus , how did you know ? ?
Conclusion : my thesis statement is correct ! Everyone loves robots and everyone is totally bored whenever they hear about horses with souls that talk about feelings . BORING feelings .
We lose ! We're fighting AGELESS COMBAT - TRAINED VAMPIRES , yo .
You must admit that it makes the whole debate a lot more interesting .
And with that I'm off to go have a bath or something .
Hi we're T - Rex and Utahraptor and we'll be performing " Push It " by Salt - N - Pepa in the original French .
Okay , so you grow up in the city , and the skyline is dominated by billboards , ads for products and brand you don't have access to . And you realize that nobody cares you you are , but EVERYONE knows who Mickey Mouse is and what a Coke is . So you create a brand name for yourself ! You make up a tag and put it everywhere .
A flapper has some dresses : five times as many awesome ones as she has rad dresses , and fifteen sweet dresses for every awesome dress . How many nice dresses does she have ? ?
Good answer , Dromiceiomimus ! I award you . . . TEN POINTS .
. . . And maybe that should change ? ?
Frig , it's actually Tuesday ! !
Some words are shorthand for longer words or phrases that we no longer use .
As you know , there was in fact a real Confucius . He lived in the 5th century in Ancient China ( then called " China " ) and was and is an incredibly well - respected philosopher !
It's called " On the menu : Sexy stories for People with Problems " and in all the stories the sex gets derailed because the people are worried about their Problems . The cover looks like a menu because it ties in well with the title . Now , if you'll allow me to continue ?
I'm cold - blooded ! Check it and see .
Patrick Stewart ! What are you doing here ?
Not necessarily T - Rex !
Do you ever wonder if computers are the ones training us to do their reading for them , for when the robot revolution comes ? Like , perhaps the Earth will be coated with a haze that distorts letters in a weird and bendy way and they'll need us to read their refueling instructions ?
It's so stressful
And while they were flying , his dad warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun , because the wax in his wings would melt and he'd fall to his death ! Icarus said " Frig , is this symbolic of how we mortals should not aspire to usurp the power of the Gods ? Is this an allegory showing the limits and folly of earthly invention ? Because we just invented heavier - than - air flight out of WAX and FEATHERS , Dad . I think maybe the Gods won't mind . "
And you had to print it out yourself ? ?
Indeed we would . . . Indeed we would .
That was me !
AHHHHHHHHHHH it's SO GOOD
And you can't turn it off . It's like a phone that won't stop ringing whenever I'm hurt , and when I answer it , it's always friggin' Pain calling and he won't get off the line . I say " Yeah , I get it Pain , I stubbed my toe . " and he says " Yeah , it still hurts like a bitch . Can I say bitch ? It really hurts , T - Rex " , and I say " Look , Pain . I know . " and he stays on the line and I say " Pain , you've gotta find other people to call . You've got to get other hobbies . "
They love 'em !
It's true , everyone !
Dude , are you being mammals racist ?
He doesn't do that anymore !
I call shenanigans !
Maybe it's the cereal .
Every second I'm not playing this game is a second I WILL LITERALLY REGRET ON MY DEATH BED , AHHHHHHHHH
The acid combined with the exotic metal of the typewriter to produce a strange gas which -
SEVERAL DAYS LATER !
Geez .
I wouldn't mind so much , but it makes me feel so old !
Um , sorry we didn't build them better ? ?
Sure they can , T - Rex ! You see new things , and there's danger .
Why involve FALLIBLE TALKING MEAT when we have robots , programmed to be infallible , and also not to be meat ?
Wait , Utahraptor totally made up " Idis A . Greeh " to prove his point !
But that doesn't make me a terrible person , right ? We're judging the past by the standard of the present .
oh , give me a BREAK !
IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON ANOTHER DATE
Yayyyyy
So you're saying that when she was born , her parents , MR . AND MRS . NATRIX , named their new baby " Dommi " .
Well ? Do you like it ?
That is true !
That's so annoying !
Don't die on me , Sir .
Hey ! Don't try to trick me .
You gotta set the mood , my friend ! We need anticipation !
Sometimes , I guess !
Hmm ! That's pretty similar to question 7 , actually
( GROSS . )
HOWEVER IT HAS RECEIVED NEAR UNIVERSAL PRAISE IN THE GAMING PRESS
You know what ? It's still egotistical , and if you've succeeded at everything you've tried , you're not trying hard enough things . Here , here's something to try : why don't you cure cancer ? And hey , why not come up with a clean , safe , cheap , efficient , powerful , renewable AND reliable energy source while you're at it ?
That only works if there's a forecaster monoculture ! But I see where you're going with this , Utahraptor , and I agree :
URBAN LEGEND COMICS
FRIGGIN' GARDENS OF REGRET ! !
Indeed ! !
And , as this pinnacle of evolution , YOU ARE HONESTLY WORRYING ABOUT YOUR " PERSONAL BRAND " . This friendship is OVER .
Happy ? I'm going to find someone and we're going to get married and it's going to take two weeks . Okay ?
And I'm TIRED of God offering to create new vegetables for me .
Ah . So Earth truly was covered in microscopic " dust mites " feeding on the flaked off - skin you left behind everywhere you went , and there wasn't a single place on the planet that wasn't infested by them .
Well I don't judge , but you should hear it from a friend first : you're going to write a sex scene soon .
I would think that they are hot !
I find myself compelled to disagree !
I felt embarrassed , and soon found myself imagining different conversations I could've had instead .
You know what I'm tired of feeling ?
The odds are that SOMEONE I know will be a victim of theft or crime or an accident or even violence , and that sucks , because there's basically nothing I can do to stop it !
Dude ! I've always been into hearing !
Oceans appear and disappear in a single generation ! Continents collide and divide within living memory ! International relations are much more complicated , given this new reality of constantly - shifting natural borders . Land disappears into the earth's core so fast you can almost watch it happen .
Wouldn't you love to be able to imagine every stranger of a certain age as your child ? Utahraptor , it's a guaranteed sense of wonder for the rest of your life !
You're done shooting aliens and they are all dead . It's cool though . You call up your sweetie and apologize for things you've done wrong in the past , and promise to do better in the future . You tell her you love her . You mean it in a way you haven't meant it for years . All your relationship problems are solved !
You're just trying to scare me !
One day Earth is attacked by aliens !
This was before mass media , so when the dance was altered , catchy idiom was used to popularize the change !
There's so many bad everythings !
Our generation's greatest TERRIBLE RACIST may also do the same thing though .
More importantly , do even they have spiritual lives that correspond with the church you're building ?
Poltergeists !
And then you thought how prejudiced that was ?
Just figuring this out now ?
LATER , T - REX LEAVES A VOICEMAIL FOR THE PERSON WHO CORRECTED HIM :
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE T - REX YOU KNOW WHAT JUST USE RUTH
There's nothing like a Twitter post that says " Definitely not planniny any crimes ever ! # seriouslyyouguys "
So what happens next , mysterious stranger ? We still really want to hear more !
The result will be a game to RUIN LIVES !
T - REX DID YOU HEAR ARCHIE IS GETTING MARRIED
Yeah , this is even worse than a break - up email ! You have to at least compose an email .
Dreams are crazy
" Harley Quinn , " he continued , " sounds like 'harlequin' which matches her clown theme , but is based on her ACTUALLY GIVEN AT BIRTH real name , 'Harleen Quinzel' . " He signed . " After a certain number of these - " he brooded , then stopped , suddenly fully alert up at his bat computer .
If you've only got a few hours to live , then YOU , Utahraptor , are a bird with nothing left to lose . Holy Crap . You know those religions where you come back as different animals ?
But there's no cure for cancer !
So ! Since the Universe is TOTALLY MEANINGLESS , looking for any sort of meaning in life is absurd , and we're all sorta stuck . But lucky for us , the absurdist philosophers came up with three ways to resolve this ! The - the first resolution is suicide .
T - Rex , this is BORING . Let's talk about something interesting , like the vacuum robot I bought !
Some folks got opinions , you guys !
No , no , we're into it !
Hooray ! Friends again !
You and whoever is reading this should probably make out ! !
Aww ! I agree !
HEY GUESS WHO'S NOT A GREEK GOD
Yaaaaaay
They're all drenched , lost in sorrow - a new kind of sorrow , a grief , a sadness so intense it could smother them . Dripping wet , staring at the ground , they weep . Eventually Jenn looks up and smiles as best she can , bravely , but it's so small , so fragile . She turns and walks away , her broken balloon dragging behind her .
. . . history ?
Thank you Dromiceiomimus . Utahraptor ?
daaaang , trex , I told you you'd lose that thing if you weren't diligent .
Nopers !
While technically true , T - Rex , the awards are for Americans only , and most of the prizes are for reporting .
I would , and did ! !
SEXISTS
But NOW's the age when we get it all right ? Ridic . There's gotta be junk WE think is accurate but future peeps will mock us for ! Put another way : OUR science says hoverboards are impossible . Would YOU rather be wrong with a hoverboard or right without one ?
" TROUBLE AT HOME ? "
What about the time you built the Riverboat Shabby , T - Rex ?
But that's not what I wanted to talk about . I wanted to talk about how one bad decision can totally change your life , you know ? Lost limbs , broken friendships , unexpected pregnancies with someone you don't really like : stuff like that .
I've got a question : who the hell goes to Cornwall ?
No no , I meant , " This is hilarious because he's vegan ? "
" To date , that's definitely the best baby I'VE ever seen ! "
Yeah , but some kids always team up and save Christmas ! You really need to finish watching the holiday specials you start , T - Rex .
Oh my goodness I just figured out what I was meant to do with my life . I have discovered my CALLING .
As Vice Mayor , it is my privilege to assume office when the mayer is out of towne on municipal business !
I , in particular , sincerely enjoy tasty things .
If you're going to impress by making predictions about the immediate future you should do so early on ! They may become increasingly inaccurate .
And it turns out there's all these children around named after me too ? ?
YUP
Is it possible to have adventures in today's modern world ? I mean real adventures , like ones where I get to swashbuckle .
Why would you even say that ? ! I'm the only one that can hear you !
But do you really want a world where people hasten to clarify their metaphors and linguistic flourishes ?
CLASSICS OF WESTERN LITERATURE COMICS
Okay okay so - am I making the best use of my time ? Judging by the success of others the answer may well be , in fact , " PERHAPS NOT " .
zero zero six !
LATER , HATERS
I said this database was bad news , T - Rex !
If Two accepts , they both take their money and go their separate ways . But if Two rejects , NOBODY gets any money . And the game is played only once , so there's no worry about reprisals .
In truth , I had only the loosest grasp on female anatomy , but I'd take that secret to my grave .
Beneath an " I'M WITH STUPID " shirt , wear another one that says " NO , NOT REALLY " .
Avoid it , dude !
Sunsets can be inspiring in you are a sensitive dude , or a super weepy dude .
T - REX YOUR NEW NICKNAME IS GINGER PEANUT
Chilling out , maxing , relaxi -
Judging by this well - conditioned body - including thighs - and coupled with what I feel intuitively to be an impressive intellect , I can be one thing and one thing alone !
FUCK homecare !
INCORRECT HOMOPHONE COMICS
THANK you !
TODAY IS LABOUR DAY ( LABOR DAY IN THE UNITED STATES ) AND SHE STOOD ME UP AGAIN .
also the cop is a DINOSAUR we should have put that on the TOP of the POSTER
While Ivy was giving everyone on Earth a second chance , Batman was punching a murder clown .
Today's origin story : GREEN LANTERN
Woohoo ! This promises to be the best weekend ever in the hisotry of time !
. . . is REVENGE .
Damn you , Opportunistic real estate agency ! !
We are surrounded by computers , so we should probably know something about them , huh ? ?
Watch this !
He is a ghost who eats our food . He doesn't even need to !
Yep ! Stands for " I Miss My Old Girlfriend , But Not Really " Used all the time
She knew a way to do that ! !
The expression's " knock yourself out ! "
i guess i'm probably off your christmas card list this year , huh t - rex
IT HELPS
I thought we covered this before , T - Rex ? Your will isn't necessarily legally binding .
The downside is it's hard to control external variables , so the experiments repeat quite often . But that's good for us , because it just means more science !
Garbagemen become garbagefighters . Waitresses become waitfighters which is what they do in ideal situations ! If someone insists on calling you a " male nurse " , gently correct them and say the preferred term is " fight nurse " .
Man , shovelling snow is for chumps ! I truly wish I had a snowplow .
When my explosion - centric disaster movie comes out and people want more , I will say to them , " No , ACTUALLY , you want the same thing , but this time , as a gross - out comedy ! "
Huh - not bad , actually ! Do me .
" We do , " said Apple . " At least the ones called to the Bar . "
There are other words than " bitches " ! Daaamn !
< < pew pew > >
Please , Dromiceiomimus , I'm a scientist .
Now , where is my wallet ?
" But , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east , and Plagiarism is the sun " ?
SLANG FOR TEENS
If you're serious about this , T - Rex , then listen very closely : I need you to start checking your watch twice . It's nothing when you're awake , but in dreams , the numbers will usually be wildly different the second time . It only works with digital watches , but it may be the ONLY clue that you're dreaming . Remember , T - Rex ! CHECK YOU WATCH TWI -
Sure have ! !
You should try relaxing with a margarita . It's the official drink of chill people !
and
Time to educate my peers . . . through the medium of incredibly true facts !
And let's say I , oh , I don't know , SLIPPED UP AND GOT CAUGHT ? ?
Divorce ?

Robyn bought a camera from an eerie second - hand store . The storekeeper wore strange , old - fashioned clothes and spoke in an unfamiliar accent . When Robyn returned the next day , the store was AN EMPTY LOT , ABANDONED FOR YEARS !
Utahraptor , I appreciate what you're doing !
OH MY GOSH ARE YOU ART PERSONIFIED , THE VERY ESSENCE OF PAINTINGS , SCULPTURE , AND MUSIC GIVEN FORM ? ?
It's a tricky power to have !
" Baby , " he replied , " it's also because I am sexy and loveable and smart and manly and sexy . " She was nodding . He paused , looked around , and then whispered , " I put 'sexy' in twice because I'm - " " - twice as sexy " she whispered back , the two of them whispering it together . She knew that he was twice as sexy as a regular sexy man . That was probably a good thing for their relationship , he decided . Better that she know now , than be suprised down the road !
. . . Normally at this point you'd talk about the science behind the experiment , T - Rex .
NOT WHAT I MEANT .
I wanted to be the guy that swerved
Hmm . . . what's the biggest mistake I've ever made , I wonder ?
based on a true story
Are you ASHAMED of us , T - Rex ?
Come on , society doesn't make us all suicidal ! It only makes a FEW people suicidal .
Not only does it allow excellent names to be redistributed to new children , but as we have more kids we'll catch up , and eventually one will be named after my wife ! It evens out ! Everybody wins !
But , being really cool IS one of the perks of being a computer scientist !
GUYS
You're going to sneeze !
I had a crazy dream once !
T - REX PUTS UP POSTERS AROUND TOWN AND THEY GET COVERED WITH ADS FOR YOGA SCHOOLS :
" Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains - a pretty violent image there ! I think if you've got a T - shirt with a bloodstain all over it . . . "
I would say you're crazy , because WHERE ARE THE HOVERCARS ?
I cannot , for now I work as a bouncer and stomping on unruly customers is part of my job !
MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD TELL THEM THAT , HUH ? ?
So he duplicated her chemicals and then he could control plants too , and he also got her immunity to all toxins and poisons which was also great . Plant Batman was even more effective at stopping crime than Regular Batman ! Even Alfred was like " Dang , plants would help me be a better butler " and became Plant Alfred , using plants to deliver snacks to Batman in the field .
Lolita , light of my life ! Fire of my loins ! My sin , my soul !
I know you probably didn't choose it , but still . Your name .
Unless your name is " Muscles X . Houseblaster " you can come up with WAY better branding than your friggin' name . I'm gonna be a real - estate agent and I'm gonna show ya'll how it's done .
SO HOT
How come this sort of stuff happens to you , T - Rex ?
Also ! !
That will be my epitaph , then !
SONGS IN LIMERICK FORM COMICS
They're always arguing !
In summary , any event in which I was embarrassed is now non - canon !
It was then that the first spaceship landed .
It lacks continuity !
" PO OP "
Yeah , but it's Rosencratz and Guildenstern , right ? I've got my own life , but it only counts when I'm around the main character . Everything else is forgotten !
Nothing travels faster than light , right ? What little gravitational attraction there is between us is time - delayed too .
Because - kids can read them ? I guess ?
What is left for me to do ? I am king of all that I survey ! I am the dominant creature on the planet !
Dude , your ideas , they're - -
And we're ALL pooched !
I was told that " someone of my * ahem * 'stature' didn't belong under stage lights " . For crying out loud !
And ghosts hanging around from hundreds of years ago ?
Ah , but this electronic communication can take away from face - to - face interaction !
ONE DAY LATER :
Yeah ! By being a cop , you'd automatically see people who require the services of cops way more often than those who don't . You're blasting your data set the same way that folks who see well publicized reports about " Pedophiles ! On the INTERNET ! ! " do when they conclude that everyone online is big into kids .
I did ! Quite successfully , obvs !
Choo !
T - Rex , these can be treated with surgery , and many don't even need treatment !
Dude , I'm gonna ! I'm gonna go get in line for some punch RIGHT NOW !
Those are terrible names ! Those are names you give to cats that you don't like .
" DID YOU KNOW : This Song Cures All Diseases ( The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song ) "
Who's going to stop me ? ?
I wonder what someone studying my life for a FUTURE BIOGRAPHY would think about me . What does it mean that I spend so much time doing the things I do ?
I'm talking " How To Stop Peeing Yourself On Public Transit For Dummies " embarrassing !
Well , here's the new normal : your friends are going to talk about babies for the next several years . Are you interested in babies ? If yes , terrific ! If no , however , you'd better start learning how to pretend .
Utahraptor , please !
Well ! SO MUCH FOR THAT LITTLE SHORTCUT .
I can steal your goggles , Space Rex !
Something that was very special ! Something that I guess part of me thought I'd always have with me ! Something that I'd tried to hold on to , but lost nonetheless !
Yes ! I am !
On the flipside , digging a ditch is pretty easy , but nobody's THAT impressed when you tell them you can dig a long hole . But I think it's naive to assume that the amount of time it takes to learn a job is equivalent to the prestige it brings !
I'm not convinced that such small events can have that large an impact !
Love and sexual pleasure are just nature's way of getting us to * want * to reproduce !
Another day lived to the MAX ?
If they were , we'd all be at EQUAL popularity , and popularity becomes meaningless ! We need folks like you for our popularity to even be a thing .
It's been warm and then hot and then uncomfortably hot and then warm again , which suggests to me that
Hi T - Rex , what's new ?
MY APOCALYPTIC TENOR HAS NOT BEEN DISPELLED !
So ! What do you think of my final slogan ?
I get the sense you empathize with these ghosts a lot .
His best friend is Clark Ent ! They haven't done THAT before . " Clark Ent . "
Earlier that day
Dromiceiomimus , did you know that Latin women are passionate and fiery ?
Um , I'm just a telemarketer who wants to sell you some long distance ?
Aww , I'm sorry , T - Rex ! But how do you know it's discrimination ?
- mix of " Layla " and " Smells like Teen Spirit " into one song . So everyone can listen to both of my favourite songs at the same time !
And believe me , he's involved with some very sexy women ! It's always the same : at first they're friends , but he wants more . She sense this and tries to let him down easy , but he's so into the diea of her that he's certain her hints actually show interest . Anyway he gets weird and passive aggressive and it screws up the friendship .
as arranged by increasing hotness
Utahraptor , once I Realized sports is just a computational challenge waiting to be solved , I've been watching 'em on the regular to tweak my algorithm ! But it hasn't stopped there ! I even want to . . . DO a sport ? ?

Sure ! But I'm GUARANTEED that 50 % win !
CASE 1023
FINE WHICH WORD IN CURRENT USAGE HAS THE MOST -
Aw , T - Rex , you'd be one of those guys with deliberate facial hair ?
SENTENCES THAT ARE NEVER GOOD TO HEAR
It's okay ! It only made them better ! Check it out :
Hah ! I would say that I might have a touch of Cloonacy ! !
This may be an inopportune time to mention it but I consider him to be a TOTAL DICK
Okay okay - time to solve ALL the problems .
And the only way out ?
GREETINGS T - REX ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH SPEED RUNS
Do you get to write your own epitaph ? If you do , then mine will seriously be " Here lies T - Rex : the radical dude with the radical 'tude ! " Or even * T - Rex : smart and trim ; let's be like him " !
Oh , I've got other awful ideas too ! Like , a toy gun for children , but every one in twenty shots ( on average ) it actually fires a real bullet !
3 . 8 billion years ago evolution was all , " I got this " . And then it whips out simple cells and multicellular life and friggin' PHOTOSYNTHESIS , and then tasty treats in the water and air and land , and plants and fish and reptiles and mammals and birds and flowers and finally us : FULLY SENTIENT LADIES AND DUDES . And then , THEN , evolution says , " Phew , I'm plumb tuckered out ! "
Is that racist ? ?
Like this one time , I had to pay my phone bill , but it's sort of a pain to mail stuff , you know ? So I just waited and waited and eventually a collections agency called ME , and they let me pay my bill over the phone !
Now imagine actually being that - I'll say it - OLD . Crazy , isn't it ? The idea of living life at such an age , knowing each day that you're just getting older still . Imagine what your life would be like then , some of your friends gone , others changed almost beyond recognition . You don't keep in touch with them all anymore , obviously . Well , anyway : good news ! You're already half - way there !
Wait . Huh ?
Party on , Bill !
That is my EMAIL SIGNATURE and it's AMAZING and you are not allowed to STEAL IT

Imperfect songs do , yeah ! Perfect ones , not so much .
Why not ? Why not ? I'll tell you why not ! !
Can they at least be dogs ?
No , I - I was talking to the Devil . He's concerned that casual gaming could eclipse the parts of the market he identifies with .
My stars , do I ever love documentary films . The best form of filmmaking ?
Is there any of the old her left inside that shambling horror ? ?
I've NEVER been more intrigued !
EPILOGUE : YEARS LATER , T - REX IS MOSTLY REMEMBERED FOR THE ONE TIME HE SAID " WHICH ONE OF YOU JERKS POURED A COFFEE IN MY HAT ? "
A few months later :
So if we look at PREVIOUS bestselling books maybe we can figure out what good titles are ! I did some very basic research and it turns out the all - time bestselling books include " A Tale of Two Cities " , " The Lord of the Rings " , and " The Little Prince " .

My apologies .
Oh wait , hah hah , a hardware failure was causing all that reindexing churn and once I swapped out the bad disk and rebuilt the array it stopped and we're good now !
Get it , Dromiceiomimus ? It's like the HTTP error code . 404 : not found !
YOU ARE GREAT
Squid cuttlefish , and other similarly baleful creatures are all members of the cephalopod family , characterized by HUGE EYS , BEAKS , INTELLIGENCE , and AMBITION .
It's time for us to make friends with some pool - owning dudes ! !
" UPDATE bodies SET status = ' DEAD ' " !
There are still some other alternatives you haven't considered , T - Rex !
Here's a story ! I moved away from my creepy raccoon and cephalopod neighbours , but they moved next door to my new place anyway . The moral of the story is , " You can't run away from your friggin' problems " !
Hah ! Whoops !
But what about Robo - horse meets Cyberhorse , Robohorse and the Chamber of Secrets , and King's Quest Horse ?
Well , I'm not sure if -
Next up : this national animal eats hay , has four legs , and symbolizes freedom and adventure !

Hey , I wonder if I got any emails while I was out ?
As we all know , Spider - Man is a fake man who does not exist !
I'm going to get thoughtful experiential gifts , Dromiceiomimus ! I'm going to examine your entire life and decide what one , singular experience your life has been leading to that you've not yet accomplished , and then , I'm going to provide you with that experience ! Doesn't that sound -
Dromiceiomimus , we live in a place and time that insists summer can't last forever , and to that I say : FRIG THAT .
Thanks , friend !
Ouch !
Anyway whatever , SPOILER ALERT , here they are !
I'd prefer looking down and seeing that my toe is stubbed to , um , EXCRUCIATING PAIN .
Dear God , if I have to die , please let it be doing this
Dromiceiomimus ! Which creature goes on four feet in the morning , two feet at noon , and three feet in the evening ?
There's PICTURES ! !
On second thought ERASE ALL THAT , and I instead would like to say :
And yet , I still feel like I've discovered the ability to summon Beetlejuice !
AND I WILL MAKE YOU GOOD AT IDIOM
Jay wished for all the powers of Superman ! Golden - age , specifically .
I . . . guess not ? That IS what you did with Don Kikong .
But these ideas won't be scary for passers - by !
Now all the pretty girls will want to dance with me for sure !
Yes . Then she uploads her mind into a computer so she can win on Jeopardy .
God ! Did you PRETEND to be Shakespeare ?
Here is a list of things that were once totally cool and remain so :
Haha , YEP ! It's so awesome .
Ooooh man !
And " some of your best friends are raccoons and cephalopods " , right ?
" But it's still an awesome story so I'm glad I did . " " Also this saves someone , perhaps my best friend T - Rex , from now having to actually write it . " " Yaaay . "
Oh but if you try to spell a proper name you get SHOT the fuck DOWN !
You heard right , my friend !
T - Rex , do you ever feel like people expect too much from you and you're really a giant fraud ?
Once upon a time , there was a man who ate his hat !
Okay when you've done that turn to panel 4 !
The problem is , it's TOO good of an idea !
Where are you going to find a mud puddle so deep that you can go over your head on ACCIDENT ? And even if you DID , any sand dense enough to prevent you from swimming out would be dense enough to make you float . You'd sink only until you displaced enough sand to make you buoyant , and then it's smooth sailing !
What ? Dude it's been so long since I've seen the ocean .
Man , you're always screwing those two up ! !
I don't know if these really count as ethnic food .
Riveting !
Okay , so whatever . MAYBE the Terminal Velocity Skateboard Simulator would never reach terminal velocity , since there's no wind resistance . But do we not have an obligation to future generations to make sure ? ?
Y - you're not -
If only there were some way that I could come back to now . . . some way I could save this world to peek in once in a while .
And while the older generation will think it's rude to pay attention to brain computers while talking to someone else , the younger generation will do the opposite and automate most conversations .
REALITY INTRUDES
Does anybody else want Mexican food for dinner ? Like - always ? Like 24 hours a day I would eat Mexican food if it were physically possible ?
Maybe if you had more twin brothers ?

CONVERSATIONAL TECHNIQUES COMICS today's technique : " I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS "
Oh snap , here come the profits !
That's TOTALLY HIM , Domiceiomimus !
Remember : when drawing your comics , be sure to use all sorts of different shots : close ups , establishing shots , and more . Many beginner cartoonists will find one shot they like and then use it over and over , stopping only when the comic ends .
You're dancing around the REAL threat here , T - Rex : ZOMBIE MOSQUITOES .
AS THE UTAHRAPTOR GIVES HIS SUGGESTION , THE T - REX'S FACE FILLS WITH EXCITEMENT . . .
You ever . . . J . O . in public ? ?

Now for the rest of eternity we can cever say you were first described as an elite professional naturally : you had to ask - beg , really - for it .
The morning dawned bright and clear as the thunder - lizard began his perambulation .
I said , maybe you should stop being such a jerk !
Adults can own grocery stores , but also have to face the long slow of their body , mind and self !

Ladies and gentlemen : I am down with fall !

Darn it ! Is everything we do ultimately reduced to greed ?
With semantic density this low , we must be insane !
Yes ! You certainly are recognizing objects , something most children do in their first few months .
Epitaphs need to grab the attention of passers by , Utahraptor - you're competing with EVERYONE ELSE who's ever died !
Kay then decided to have breakfast : a muffin . It turned out to be the right decision , because just then her fridge exploded and her toaster burst into flame . " Ah , " she realized , " I get it : the way my wish works is rather than making my choices good , it makes my considered but discarded alternatives bad . It's one of those ironic consequences wishes . "
EXISTENTIALIST : Life feeds on life .
Hells yes !
Are you worried that you sound a little creepy ?
Dinosaur Present Day , Featuring T - Rex , has been a complete success !
Now there's baby trafficking involved ! How is that not sadder than previously - loved footwear at an unbeatably low price ? ?
WHAT IS . . . A GLUTEN ?
It hurts !
It's gonna be SUCH an amazing painting , Dromiceiomimus ! I realized the other day that I am a dude with some disposable income , and I could COMMISSION PAINTERS to create works of art for me ! So I'm having a portrait of myself done as if I am a king from olden times , and I'm going to hang it up in my house . And in the background ? HORSES .
Good sir ! I pray that you stop !
In conclusion and in summary , way to go archaeologists !
It's my grandmother's birthday today ! I'M going to call her to wish her happy birthday ! I'm doing this because they don't give those " # 1 Grandson " mugs to just anybody .
But before you do that , T - Rex , you should consider your investment goals !
15 hits ! 15 lives cut so tragically short that the only response left to us is this : a lol , perhaps a rofl .
For instance , Dromiceiomimus , I could ask , " Hey , Dromiceiomimus ! Are you still punching children ? "
Wait , sorry , I meant to say " oh no , how terrible ! "
Did you mean . . . Not on I watch ?
Say there's a survey about applesauce : like most dudes , I don't really have APPLESAUCE OPINIONS , so I'm probably not going to answer a whole survey about it ! But if I were big into applesauce ( or big AGAINST applesauce ) I'd be way more into answering the survey . The result is that surveys overrepresent extreme viewpoints , because the only people completing surveys are those INTERESTED in doing so .
Dismissed !
COMPRESSED THESIS COMICS : today's thesis : " Computational Measures of the Acceptability of Light Verb Constructions "
We need to do some Olympic - class screw ups and feel REALLY bad about them if we're ever going to win .
LATER T - REX IS FORCED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE HORSES FOR " SADDLING " THEM WITH STUPID NAMES :
MEANWHILE , IN DREAMLAND !
COMICS WITH NON - TWIST ENDINGS
But we can't fault him for that , because he also came up with an objective and clearly defined method of accumulating and verifying knowledge whose descendant - the scientific method ! - we're still using today . He also thought that women were a lower form of life , because he found them to be . . . um , physically colder ?
Ah , so WE invented makeouts . Our generation was the first one to come up with them .
Last night I dreamt I had been invited to a fancy party , far away , and the host was nice enough to buy me a plane ticket to get there .
And so modest , too !
Time to STOMP ON THIS HOUSE - Quebec style !
Thanks for reading ! If all went well , you will have spent way too long looking at this image , and are now feeling a little dizzy !

You were supposed to spread the new saying around ! Come on ! !
I didn't have any plutonium though ,
Well . . . that's it !
Camus is dead .
But your " gift " of inner peace comes at the cost of closing your eyes to the world around you !
So you're completely rational about love ? You keep any non - sciency feelings out of it , walking around town saying " this person is acceptable ; I will proceed to love them . Love begins in 3 , 2 , 1 , - now . "
Yep , a book ! It's a proud tradition , long available to writers who just don't have any plots right now !
All I have to do is concentrate , and . . .
If I had lived in the past I'd have different beliefs , because I'd have nobody modern around me to teach me anything else !
And if I died of natural causes , that's _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , but if , as I suspect , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is responsible then I insist they be _ _ _ _ _ _ _ into a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and blasted into _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
Things are alright , T - Rex !
Allusions are pretty handy because they allow you to summarize potentially complex ideas with one succinct reference , essentially piggybacking on the brilliance of previously established works ! HOWEVER , if the audience isn't familiar with the reference , the alluson fails and can seem weird or out - of - place .
Patrons who don't barge into the kitchen ?
I'm SO GLAD we named it Frigday instead of " Friday " !
Oh man , this is just another one of your dumb postal service conspiracy theories ! !
I HEARD YOU HAVING SEX LAST NIGHT

YOU'LL SAY IT IN THE FUTURE
It doesn't work !
I don't mean to brag , I don't mean to boast / but when it comes to exclusive commitment I've got the most !
What's the solution , T - Rex ? A utopian society ?
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
The Emmymatics and the Mathemoscar !
How ?
Maybe you deserve better ? ?
You have trouble processing it as the boat descends towards you , but then - you realize ! It's all an analogy for how you like boring regular music and I'm busy inventing the FUTURE ! !
Um , ABSOLUTELY ?
" These cents are for libraries ! Read a book why don't you ? ? "
The same skin these ghosts now crave !
I don't want to comment on whether or not it was a nice naked crotch ! It was fine . I only looked out of some weird instinct . I think we've all got it .
Well , there's only about 1000 billionaires worldwide .
Wouldn't the very act of sending this card make things weird ?
I LIKE THE MARIO SERIES IN PARTICULAR
Well ! Stomping on this woman is exciting but again - too familiar .

Did you know that human babies don't even come out with teeth ?
Oh crap oh crap oh crap ! Does anyone have any advice on how to fix it if a zeppelin becomes free from its mooring and blasts into the sky ?
I'm sorry we ever had a homosexual affair !
Our belief , based on the traffic cop's testimony , was that an " old silk hat " was responsible !
Well , good luck !
The next morning you'd get up and say , " Ouch ! I must have been disappointed a little TOO MUCH yesterday ! I'll have to go easy on the disappointment for a while ! "
SMOOCHITIS
They're all , um , on my opposite side with now . The side you can't see .
AMERICAN THANKSGIVING COMICS
ANYWAY , THEY TALK ABOUT CAR ALARMS FOR A WHILE , UNTIL A REALLY ATTRACTIVE FRIEND OF THEIRS SHOWS UP !
We'd have to press our tattoos together to make them line up and all the people would think we're married ! Plus what if we got the tattoos on our lips ?
I wonder what the future holds for me ! Looks like it's time for another terrifying . . .
Alright , I'm in . This sounds awesome !
However , that will be more than enough excitement for me !
Saying " We declare war " is the same , isn't it ?
Debt's not unique in this , though ! Lots of things rely on memory .
She chose to walk down the aisle with a British Archaeologist who was passing through town .
Ah . So the perfect dog is effectively a perfect organic cold fusion reactor , transforming any matter into caloric energy without waste . I'm afraid the government has taken your dog , T - Rex ! Its power is simply too great to leave in civilian hands .
I certainly don't know much about menopause , though !
Anyway your new mission is to lie about how rad Earth's defences are to any snowman you encounter . Dismissed !
So she finishes with , " IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE QUESTION MARK QUESTION MARK QUESTION MARK " . Why won't anyone take what Mark says at face value ? Am I right , Professor ? . . . That's comedy , Professor . It's beyond the reach of your previous " science " .
Sounds great !
It's cool to do two non - gender - identified people at once .
LATER , T - REX GETS INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE ANYWAY :
do you have any objections ?
Sorry dude , but it has !
Aw no , not this again . Come on T - Rex , passing off lyrics as conversations ONLY AMUSES YOURSELF .
QUITE LIKELY ! I don't know why I'm suddenly so into what is essentially juice mixed with maybe pop or alcohol , served in a fancy bowl with spoons , but I'm running with it .
Is there such a thing as an incorrect fact ? Doesn't being a fact imply correctness ?
That's pretty terrible .
Shakespeare , you should have a line that says " Forsooth , if this were in a play , I'd want my tuppence back ! "
DOG JOKES
So INSTEAD , you kill bad guys by moving your guys into their house !
Tired of all the things you usually eat ? Maybe it's time for
Oh man oh man !
Who smells funny on a specific day of the week ?
Holy , why is everyone so touchy about the tragic and fundamental flaws of their nature today ? I'm sorry we all don't share enough , but I'm not going to IGNORE it and hope it goes away . I deal with the issues !
What ? You're crazy !
Because it totally occurs to me that if I had different friends , I wouldn't be wrong all the time ! !
Man , if this were a bath , and there was a woman here , and I was hugging her ?
FEBRUARY :
Has anyone ever heard of a book series called , oh I don't know . . . " HARRY POTTER " ? !
But I just wish I could trust him to follow the damn rules . He reindexes data AGAINST MY ORDERS at all hours of the night : what's he looking for ? What will it take for him to settle down - and if he does , will it cost him his edge ? Will I get a more stable server farm but lose my best database in the bargain ? ?
I guess I get a . . . TINY bit depressed , T - Rex !
My shock is continued !
Sometimes if you have a festering wound , doctors will prescribe maggots ! Certain breeds only eat dead tissue and ignore healthy tissue , which cleans out the wound at a level a surgeon simply couldn't ! NICE .
T - Rex , I've got some bad news !
Sir , you have made an unforgettable choice .
If I'm being forced to do something against my will , I need some way to covertly communicate that to you , Dromiceiomimus ! Right now all I can say is " There is a dude here making me do stuff , and I do NOT count him among my friends " , but they'd probably pick up on that .
You were talking about robot cars ?
HEY T - REX YOU KINDA SHOULDN'T MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE WITH CELL PHONES
He may be unaware of certain pertinent pieces of information , and he may not be urbane . . .
This severely undermines what I said to Utahraptor , but I find I cannot resist !
The first communication satellite launched in August !
Or maybe they'll look back and be aghast at all the animals we kill and eat for food ?
" His nose was long , horselike to the max . His legs were typical , obviously sexy to other horses , and on his back sat some guy , AND his legs , like one half of a horse's legs , either front or back . "
Question : is it true that Spider - Man can do whatever a spider can ?
Hi , I represent the 20th century ! In the space of almost 50 years we invented planes , TV , helicopters , digital computers , nukes AND spaceships !
. . . Also the US economy crashed so bad that 40 % of banks died .
Hey Dromiceiomimus - wanna party ? ?
FUTURISM COMICS

A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN
Can a submarine sink . . . up ? Let's find out !
Computer crime costs billions of dollars every year ! And in retrospect , it totally stands to reason that once we created computers , those computers would of course start getting big into crime . However , due to a loophole in our meat - centric laws , NOT A SINGLE COMPUTER HAS EVER GONE TO JAIL FOR A CRIME !
Yes , criminals were referencing the Simpsons EVEN AS THEY GOT BEAT UP !
It would only add to the confusion .
Aha ! We're talking about Doctor Who !
THE SCARY PART IS THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR CREATION
Yep , again !
Bottom line !
Daaamn , tiny women ! That's crazy ! Come closer for a sec ?
Okay so first off I'm going to invent the week ! Monday's for inventing light , Tuesday's for inventing sky , Wednesday's for inventing stars and moons , Thursday's for inventing land and trees , Friday's for inventing sea beasts and birds , and Saturday's for inventing animals and dinosaurs and humans ! Sunday's for chillaxin' .
Okay ! Because if you're down with fall then you're down with me .
What strange town is this ? There's this endless high - pitched screaming and dead birds everywhere . And you , ma'am , you look just like my friend Dromiceiomimus !
I have been carefully constructing a pun that not only applies to him as an individual but can also be appreciated by countless others
Trees spew pollen which irritates my eyes and interferes with my ability to breathe
So let's assume the planet's magnetic field increases linearly with rotation !
Adults can sex each other up , but also can put so much meaning and pour so much hope into a single dream that , when this dream is finally achieved , it can never possibly live up to its expectations !
And the amygdala is responsible for FEAR RESPONSE !
That's it - I'll sell naked pictures of myself online ! FOR PROFITS !
Today is a good day , I think , for a guest comic .
That's me punching you in the face , saying " Try my other fist , now with 30 % less fat ! " and then punching you again ! . . . Which is also rad . Huh . I guess I like THIS ad slogan too !
I'm gonna DIE ? !
So much for original ideas , huh ?
True , but I also never told him how glad I was that he was corporeal so that we could hug easilty ! ! EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT THAT ALL THE TIME .
. . . It's actually " Doctor Madame Frances Experimento , LLC . "
What what ! Sailors also use them in SECRET CODES , and they have public meanings too : " J " means " J " but also " I am leaking DANGEROUS CARGO , stay back ! "
Your " wit " ?
I think I've figured you out , my friend !
I've got the ingredients , but they mutually annihilate and the only output of the reaction is I end up looking like a rube !
CHARADES AS SHE IS PLAYED
I really wish I'd invented fire extinguishers or something . Man !
Long enough ! Look , about yesterday : I'm sorry I said what I did . I've just been a little stressed lately . Also , stop saying " wigged out " . I know you like it , but it really annoys me .
You're so crazy T - Rex !
Compadres ! I bid you each : ADIEU !
What sort of conflict should be presented ?
And the balloon wasn't filled with helium ! It was filled with water .
Histories that begin " 1800s : Everyone who lived at this time is dead . Anyway , " ! Fiction that starts with " Even though these characters are imaginary they too will die , for even in fiction death stalks us all . In any case , it is a truth universally acknowledged , " !
But man , what makes us so interesting ?
such as the ipod shuffle
Our first home !
Unfortunately , your reasoning is flawed , T - Rex !
Like most authors , at the start of a new story I haven't quite decided if I'm writing erotica yet , you know ?
I've decided to write a story about my own team of superheroes . That's right ! They're called . . .
Imagine if we had a beach ball to kick around !
Make a mental list
I BELIEVE SO .
So you only dislike taxi drivers when they're driving taxis ? Maybe you just hate the game , but not the player !
Also delicious !
. . . Okay , so , hey , that list's way less hilarious than I'd thought it'd be .
He decided to straight - up ask her to seduce him so he'd be naked and " ready " for sex . But the vampire bit him on the neck instead ! It was not erotic . Those bites KILL YOU . How is that sexy ? A dude died : put your boners away . God . Show some respect .
For example , I'm talking to you right now but I'm not expecting you to whip out a sandwich for me at the end of this conversation .
The honest answer is " heck yes ! "
Kirk's talking to Spock .
LATER : EVERYONE PUTS SWORDS IN THEIR EMERGENCY KITS
As the saying goes , " three women are trice as nice " !
I guess we really had published . . . Bridgit Jones Diary .
No show !
Hey , I heard you were giving out compliments ?
I'm looking for excitement ! But so far it's been pretty much a " bust " .
Huh ! Mine have all ended with me getting punches to the gut . A fre ended in broken marriages !
That's not that much !
Peteeeeeey has a giiiiiirlfriiiiiend ! !
We don't feel qualified to comment ! !
It comes from the noun " tackey " , which meant a sucky horse ! And may I just say : it's SO GREAT that you guys are picking the horse words I know here .
AFTER THIS , WILL ANYONE EVER KISS T - REX AGAIN ? LETS FIND OUT :
I would like to start a biscuits and gravy club .
So I went for a walk last night before bed , simply because I wasn't tired yet and had nothing to do .
Maybe this is not so bad ?
But even if it's true you're a dying breed ! Soon an entire generation who posted stupid stuff when they were kids will finally come of age . When you can look up the President's author - insertion Yu - Gi - Oh fanfic from 40 years ago , do we finally admit everyone is dumb sometimes ? Do finally , at last , give up on shame ? On regrets ?
MAN DOES P EQUAL NP
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE OF PUNCTUATION
AGE 23 : KISSING ELBOWS
Are you doing it now ?
Oh man ! I've just had an elephant of a good idea !
LET'S ALL TAKE STOCK OF THE PAST WEEK COMICS
Oh Youuutahraptor !
Yes ; have you any suggestions ?
He never knew Bane's real identity , but after finding a beefed - up wreslter in Gotham named " Bay Aynne " , he started to figure it out . Before you knew it , " Clayton F . Ace " , " Kell R . Kroc " , and " Cal Enderman " were all in jail . Crime was done , the end !
I know ! I imagine Earth , seen from space , spots lighting up wherever people are looking , darkening briefly as they blink , beams blasting out into the universe whenever someone glances above the horizon .
You're not supposed to like it ! ! You're now " Sloppy Jalopy 3000 " .
Dude , I have seen zero paintings where you have laser eyes !

Yoo - hoo !
The Capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them - a dear friend , spouse , or family member - has been replaced by an identical - looking duplicate ! What seems to happen is that the automatic EMOTIONAL responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening , so when they meet their loved one , they have an intense feeling of something being OFF about them . They don't feel like they normally do !
Got any plans for the summer ?
BE SURE TO SPEND YOURS . . . ON twitter . com
What ! ?
James Fedex is your friend who promises ( for real this time ) that he'll DEFINITELY come over with some beer he owes you and party , only the best he can nail it down to is any point between 8 am and 6 pm today . So you stay home all day , but turns out you wasted your time because hahah he totally didn't show up ! And when you call him to complain he straight - up lies , saying his records CLEARLY indicate he showed up and YOU just didn't answer the door !
3 . ) FREE REGRETS
After that are the sports cars , which are the cool ones that look like toys , and truck cars , which , clearly , are the ones that look like trucks . And you may be asking , " Sup ! Listen , how come all cars don't look like toys ? Why can't we all drive awesome - looking cars ? " and I will give you your answer :
" Mammals " .
TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY COMPLEX OR WHATEVER
I AM FREAKING OUT A LITTLE HERE , NOT GOING TO LIE
He kinda did ! Honestly !
Maybe you should've been too busy paying attention to the cultural zeitgeist ? ?
STORIES FOR KIDS
Proudly ! !
Boooring !
T - Rex , you invited Dromiceiomimus to come party extremely hard and didn't mention anyone else going . I think you just set up a private party . I think you just set up a date .
I'm writing a Hallowe'en story ! A spooky story called " The Haunted Nun Who Dies ! "
Brussels Samoa , the evil genius who was always metaphorically and rarely literally locking horns with my superspy character Angola Maldives , was up to his old tricks again !
How was that an accident ?
ABSOLUTELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION
But it's fair because when I say " chicks " I'm not ONLY addressing women !
And that means we'll have a million events in 34 . 7 days . Which means you can expect to see a one - in - a - million chance about once a month !
According to the calendar in my computer , the world began on January 1st , 1970 at very the stroke of midnight ! ! It's impossible to make it go back earlier , and every moment is measured by the number of seconds since that one incredibly significant date ! History is a lie ! Unix software developers tried to warn us ! !
That's gross and you should wear bigger shirts . I'm so manly that when I glance at pregnant women they become pregnant with MY child instead . My line of sight is SO MANLY that it impregnates already pregnant women . Just in case that wasn't clear .
YOU'RE GOING TO STOMP ON A WOMAN AGAINST MY WISHES
There can be no further argument
Boo ! LET'S IGNORE THAT ONE .
BRAIN TEASER THURSDAY
Okay , have fun ! Be sure to tell them how awesome I am !
Oh my
" Nurses take care of the injured , but they injure who they take care of . "
I just - - um !
FAMOUS QUOTATIONS IN SINGLE PANELS
Hold on .
I know just enough about science for that to be really credible ! !
So here's how to get started on Facebook !
PROS OF EARTH : beautiful , good place to live , lots of trees and clouds !
Alexander Graham Bell spoke into his phone for the very first time . " Watson , come here . I want to see you , " he said . " Just a second , " Watson replied , " for you see , I'm a little busy . . . "
But they're BORING particles . Heck , I just made it up , so maybe " explosiontastic " is a particle too ! " I went to THE mall " makes me sleepy . " I went to EXPLOSIONTASTIC mall " makes me want to tag along ! Let's see what happens , you know ? Maybe explos - ions ?
STARRING T - REX THE TALKING DINOSAUR
That's still the same , yeah !
Let me answer that . . .
Really ? That's a little too after - school special for me and my past self .
THAT WAS . T - Rex : THE CRAZIEST . T - Rex : DREAM YOU GUYS .
I can't help it if no cannibalism is less memorable than tons of cannibalism !
" I envy your fertile loins . "
Dude ! It's not like you can't just make your own !
Do it quietly , yo !
No you're pushing better facts out of my brain !
flooded / dying / explosive / poisonous / vengeful / understated / parasitic
As far as last words go : a solid eight on ten ? ?
I believe that I believe that it may or may not be a nice day for stomping on things . Yes !
There are awards for everything awarded by everyone , and if you don't specify I'm going to assume you won the " Worse Than Hitler Award For Real Terribleness " . Unless it's the Nobel or the Pulitzer I'm really not interested !
Yeah . That he sucked .
I'll get friggin' FOODSTUFFS named after me , because clearly when someone needs to know what to name something , they just spit out whatever is in their mouths , stare at the mess in their hands , and say " Okay sure - call this city TOMATO PASTE CENTRAL " .
Or maybe they'll look like us , but , you know , ten times sexier . Everyone on Earth will feel bad about their bodies for the rest of time !
T - REX I MIGHT INSTEAD CALL IT " BIBLE ll : GUESS WHAT ? GOD RULES THE SCHOOLS AT EATIN' SLOPPY JOES "
T - REX YOU NEED TO EXIST TO RAP THEREFORE ANYONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST WOULDN'T RAP
Today I went to the - what do you call it , check it , one two , one two , one two , PHARMACY !
ANYONE who comes across a fully inflated airship , UNATTENDED , would be forgiven for boarding it and putting on the captain's hat and then pressing all the buttons . It's only fair .
Conclusion is a magical town where we're concerned with how a lot of things happen differently , Dromiceiomimus .
It's good times , if you're not in a car !
" I'm Captain Picard , and I prefer Firefly as it rules all schools , and also I can never take this back . "
You can't copyright a fact ( like a number ) , but you can copyright a creative work , like a song or a piece of software . But since one can be transformed into another , copueight law is logically INCOHERENT .
The only reason we call these people " great " is because we forgot their flaws !
Peace !
Anyway , the reason WE'RE here on Earth is that it's powered by the sun , so we have all this energy to create local pockets of order ( a . k . a . our rockin' bods ) in an otherwise chaotic system ( the cold , uncaring universe that will not notice our deaths and shall never grieve us ) . But . . . WHAT IF THAT WASN'T THE CASE ? ? What if the universe had the equivalent of a universe - sun outside it , powering everything , allowing entropy to always DECREASE ?
This sounds real nice
The word you're looking for is " defensible " !
Really ? Where ?
OH DAAAAAAANG
Well , technically you were " hungee " at the time , not hungry !
I'M AFRAID SO .
PROVABLY FALSE .
YOUR NAME
And if you do it in a room with no beds , that's a floorgy !
Butterflies ! Tiny brains . They literally can't simulate something so complicated and consistent as the reality you're now experiencing . So hooray , you're not a butterfly !
That's right !
Dude ! You're not allowed to lie to your own diary !
Not really , since there's nothing buried there yet ! It is pure FORESHADOWING .
I can't , I'm stuck here !
Then you baked the muffins , and then , you ate all the muffins .
Hah hah ! Of course !
with - words ?
AW MAN ! Sucky dogs ? POO bugs ? ?
NOTHING SO GAUCHE . But check this : he speaks seven different languages , he's really handsome , he wears suits , and I'm pretty sure he knows a lot about guns AND documents . I asked him what his favourite type of document was and I could tell he SO wanted to say " Stole - - I mean , no preference " .
I thought I'd actually start with logic gates , and build up to simple machine languages from that ?
And when you leave , you disconnect from the machinery and become a regular dude !
I just don't understand why nobody is going to class .
Or should I say , it will have been seeming like a good idea at the time ?
You're just saying that because you've never seen it done , dear friend ! But I'm gonna do it . I'm gonna figure out how to shape my tongue and mouth and vocal cords to generate the appropriate waveform , and then I'm gonna TRAVEL THE WORLD , saying two things at once .
For example , if you said " showers " and I said " s / sh / fl / " , you'd get " flowers " !
Yeah , and when it crashes everyone thinks they're dead , but then they burst out of the rubble on their skateboards yelling " EXTREME ! " and do ollies on the crumpled - up chassis !
So we've got a self - modifying system : we examine our personality , determine things we don't like , and try to make them better . But how do we decide what we don't like ? Our personality must feed into that process too ! So you've got this feedback loop that goes all the way back to when we were born and started making decisions . And it seems to me that if you changed just a tiny thing early on , you could get a completely different adult down the road !
There are tons of legal , ethical , and security issues you're not even considering !
True ! However , the plants now ALSO serve as a constant reminder of me and how I need water ( viz . , smooches ) !
Got it covered !
Easy ! " How many socialites does it take to change a lightbulb ? "
Hooray ! You agree with the sphere shape and so have won this adventure . By glossing over the inconvenient details , we have shown that the universe will last forever in an infinite series of expansion and contraction ! That means that YOU get one hundred points .
That's not a job !
Erk !
YEAH BUT DOESN'T THE WORD DUDES TECHNICALLY EXCLUDE WOMEN
IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN
NO ! It's freaking impossible to build a time machine ! My enthusiasm yesterday was clearly UNWARRANTED .
Agreed .
Let's lowball it and say only 50 million sperm are released each ejaculation . The sperm that turned into awesome ol' me had to get there first !
I know this may be sexist , but I don't believe a woman is capable of such neglect .
But what have you done LATELY ? I actually think that maybe you coast a bit on your past successes , T - Rex .
So many memories of the past two weeks . . .
PRECISELY . History doesn't know ! History spends all its time saying " come on what are the odds of surprise twins " and not enough time saying " wait , turns out the odds are 1 : 1 ! ! ! "
Oh boy , are we telling math jokes ?
Hey ! I bet GOD could give me that abili -
hello friend
I - okay ?
Why ? You've been there before !
I have been assuming that our development as a people is linear , moving generally from less to more permissive . It occurs to me :
Well , not JUST like you or I . She's reanimated dead tissue : MY origin involves my parents sexing , and then an egg came out of my mom , and THEN , I ate the inside of the egg , and then , I came out of the egg .
I speak , of course , of " music " !
T - REX ISN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY COMING UP SOON
Maybe , huh ?
Well let's see : less traffic , a shorter line at the park , I can't think of any others but there's probably more . . .
" Here Lies T - Rex : He Never Stopped Saying " Frig " / Even If He Stopped Saying Other Words " .
Every birthday is a celebration of DAY ZERO , where everything gets reset , and we see how much better we can do with THESE 365 days than we did the last time around .
It'll work ! Don't be such a downer !
So , it's like , H . G . Wells actually has a time machine that he uses for wacky escapades !
The difference is that infiltration includes exploring buildings that ARE currently in use , like subway systems and stuff , going places you're not supposed to go . We're only going to buildings that haven't been in use for years . It's more like trespassing !
Their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit . They never made it back ! A STANDARD MOUNTAINEERING TALE , except that if they had made it to the top , they'd have been the first , AND they were carrying cameras . If we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today , and then we'd know if they actually did make it to the top , since who climbs Mount Everest and doesn't take a picture ? NOBODY , that's who .
Attention , audio diary !
ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
Eh ? What do you think Dromiceiomimus ? Is my flow TRULY the freshest possible ? ?
That was extremely delicious ice cream !
Today's origin story : SPIDER - MAN
" What is - " he begins . His voice breaks . He collects himself and starts again . " What WAS . . . Jeopardy ? "
I know , right ? Now we've got TWO planetsworth of flawlessly sexy cheese AND / OR beefcake fighting extremely intelligently for SURVIVAL ITSELF . Tell me it's not a bestseller right there .
Hey , English ! Despite my complaints yesterday , you're still super sexist ! My only question is as follows : what gives ?
I frequently debunk your theories !
Dude , if you really think like that , then maybe you need to " unplug " for a bit . Spend some time " IRL " with your " meatspace " friends .
Nooooooooooo
I GOTTA SAY THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD GIST OF WHAT HAPPENED .
I'm not dead !
We've still got these conversation books today !
So what do you do when you want to give a loved one a present that is alive ?
Oh man - you're going to say " brute force " ! You're going to use the brute force approach !
If I must deal with others , it should be as TRADERS , in a pure capitalist system . No charity ! No sympathy ! Just business , an exchange of value for value .
Wait , what ? ? Sweetcheeks ? I'm sorry , I don't know where that came from . I don't normally call people " sweetcheeks " .
The issue is that some think ID should be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution , right ?
UTAHRAPTOR STARTED IT
" Save us from Little Mister Chubby Cheeks " everyone cried as a volcano erupted in NYC ! " Oh , Little Mister Chubby Cheeks , if only I'd recycled more , but it's too late now since lava is turning me into a skeleton . "
I TOO WILL LEAVE FOR I MERELY WISH TO PLAY CLASSIC NES GAMES FOR FREE T - REX
So why does a super intelligent AI make predictions impossible ?
So what meaning do you see my action representing ?
Man , forget this !
In # 2 we have solids ! Solids are so super great that we actually use them as a synonym for " super great " . " He's a solid dude " , we say . Solids combine the thrill of a liquid's tangibility with the frisson of a consistent shape that even plasmas can't offer . We love solids and solids love us , hence their . . . SOLID second - place finishing ? ?
Super !
He read for a while .
Or should I say . . . that is US ? ?
Why not read some fashion magazines ?
The polite thing is to ignore them !
How Are They ?
Let us start with the assumption that not all people are duds !
i don't know why people say in real life i would be shot . i wear bullet - proof armour !
You're sure ?
Good morning , Dromiceiomimus ! Beutiful day , isn't it ?
Yes , death ! Would you find it so funny if you died ?
Utahraptor , you scored two out of a possible fifty thousand points !
Yes way !
[ ] and I love you baby but i'm running out of ways to say " wow neat " to something i have ALREADY SEEN
Oooh , ads like that burn my biscuits . Of course they're not going to refuse a reasonable offer ! That's what makes it so reasonable ! And worse , since " reasonable " can be a very subjective word , it's not really saying anything beyond " Hey , I won't refuse an offer for reasons that I personally find irrational . "
Well , no , it's like -
. . . anyway , this leads us nicely into my new business card slogan :
Nope ! But that's because * I * happen to use a little friggin' thing called " tips " !
Ne ridigu min !
Peter : unkind .
Hah ! Diseases in the WATER ?
Yeah , chess is weird .
Hah ! Hey how did you know I use the internet ?
. . . Did you see what I did there , Dromiceiomimus ?
hmm , yes . What ABOUT free will , God ?
Okay , try this one on for size ! !
I don't know ! It's just that we're in a special place in history now , where it still matters that we've been to the moon . Once moon travel becomes routine people won't care so much , but right now , the landings are unique . They're still special .
I have ample kite - making experience !
Maybe the letter arrives when you're old because if you get it any sooner , you mess up in your rescue attempt and die ! Or worse !
I wasn't going to BRAG ! My lovemaking technique consists of a series of awkward fumbles and whispered apologies .
This guarantees me POPULARITY . Who would not like to hang out with someone who's the coolest ? The answer is no - one !
One ! Folks who use internal pluralization !
12t10o8e7a6l6n6u5i5s5d5h5y3I3r3fbbwwkcmvg
Don't you have a boat to catch ?
But T - Rex , think of all the stories in which the characters are running around in a realistic universe , unaware that they're fictional ! DUDE ! It's overwhelmingly likely that WE'RE in a story right now !
But there'd still be cockroaches in other cities that could hitch a ride when someone moves !
" T - Rex , " she said " I'm in love with you . " She gazed into his eyes , smiling . " I thought differently about it , and it's DEFINITELY because you're so handsome and intelligent . "
BACK TO NORMAL :
AN APOLOGY TO
Later , Ophelia's topless !
If there's one thing I know . . .
I also hope I was the one who ended it .
I can't believe it or not ! !
Okay , so I've been down on poems in the past . I MAY have been heard to remark " Guys , poetry bloetries . " But I've just discovered :
Dude , you just totally blew it !
Okay , NEW RULE : if you do something knowing it's a dick move , but that you'll EVENTUALLY be forgiven by the person you're being a jerk to , then you have voluntarily given up your chance at forgiveness !
In some ways it's naive for you to think that everyone would like this woman , but in another way it's really romantic , you know ? You thought she was , objectively , the best girl ever .
Hey ! Okay , this is maybe awkward but the sender of this card thinks you are a REALLY great friend , and he or she likes you very much , and here's the thing , maybe you should be kissing each other .
Geez , man . . .
Then his eyes rolled back in his head and Coke shot out from his face in a spectacular geyser ! And lo , the entire food court was drenched in warm sticky Coca - Cola , and we drank . We drank until we were sated .
First off , you should not say " um " or " uh " , you should say " check it , one two " .
LIFE IN THE OCEANS MUST BE SHEER HELL
What's amazing ? !
Also , I'm not sure how I feel about competitive eating .
( Turn around , stomp girl . ) Hey Utahraptor , I really appreciate that you think I'm " Oh - so Clever and Delightful " !
AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS , yes .
- during that time period . In one place were gathered the T - Rex , Utahraptor , and Dromiceiomimus - together , in one location , the greatest minds of our time .
TODAY'S FILM :
I have failed to prove my point !
I believe that particular point would have been better off remaining a subtle irony .
HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY STAR WARS RELATED CONVERSATION T - Rex : Um . . . George Lucas ruined everything ? Unknown : OH MY GOD ! Unknown : I KNOW

T - REX I HAVE RETURNED YOU TO THE PRESENT BECAUSE YOU MAKE EVERYTHING SEEM TERRIBLE
The same as " queue " , I'd imagine !
While he couldn't walk through walls , he could poke his head through them and look around !
Hey wait ! You forgot something ! Come baaaack ! !
i can do both
WELL , IN THIS PART , EVERYONE DIES .
Winning arguments is easy !
YOU OUGHT TO GET TVS OR SOMETHING
I'm not dishing on MYSELF , because then you'll clearly spread the gossip around , since only gossips would say " let's dish ! " . Also I am sincerely embarrased and ashamed !
Anyway THE POINT is that I came up with an elaborate revenge scheme in case it ever happens again .
And I do ! I really do !
Artificial economy of scarcity , my friend ! Like diamonds !
( Comics is a silent medium and we all just have to deal with that , okay ? ? )
It's a measurement of food energy , T - Rex !
? Go on
There's barely enough in a tube to kill a child , T - Rex , and that's if they eat it . It'll take much more than a tube of toothpaste to take you down !
In it , Holmes and Watson will come across a Mummy who has a curse , and then there will be a mystery involving the curse . Did the Mummy really kill from BEYOND THE GRAVE ? Let's ask Sherlock ; I'll bet he knows .
BY THE FOUR TOPS
Hence my new series : " I Left My Superspy Assassin Husband At Home With His License To Kill And This Happened ! I Can't Believe It ! "
But they were also concerned about people stealing their ideas !
That's where he was !
And a third " h " ?
OH MY GOD I need to go do that !
Q : Are there cities whose origins are lost , which is a non - dramatic way of asking if there are cities which PREDATE HISTORY HERSELF ? ?
Later on , murders !
I know ! IT'S SO WRONG .
" Also , every bit of current day poop came from there too ; pretty gross . "
No problem ! I have the whole weekend to find Christmas presents ! I'll get great gifts no matter -
Buy more salt ! It's free from the ocean ?
Proto - nostalgia !
Nope , only little babies !
BUT , it's also a great way to win debates . And if anyone calls you on it , you just say " Come on . Your attack on me is the real straw man fallacy here ; let's be serious . "
Well , you're done with him now !
Well , yeah !
Thanks , Japan chicks ! Lets have a beach party !
Now you know ! So - try to act surprised when it happens , okay ? ?
Maybe this isn't the best business idea ever .
Are we going to one day discover the sort of pants the second mate was wearing ? The exact key the final song was played in ? The ship won't survive on the sea bed forever : eventually it will collapse into a pile of metal and ceramic and decay even further . We may soon reach a point where we have learnt all that it is possible to learn about the Titanic !
GOOD EXCUSES FOR MISSING AN APPOINTMENT
That's not her name ! She was TOTES OFFENDED .
There's a lot you don't know about semiconductors , too !
WITH , LIKE , LICENSING DEALS
The bath ended . Sherlock stood , the water deducing off his toned legs .
That's what David said ! " Still ! Not bad ! Looks like things are turning around for ol' David ! "
It's too late to ask how or why . We're done for , Utahraptor . This is where our waterpark story ends .
Later I asked her about Christmas and she told me Santa wasn't real
Yeah , it's super metal ! Step 1 : CRUSH FOOD WITH SKULL EXTRUSIONS .
Okay , so let's hear it !
That's perfect !

A Story by T - Rex !
SEMANTIC SATIATION
Oh no , thinking about other people's chest pains aggravates MY chest pains !
Shoot ! You know what ? I was supposed to feed the dog today !
The fallacy of balance occurs when news agencies claim truth by reporting " both sides of the story " !
Hey Dromiceiomimus ! Give me a thigh five !
What larger trend are you possibly talking about ? The trend of theatres being full ?
LATER , T - REX'S HOUSE IS SWARMED BY PIGEONS CARRYING SPAM MAIL :
I guess I'm not used to feeling in the minority in knowing that animals can be friends AND food ! It's not hard ! You say , " Aw , that animal is SO CUTE " and then the camera cuts away and when it cuts back they have a bite mark out of them and I look cartoonishly guilty . The end !
What ? Since when ? !
Or maybe if they were selling well , you wouldn't know it yet !
He cleaned my bottom teeth !
Whoever said comics have to mirror real life ?
I know ! It's amazing !
HOLD ON TIGHT !
What is the attraction to this structure of humor ? Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars ?
No worries , Utahraptor ! With two cheques , if you put the right cheque in the wrong envelope , you'd have a problem . But the wrong cheque in the wrong envelope is logically equivalent to the right cheque in the right envelope !
Ghosts are incorporeal and thus pose no threat at all . You should of corse be aware of how the ghost of every mosquito , spider , cockroach , and poo bug you ever killed is crawling on your face right now . But don't worry ! They're ghosts ! Does it REALLY matter that they're all piled on top of your eyes , pushing their way in ? ?
GREETINGS T - REX
Hello Dromiceiolongname ! People call me the T - Blech !
WE
So if flour isn't scary , then MAYBE - just MAYBE - they were simply short of flour ?
Sometimes I'm concerned I'm not marketing myself to others effectively , you know ? I don't even have a video resume highlighting my personal development successes ! I'm MINIMALLY leveraging my reputation capital and don't even ask me about my impression management initiatives ! ! SHEESH . Honestly , my unique value propositions are barely differentiated for front - of - mind positioning .
This isn't an alternate history , T - Rex : this is the real - life history of the Luna 15 mission .
. . . !
The REAL T - Rex LOVES kissing , and he would never describe his tongue as " a wet prehensile muscle " ! !
You messed up !
Really ? Because my version seems PRETTY LOGICAL .
It is not a generic intensifier !
. . . Ah .
What an amazing tale !
Hey , you made the same mistake too ! Listen , is the internet working on your phone ?
This phrase can be used in reference to friendly good times !
Just one . . . !
You and your friends stand in a field , alone , too far away to really talk to each other . You wait there while someone else's friends line up and take turns hitting balls at you . And it's not like they're soft . They're really hard . You can catch them if you want .
I call it , " I Know ! I'll Ask T - Rex About My Stupid Problems ! "
Looks like this morning just got a friggin' GOALSET , baby !
I'm God and I'm going to create life !
WHOAH . She must have MONEY .
Seriously though , I'm sure your characters probably have other qualities that make 'em cool . Maybe when they're not quietly teasing apart their innermost motivations over a nice cup of tea , they're punching their way to success , right ?
Sounds creepy .

WHAT FUN
Popularity ! Everyone wants it , because that means a lot of people like you so obviously you get to feel better about yourself . But how do you GET popular ? Good think I'm here with . . .
Oh , like , I don't know . . . WORLD HUNGER ?
Being thus provided with a Compleat exposi - tion of the Dinosaurs , take care , gentle Reader , that you do not deviate from the strait and Upright path set before you by our Father , lest you find thyself in the same Posi - tion as these Beasts , and there be no roome for you on the Ark .
Also that was a private time but WHATEVER !
This is going to be great !
ALSO
Don't worry though , that last one's fatal to everyone , so no worries !
I guess he really WAS an Iron Man !
Our top - of - the - line NLP heuristics can convert ANY email - even the most non - sexy of work emails ! - into Snapchat with an enthusiastically consenting naked person in it . Thrill as guideline updates become guideSEXY updates ! And live in the joy of knowing that every email you receive can be viewed for only a few seconds before it's deleted forever !
Life's everywhere , man !
Hah ! EVEN WHEN THE EMAILS CONTAIN WEB CARDS ? ?
It's true . There no room in heaven for foul lyrics and mega rock riffs .
I am writing a spy story ! It involves a secret agent who likes getting martinis , girls , guns , AND the opportunity to say his own name partially , and then , a second later , more completely !
let's just replace the biological imperative to reproduce ! Let's give ourselves the same joy and wonder from an egg sammich as we get from first holding our child in our arms ! Let's make gum as deeply fulfilling as watching your child graduate top of the class , Dean's list , summa cum laude . Bubblegum flavour .
All right !
Does " Betty put butter on the bread " mean the same thing as " Betty buttered the bread " ?
Yeah , man !
Ah yes , the ocean . The comparatively - viscous sky of the sea !
Have you done anything to get rid of it ?
Your honour , you seem very competent ! I like that in a woman .
A MORAL ALLEGORY
Oh yeah , NOBODY is gonna want to buy the TERMINAL VELOCITY SKATEBOARD SIMULATOR .
( It was inspired by an actual motorist I felt terrible about AND for ! )
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
As well you should .
The guy who does what you're doing ! Argh ! You ARE being that Guy !
You go first , Dromiceiomimus .
That itself : one of my problems ! !
Okay ! How about with " womanly characteristics " ?
Two : time travel IS possible , and this timeline is absolutely the best one anyone could come up with
LATER , THE SUN EXPLODES :
For millennia His mind has reached out from the Arctic , shaping our dreams , twisting our perceptions until the only image anyone can retain when not directly looking at Him is the implanted memory of a smiling , jolly old man .
The population of the world in 400 BC is estimated to be 7 million people ! 7 million dudes !
I forgive you ! I forgive you so hard ! !
Utahraptor ! Homeslice ! Oh , I wasn't talking about you , I was referring to another debt which - um , I also owe ?
But it can be very difficult to convert states of being into plausible names , Utahraptor .
I was a fool !
Um , because he's the WORLD'S GREATEST DETECTIVE ? ?
" Your world is ancient , full of mystery "
Ridiculous ! The movie needed way more EXPLOSIONS .
THE DAY T - REX'S MIND BROKE
That's not what driving a car looks like !
T - REX AND HIS SUPER FRIENDS
EVERYONE TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF ; YOU'RE ALREADY WAY BETTER PEOPLE THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY
And then I'm sorry I thought it was " Doctor Madame Frances Experimento , LLC " !
The other ideas I got were " Wow it's horrible watching elderly people cry , should I stop the music now or what ? " and " God , why can't I pat people on the back and make it seem like a natural gesture ? ? "
Drat ! It DOES . Another brilliant idea ruined by a hilarious double entendre .
THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
[ ] so what , you want me to pretend I haven't seen it ? You want me to LIE ?
SORRY WE WENT A WEEK OR SO TOO FAR BACK ; THE EVENTS THAT LED TO EVERYONE DYING HAVEN'T REALLY STARTED YET
Dudes ! That's not that many dudes !
But what about civil unions ? And gay marriage ?
Hey buddy , do you know who that girl with the brown hair is ? I'd really like to ask her out on a date . She is a very good - looking young woman !
Um , parts of it , I mean !
It's been nice weather too !
So you decide you're in the market for a house !
That way I can menace someone with my fists and say " Do you WANT to visit the Chinese Buffet ? It's all you can eat TONIGHT , baby ! "
I can't believe that I didn't see that obvious flaw in my new philosophy ! *
Most of the time , we avoid doing things that have a serious chance of hurting us ! Thanks , instinct for self - preservation !
HE WANT TO WELCOME YOU HOME FROM WORK .
Utahraptor ! Awful ! !
Dromiceiomimus , I'm going to let you in on a secret , okay ? I have decided to stalk Utahraptor ! Can you help me out ?
Upon closer inspection that was actually more a gift for me than Utahraptor
Exactly ! Pants that say " I am a successful person ! " Shirts that say " IN A FEW YEARS I'LL HAVE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN WHAT I DID TODAY " . Cuff - links that say " Life is a precious gift ( WHAT the HELL am I DOING ) " .
" They go outside and see a lot of folks bumping into things ! "
Impossibly amazing ?
I was tired ?
I'M the one who's putting on weight . I'm getting old and chubby !
There I'll sub in some dinosaurs !
" Astute readers will note this book only goes to page 40 . "
What's the deal , logs ?
I'm still not immortal , but I HAVE managed to recontextualize birthday cakes into second - place consolation prizes for failing to achieve immortality ! Now all birthday parties are super depressing .
But don't be , because your awesome friend T - Rex has a solution . I have done some research into your crazy mammalian ways and found that human women are born with all their eggs inside them already ! Weird , right ? They don't even deposit them into the ground .
Hah ! Is that the first time that sentence has ever been said ?
In Canada , you get real winters AND real summers , and there's places where you can get winter all year round if that's your sort of thing !
Okay honestly I don't know how you need help with this . It's the easiest thing in the world , ESPECIALLY since aging happens automatically to everything that fails to die . Just wait around and you'll become an adult eventually , people ! Congratulations , you are now adult ! You are being an adult now , and we're done here .
THOSE ISSUES I CAN UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY , AND THERE I DON'T FEEL LIKE SOMEONE WHO JUST HAPPENS TO KNOW THEIR STUFF BETTER COULD BEST ME IN AN ARGUMENT .
Holy cow !
I guess
Not true ! !
Utahraptor , I'm not joking !
THAT should finally straighten up some things around here !
Utahraptor ! We totally are ! !
THINGS I'VE READ ON THE INTERNET COMICS
. . . If it passes the test of time ?
You think horses care a lot about legs ?
ALTERNATE ENDING
It seems like a really crappy ending to me !
But maybe , building a time machine to an alternate universe : NOT SO HARD ? ?
Novice artists spend years looking for their " own voice " only to find they've painted themselves into a corner or waited for a bus that never comes ! And what of myself ? Do I stomp tis house because I want to , or because I can't think of anything else ?
Good point , T - Rex . Shouldn't you be in Japan ? Because , you know . Godzilla went to Japan .
And though I never thought I'd say it , fifty - one is just TOO MANY BURGERS .
I'd like to have some nightmares , please !
Damn girl , I think I just bit my tongue ! Yeah , I got that guy good , babe . I bit right into the prehensile mean that lives inside my face but you know as soon as blood stops pouring out of it I'm gonna slip that flattened fleshy tube right inside your mouth .
1 : There's one of you ! However many of your there are , there are that many of this other thing .
WHEN TO USE " I LOVE YOU " : ONLY WHEN YOU WANT TO TELL SOMEONE YOU LOVE THEM
It's probably better than it sounds ?
Wait . that is terrible .
But you'd never be happy again either ! You'd probably be in this grey state of apathy for every second of the rest of your life ! That doesn't sound appealing to me : always being out of sync with your friends , never knowing when to smile . . .
Aw boo ! Researching things , much like the mental illness of depression , is for chumps !
Man , it happens all the time in cartoons ! ! Santa gets a cough and then OH NO , Christmas is cancelled AGAIN !
they go on for SO long and we all get tired
Much as a watch implies a watchmaker , so does our universe imply divinity !
Oh my god , Becky , look at her butt . 'Tis so big ! !
T - REX HAVE YOU ACQUIRED ANY NEW VIDEO GAME CONSOLES OF LATE
Let's listen to one ! Give me your absolute favourite .
The answer is simple :
Hey there Utahraptor ! Have I ever told you that you're a prints among men ?
We're obsessed with fake people who do not exist !
I guess you're righ - Hey !
God's a big fan of decorum . That was his idea too , T - Rex .
There's got to be SOME places left on Earth where there's no laws .
Why don't you chews to do something else ? That would be good gnus to me !
Oh my gosh all my life I have been training for this question !
You ever wonder if these amazing creatures will get messed up by future generations ? Like , instead of having awesome dinosaur parts , they'd replace them with something much wimpier and softer , like I dunno , mammals or protoprimates ?
Sure , but not ALL maggots only eat dead tissue ! Sometimes if you leave a wound untreated , maggots that eat ANYTHING will hatch and live there . It's gross . I think we can all agree that physical bodies are gross , Dromiceiomimus .
Excellent
That's pretty sexy , I'm told !
Seriously ! How come ?
Pretty major form of literature , Dromiceiomimus !
Frig ! Good catch ! !
Isn't that right , Dromiceiomimus ? Wealth and power and knowledge and love and friendship are all fleeting and pointless ! Whoo ! One day will we all be dead !
" Dromiceiomimus " . Your name is " Dromiceiomimus " .
I can't , man !
Imagine an alien race that poops their pants all the time ! They walk around and everything would be fine and then BAM : poopy pants .
If I had three wishes - and the wishes had to be about cartoon stereotypes being real , I guess - then those are the two I'd choose . The third one would be " no falling when running off cliffs unless you look down and notice you're running on air " , because that , my friends , would be HANDY .
It's kinda awesome that these words are built to flatter new parents .
Can I get a what what ?
Oh , nothing . Frig .
Well . . .
Wooo !
You wanted to see me , chief ?
From now on , all the WAY COOL people are happy !
TYPES OF CARS
You're a good friend , T - Rex , but I'm not sure if you're the ultimate friend ! It seems to ME that the ultimate friend would come over and do my dishes for me .
Well - I was asking if you wanted to chew your food thoroughly , that's all !
I WARNED IF YOU ATE ANY MORE WINGS THEN 199 THINGS WOULD GO WRONG IN THE BATHROOM
And if people start causing trouble , I will say , " Are you looking for trouble , Mister ? Because you have found the trouble you were looking for ! "
Metaproblems ?
YOUR BEATS ARE SO STALE I THINK THE EGGS IN THEM HAVE GONE OFF
My debt ?
I have an extra $ 50 that I have saved . I believe I will put it in my bank account !
Gotcha !
WHAT
Girl you know if I get your consent I'm gonna press my lips up against the nice parts of your head !
Abandoned puppies , and little birds with a wing in a cast . Aww !
You shut up ! Don't try to push me around !
Basically infinite out - of - genre cover sequels , that is !
Okay you can't see that but I actually did a pretty good job .
Not really selling me on Canada here , dude !
YOU FORGOT TO GIVE ME THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM !
But in order to keep my friends and Status in Society , I am going to be fake racist . I'm going to be racist against folks who - who say " y'all " .
I heard that tattoos with the letter " h " in them . . .
Then you need to choose what you liked about the book !
Seriously ! It's predicated on history always being a story of progression , with the future assumed to be a better judge of what's right than the present . I'm not sure that's valid ! Plus , I'm certain there's things that have been variously judged to be good and bad at different points in history !
It was a super popular color with 16th and 17th centruy painters . It only stopped being made when we used up the necessary ingredients .
A private room ? Oh man , were you just namedropping M . C . MASTURBATION ?
PERSONALLY , I think they'd be pals .
But it's okay , because everyone hates racists , right ?
Welp , that's it for me . I had a good run , Utahraptor .
Didn't you forget about . . . SHANNON ?
Wait , huh ? I'm not the sort of person who says " natch " . I never say " natch " , I say " naturally " and even then only sometimes . I have no idea why I said " natch " just now . I'd like to take it back , Dromiceiomimus !
And then afterwards we'll discuss philosophy or something like that , OK ?
Girl are you a dog because I want to play fetch and run around with you and scratch behind your ears and sneak you people food
Are you having trouble programming your computer ?
Heck yes !
Basics , eh ? Hmm . . .
I'll let history be the judge of that !
I'M NOT JOKING , DUDE
Yet I can't help but notice we were born too late for chamberpots , but too soon to just have it beamed out of our bodies . Into a giant pile . That we then beam onto our enemies' heads .
THAT'S SALAD , WE'RE DONE HERE
SHEESH , T - Rex !
Aw , heck .
Verifying solutions ( NP ) can also be done in polynomial time !
How about instead of counting money , you count the number of lives you've touched in a positive way ?
Flattering ? What if everyone writes the same complaint ?
Insufficient data for meaningful answer !
Sex !
" If there was a singular Dickens who had to pee , I would be SO like him right now . "
One day a babysitter wondered why the kids were so quiet , so she went to the basement and there was a murderer with a bloody knife there , and that explained why the kids had been so quiet ! !
So Kay obviously then became a superhero ?
" I Correctly Answer Whatever Question You Ask Before You Press Play ; Use Me To Invent Stuff "
Wow , three wishes !
Not exactly this ! He also says that life in the state of nature was " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short " , a compelling phrase unmatched by my poor offering of " sage Buddhist dudes " . But I have a better phrase !
It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us , but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close . So the result is we ( as learners ) end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with , wut which is slightly different than those that surround us !
Hello ? ! He does ! !
Don't bother showing up to my dinner party , HOMOPHONES .
Utahraptor , did you know I tooted the bed ? ?
How can Dinosaur PRESENT day be coming up ?
The question is . . . does P = NP ?
It is a common misconception that science fiction is just fantasy with a justification for the fantastic elements . What people forget is that science fiction rules and fantasy . . .
I don't know . This card isn't very personalized .
. . . You heard me .
Oh man ! Remember when it was legal not to be on Facebook ?
Shakespeare has drawn attention to the hella dumb , and in doing so , addresses and placates audience concern !
Me too ! !
ETIQUETTE OF THE FUTURE
And that's why humour , horror and erotica are the # 1 best genres !
One way is to shake , or nod , your head , depending on which culture you're in .
I will call the book , " An Unexpected Ending " .
Dude , that's just a a GIANT BATHTUB .
Oops !
Jess / Jessifer !
But removing them can be tricky , as if they burst infection can follow . IF ONLY there was some secret way to lure maggots out of a wound , something SO DELICIOUS - SO IRRESISTABLE that not a single member of the animal kingdom can resist its wonderfu -
That , my friends , is called " graphic design " .
OVER five babies ! OVER five babies , dude ! !
Well , I mean , it might take a few minutes to drown .
AW MAN , WHAT THE HELL
For example , the franchise manual is titled " Let's Talk About Our Relationship " .
So here's the pitch : LASSIE - the dog everyone remembers , great at solving problems AND warning folks that Timmy fell down the well ! Only this time around , Timmy didn't fall down the well : he was PUSHED .
Years in the future , folks will try to reconstruct you from those few words . " Who was 'T - Rex' ? We know of his interest in 'them quote books' [ sic ] , and we can assume he found demonstrative pronouns a challenge . "
MAILBAG WITH T - REX
Once upon a time there were a bunch of dudes but none of them were me , T - Rex . Then one guy who was really great said " I will create a dude who is even greater than I am " and everyone else said " No way , that'd be awesome " and he said " Should I do it ? I'm gonna do it . . . . Should I do it ? " and then he did and the result was me , T - Rex !
Imagine if I snuck up behind some guy and put a " kick me " sign on his back , only instead of " kick me " , it said " kiss me " ? Hah hah !
AAAAHHHHH SO GROSS , A HERNIA IS WHEN YOUR ORGANS POP OUT OF THEIR REGULAR PLACE AND START TO ESCAPE OUT AGAINST YOUR SKIN !
But the only difference between interest and rent is the interest is paid in the same medium as the thing borrowed , which , in a single word , is KINDACRAZY . It's like renting a helicopter and then paying rent in tiny pieces of helicopter !
That was graphic !
Today is a good day I think for asking profound philosophical questions !
Hmm ?
So awesome ! !
BIRTHDAY FUNNIES
Writing in your own response , based off the teachings of whatever religion you fancy ! Have fun , but remember : the T - Rex doesn't like to swear !
Okay so here is what people care about : plot . Sometimes people say they care about characters and characters studies and studying characters , but they're kidding themselves because you know what characters do ? PLOT .
- ortunately , there's a library nearby !
Wow .
I am truth and beauty !
Is it ? Is it REALLY ?
THEN whatever Dromiceiomimus does in her game you do in Utahraptor's , and whatever Utahraptor does in response you do to Dromiceiomimus ! In effect , Dromiceiomimus and Utahraptor are playing each other , BUT WITH ONE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE : you're going to win at least one of these games ! Congratulations : YOU ARE NOW WINNING AT CHESS . " Check and mate , " you can say !
That's not very erotic .
UTAHRAPTOR I meant " go tell your own story that's worse than mine " !
THE WORST THING
DINNER IS ON ME , AND WE'RE HAVIN' BIRD
Yes , it was quite a corker !
Or , knowing that no matter what , you're NEVER going to win the lottery !
Building a you is simple , mainly because everything you are runs on simple hardware we call " a weird lump of alive fatty meat " , or " brain " !
Hah ! Riiiight .
Yeah , but dude , I didn't mean it in a sociopathic way ! !
Sex is weird
Although , sending a web card isn't really the best way to address this . Maybe the sender of this card has some problems with social skills too !
Ooh ! " Enabled bioelectromagnetic synergies " !
But there's no conflict if everything is solved right away by flexing brainacs in swimsuits .
T - Rex !
They're " pretty okay " .
But it's an overreaction , isn't it ?
And when you woke up you remembered that moral !
This is a story for children , I dunno .
Deus Ex Machina is the most excellent of all literary techniques because it's the only one where God shows up and says " Hey fellas , what the heck's going on ? " and then solves all the problems .
Future generations ! If I should not survive this minor surgery , remember these , my parting words :
T - Rex , are you truly a size - racist ?
You must realize that this isn't a fair application of utilitarianism , T - Rex !
GREAT IDEA , RIGHT ? ?
ONE UNIVERSE OVER :
The only cure : FURTHER SMOOCHING . Symptoms include smooches and caressing about the neck . And buttocks ?
And No , It's NOT What You Think ! !
And guess what ? We do gravitational assists with Earth ON THE REGULAR !
You haven't thought this through ! You're just interested in fisticuffs because of the name !
PROBABLY NOT
This doesn't count .
Dude ! It's this delightful deep brown , kind of a burnt umber ?
I really hate doing the dishes !
Still no good , my friend !
One day a lady named Pasiphae gave birth to a creature with the head of a bull and the body of a guy , which she named " The Minotaur " . First name " The " , last name " Minotaur " , I guess .
But you saw his tiny floating head yesterday !
Exactly ! But it helped me realize : even when I'm dreaming of interesting things like zombies or sexin' , it's still kinda disappointing .
So let's say I'm a painter , and I've studied really hard and I've worked really hard and I've become one of the best painters in the world . Hooray ! Except there's one problem :
I - oh . I put two and two together .
i'm a tiny dude
SEVEN YEARS LATER . . .
Don't you mean " a machine that tells you how you are going to die ? "
Get dog food for my very angry dog !
OKAY YEAH but what if he DID , he'd have to wait BILLIONS OF YEARS just to get back to the point we're at now !
Even Presidents have been seen producing music , and under their oversight music was included on the Voyager spacecraft , spreading the infection out to the cosmos . Earth shall not be forgiven .
Only extending existing technology forward . Why are we till shackled to the cell phone interface ? It's a thought - activated process , so why do we have to dial ? And if we're implanting stuff , why not put the same sensors by the mouth and avoid the hands entirely ? Plus , I mean , this way YOU could use the phone as well .
The amygdala doesn't just do fear , anyway : it's also responsible for long - term memory rentention ! The more emotional the memory , the better it's stored . If you lose it you also lose the ability to learn from feelings !
You know what ? Screw those guys , man ! I don't even care if it WAS their Word of the Day last week . It's my Word of the Day TODAY .
Also on the cusp of grinding cows into a mash , shaping it into a patty , cooking it , and serving it in a bun with lettuce and junk on top ? ?
You got closer and closer to it , Zeno - style , but I don't remember you actually TELLING it .
Sure , but it also means that there's no limit to your horizons , that the future can always promise more than the present , and that you'll never run out of things to learn .
good pronoun use !
Let's hear it , dude !
I'm glad you asked ! ! It's like a clunky version of the perfect Enterprise D that would follow : imperfect , oddly proportioned , and just so - lovable ? Like , instead of curved nacelle pylons , it's got awkward right angles . It's Teen Enterprise .
You know what I miss ?
I actually don't think I ever want to find out !
Aw damn ! My freezer is broken !
Argh ! Two weeks !
I didn't know there'd be a quiz ! ! Anyway , I know the highlights : Adam and Eve , garden of Eden , and there's a talking snake which honestly is a PRETTY GUTSY thing to open up a religious text with . You're all " this is a very serious book , everyone . Okay ! Here's Slippy the Talking Snake ! "
I DUNNO
I'm not ! Here's some REAL TALK : I'm really complaining about myself . I hate that soon there'll be a new phone and I'll WANT it so much I'll despise the perfectly good phone I have now . That's not who I want to be . But I ALSO don't want to be stuck with a Zack Morris phone !
Kelp piled on too , making the plastic sink to the ocean floor and right into a subduction plate , where it was drawn into the Earth's mantle and harmlessly destroyed .
. . . break science .
Come now , don't be shy !
Solution : DESSERT .
Incidentally , how come we don't get invited to more weddings ? ?
Yep ! Sure , women get to feel the miracle of life growing inside them and the joy of birth or of laying eggs or WHATEVER , but we get to engineer hairy faces AT OUR LEISURE .
Okay , I hate to be the one to say it , but I must be pretty great because I just had ANOTHER brilliant idea about time travel ! Suppose it's possible to send a message BACK IN TIME .
I am a guy who really likes Batman . And it occurs to me : at some point in my life I'm going to be an old man !
No refunds are permitted on this fare .
I was more pointing out that you're the guy who's drawing the equal sign between doing the dishes and having sex . They could be unrelated !
Luckily for you , a good EDUCATION in story doesn't need conflict ; all we need are easy - to - understand facts presented clearly . So that's what this is .
Grandmoms are great for that !
I wonder what the most important day of my life is ? Yesterday ? Tomorrow ? Maybe even . . .
Some guys wake up in the morning , and they're crazy . They don't know how many men they'll punch that day . They write in their diary and say , " Dear Diary , anything could happen today . " Then they pause thoughtfully , adding " I don't even know . " Some guys get to wake up in minimum - security holding cells , laughing . Some guys get to think about it when you ask them what city they lived in last year !
CAN NOTHING BE DONE TO RESTORE THE NATURAL ORDER ?
Once upon a time
He met his friend Dromiceiomimus who was also pretty nice . They were going to go on a trip . . .
word !
Or MAYBE , climate isn't changing at all . Or maybe it is , but who cares because it's all someone else's fault !
Now that I've asked that , I'm thinking , hey , the north and the south poles are really just points the Earth rotates around , right ? So an east and west pole don't really make sense .
What in tarnation is happening here ? Get out ! I have a lot of work to do today !
Wow , EVERYBODY ? ?
Hello everyone , it's me !
As in , " Huh , T - Rex fixed humans ? " I AGREE ! !
Normally when we get together we all see a movie or something , but it was a great idea to go swimming . I had a great time , and I'm sure we all enjoyed the decadence of swimming in an indoor pool when it's still chilly outside . Let's do it again sometime ! Thank you for setting this up .
Still , maybe you've got a bunch of tied - for - second moments , and I bet all those combined are better than one single best moment !
Your name sounds like tea is being ruined .
FRIG ! !
Sure do !
All you problems are problems ABOUT problems , dude !
SOON
In today's society , knowing a little about computers can go a long way ! They're not magic boxes . In fact , the more you learn about them the less magical they'll be !
missed me idiot
Anything on . LOL would be the least funny thing ever in time . HOWEVER , everything on . OGC would be AMAZING . Wikipedia gets . FYI ! Blogs get . TMI and . IMO !
Fuck me !
Oh man what the hell ? ? Is Vin Diesel a cat ?
Sherlock Holmes was still dressing up as Batman , but now he had teamed up with Bruce Wayne , who was also dressing up as Batman ! " I'm seeing double : FOUR BATMEN " criminals would say !
Dromiceiomimus , do you think it's cool to do two chicks at once ?
Antonio Tony could see dead people !
Post - war nuclear paranoia !

SOON EVERYONE GETS SICK AND IT'S ALL T - REX'S FAULT :
Then you'll love Sam ! She restarts her computer every time some software tells her to , AND she collects browser toolbars because they're " fun " and " free , so what's your problem " .
What should I do if I see someone littering ? Every time I do something different and every time it feels like the wrong thing to do .
Where'd you get it ?
Friggin' scientists !
It's great you're cooking more , but you don't even need the canned tomatoes . You can start with fresh ones !
I'm grinning from ear to ear , T - Rex !
As a matter of fact , yes , you do !
when to peace the fuck out . "
My sinister raccoon and cephalopod neighbours are having a sleep - over party . Okay ! That's innocent enough . I don't judge !
Each moment is unique , and life is but series of moments , connected by our memories ! We speak of events occurring in the past only as a matter of convenience .
I just have the SYMPTOMS . It's this stupid cold I keep getting . Um , every spring .
That sentence is stupid !
Stupid Science , thinking it has all the answers to all the questions !
They're mostly lifted from Wikipedia !
THAT WAS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALL SAW TERMINATOR 2 . THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
" Casey and Riley sat in front of each other and showed off their naughty bits ! "
TIP : To see what dead relatives are seeing right now , turn on " incognito mode " .
For generations we've wondered if we're alone in the universe ; today we know the answer : no . We're not alone . Life is out there , and it's puppies . Our universe is teeming with puppies .
That would be a good task for the new year , yes .
We zoom in on his bleeding wings and bruised face as he looks out across the wreckage . Then , we switch to a POV shot , lingering on different elements in the warzone : buildings destroyed by implosions . Giant bacteria lying limp and dead across city blocks . Evidence of fantastic creatures and powers , used only once , and resulting only in self - destruction .
I don't think he's home .
Can one truly be a man Dromiceiomimus , when one puts " everything " in quotation marks ?
EXTREME ! !
I have made a very important New Year's Resolution ! It's to make sure that my name becomes an EPONYMOUS ADJECTIVE . People will soon all describe things as " T - Rexian " ! What sort of things ?
But the spookiest part ? The killer is almost certainly dead now , and that means that according to SOME theories of the afterlife , he's now a ghost committing ILLEGAL GHOST CRIMES ! !
Dromiceiomimus is a nautical engineer ? !
Consider the following !

The king locked the girl in a room filled with straw and said if she didn't spin it all into gold , he'd murder her . Kings , right ? The girl was doomed , but then a small man appeared and offered to accomplish this impossible task for a small fee ! And incredibly , he did . The next morning , the king demanded the girl repeat the trick , and anyway long story short the girl ended up deeply in debt to the nice man who kept helping her .

Check it out : replace the caller with a computer , and you make the bingo numbers get called like a billion times faster . Replace the bingo players with other computers , and you speed up the rate at which the game is played . Tie both these innovations together and you can play HUNDREDS of bingo games per second ! ONCE AGAIN , something has been made orders of magnitude more efficient by simply replacing all life involved with cold and soulless bingo - playing machines .

Well , remember that everybody's got to die of something , and a lot of the reason these wizards are getting a chance is that we've beaten or imprisoned so many that would've otherwise killed you long ago .

STAR WARS : your character is a child prodigy who wants to destroy a space jerk ! HAMLET : your character is a problem head of state who wants to unmask a powerful senior . THIS . WORKS . DONE . THANK ME LATER .

But your first assumption is flawed ! I doubt you can find even one universal constant ; even your revealing example of baby - rape is practiced by some ! Granted , these people are considered " monsters " , but isn't that just a case of the majority condemning a minority ? I don't mean to justify baby - rape , but only to point out that it's unlikely you can come up with even one belief that is universal !

An idea : we should all go on a road trip !
To be fair , though , it WAS a good party .

Look , I'll give you an analogy . You know how you want an awesome Batman action figure ?
Besides , if I was , it would be self - skepticism , not self - doubt . Doubt can be irrational and unfounded , but skepticism relies on a critical evaluation of the facts at hand , and an informed judgment of their merit .

Spring break ! !
I should make a comic where famed scientist Francis Bacon teams up with a guy named " Eggs " , so they can be called Bacon and Eggs . In issue two , Francis could mistakenly rename himself to " Chris P . " ! Chris P . Bacon !

Writers ! Do your characters have a rich inner life that demands they introspect themselves with their full , undivided attention ?
You're surrounded by the collapsed remains of civilization , and you mind is now consoling itself by retreating into the heay realm of fantasy !
Weddings aren't just about tired cliches ! They're always changing ! They used to be for family , now they're more for your friends .
THE PAST IS UGLY , Dromiceiomimus ! !
. . . wait , that sounded like I'm bad at it ! ATTENTION LADIES ! !
First off , you're gonna need a computer and a game idea . If you don't have a game idea , here's one you can use for free : what if there was a cute li'l ant who wanted to help its friends build up their ant colony some ?
Well - come on !
My thesis is that when a guy is like , " am I finally good enough ? " , chicks totally dig it ?
It's my understanding that he died an infinitely rich man infinity years later
Besides , nothing says " cultured " like playing the piano !
Hmm .
But not too fast . It's not a race or anything . Just read at your own pace .
Well , I'm wondering if it's purely a physical thing , or if maybe he's got this weird fetishistic cultural interest in Asian countries as well . The whole " ooh , it's foreign to me , how FASCINATING and EROTIC " thing , coupled with a cultural conception that exaggerates the broad brushstrokes while ignoring its subtleties .
I just woke up with the phrase " 50 million dollar church for squirrels " stuck in my head !
. . . stories that , it turns out , are false !
Not to mention water monitoring and cycling and mixing equipment , PLUS backup generators for all of the above . And when salt water evaporates the salt's left behind , which in a tank can increase salinity to toxic levels ! So add on a fresh - water auto top - off system to keep the water level , well , level .
I feel a little funkier .
Look , if you're serious about this , then go buy some unincorporated land and build a road and house there ! I think your street name's considered when the land is incorporated into a municipality .
I don't know , T - Rex ! I might !

Then we have " hot as hell " , which being at the centre of the Earth is around 6000 degrees celsius , or 31 fish greases . This is followed by " hot as the sun " : 15 million degrees celsius , which science dictates is around 2500 hells , 79 thousand fish greases , or 1 . 5 million skeletons .
Also , when she gets sick she trashes your shit and only wants to show you porn .
Excuse me , are you " Jennifer Klug " ?
Hullo T - Rex ! Can I ask you a question ? It won't take a minute .
Okay ! PEACE OUT Y'ALL , IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN EITHER I AM A CORPSE OR YOU ARE A BIG OL' SNOOP
Now add sensory organs o that the world can be experienced and understood !
I was thinking more " You know who reads comics ? HORRIBLE MURDERERS . " and then a picture of a horrible murderer , you know , maybe murderin' something , and THEN , in tiny letters , " and also you , hopefully ! " and then maybe a line drawing of a soggy dog giving a thumbs up .
Oh man !
Besides , everybody knows that the smart way to build a time machine is to spend your life building it , but then have your future self send it back in time to you right now , thereby saving you the effort ! You've been wasting your time !

No , they're the Fields Medal and the Abel Prize , and the Fields Medal only goes to people under 40 . That's part of what perpetuates this myth of " nobody over 40 is good at math " .
Not you what ?

Hi ! I'm a guy riding his bike with his poor dog trailing behind it , TIED TO A CHOKE CHAIN .
Your sense of disenchantment comes from a realization that the world is not as you believed !
Nope ! Next question .
We followed the Germanic roots of the goddess Frigg's name instead of the English ones !
And he'd also be good at solving puzzles because he'd always get to each cheese after .
Her impact would knock the prince out of his orbit while simultaneously converting him into a deadly ocean of magma . And so , although she was tempted , the princess pushed herself a little bit away from the prince every single day , forever hiding her true face so that the prince wouldn't see her tears .
I don't want to blow any minds here , but now I'm going to totally blow all the minds , right here .
Fahrenheit DOES ensure there's no negative numbers when dealing with commonly - encountered temperatures .
And that's beautiful ?
Well I for one would like to know what these ceilings are , so I don't hot them accidentally !
Unless you're willing to go through life named as " Nowipe Poopbuttoms " I don't want to hear about how names don't matter . Honestly , all I want to ( EVENTUALLY ) hear is how greatest mind of a century was born today and carried the name " Babybutt Babybutt Myfaceisababybutt " into adulthood .
so this book is about dinosaurs instead
So I looked into it and it turns out beat deafness is a thing ! I could have an ACTUAL BRAIN THING that prevents me from hearing beats , which could ALSO explain several other things , including why I find it so tricky to rock a rhyme that's right on time ! !
So all superheroes should be scientists .
There's nowhere to go but down !
You're going to be a crotchety old man , my friend !

Are you guys serious about this ? I know that Everest has become touristy lately , but I didn't know they let just anyone climb it !
THE DAY T - REX INVENTED SOME NEW SLANG
I ordered this big appetizer platter " for my friends when they arrive " and distributed it so there was food for everyone , slowly picking at my share while the rest went cold . It was great . I perfected this heart - breakingly hopeful glance up whenever new people came it .
Instead , I'm going to hunt down each of my so - called " friends " , one by one . And when I find them , I'm going to tap them on the shoulder and say " Did you honestly think you could hide from me forever ? Really ? BECAUSE I FOUND YOU . "
It's such an awesome name !
Man ! It happened again ! !
You the man , my friend !
I'd argue that they're different words that HAPPEN to have the same surface morphology . Like identical twins ! They look and sound the same , but they're different people and one of them is evil . You can't tell just by looking at them !
That's what I'm saying ! I agree 100 % ! !
Or so you think , T - Rex !
In olden times people would go out at night ! And they'd have a fun time with friends ! And they'd stay up really late and get real sleepy !
Let us consider one Super Mario , esquire !
You have a crazy useless head of state ? Also , you end up with weird pro - regent laws where if you have a Queen everything SECRETLY belongs to her and if you pull an April Fool's prank on her you go to jail .
I tried that !
It's DEFINITELY time for me to fix the great works of fiction !
BONUS PANEL : THE COMPLETE TEXT OF " THE SMELLY DOG WHO POOED " !
Making a less informed vote worth less ?
Hello little Dromiceiomimus ! You are certainly a nice colour this morning !
noooooooooo
Time to learn about filmmaking , babies ! And that means learning about shots ! !
Ah , Dromiceiomimus , that's actually " better at it than I " . An easy way to remember is to include the " to be " verb you're dropping : " better at it than I am " sounds right , while " better at it than me am " does not ! Easy !
I . . ERR . . YOU SEE .
Is she . . . a talking horse ?
I'M not the one who wears itchy shoes , lady .
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THEM FOR THAT ? ?
Hi Dromiceiomimus ! Did you . . . READ THE PAPER TODAY ?
HOW TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS AS AN ADULT
So what's the secret ?
Wastin' food !
Gwen Stefani is not a holla back girl ! This is her shit , and it is recognized as bananas .
But the buildings are still there , and they're great . It's clich ? , but walking around you see all these amazing little tokens of previous life : a forgotten doll , a can of food long since unidentifiable . . . Dromiceiomimus and I are going back . Want to come ?
" 'Excellent ! ' they said , in unison ! "
You name the charity .
But suppose our greatest champions get thirsty ?
Hooray ! More crackers for everyone !
FRIG YES
I know , I know . IT'S NOT LIKE SUMMONING BEETLEJUICE .
Cool beans
History is pretty boring , right ? Sure . A bunch of stuff that happened to dead people who didn't even know what a computer was . Woo hoo .
All I'll need to do is ask old people about their lives , and measure how many of them regret certain things ! This " regret index " will range from 0 ( no regret ) to 1 ( total ultimate regret ) . With it , I can tell kids today that if you rub spider eggs into your eyes , you're 96 % likely to regret it , but if you drink delicious lemonade and pop wheelies , the regret index on that is near 0 !
Okay , honestly , it's because they're both catastrophically terrible flavours of ice cream I invented and keep trying again thinking they'll get better but each time it's like WOW , NOPE
It is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE that happened .
Ok , how about " It may be possible to run away from your problems , but under some circumstances - including but not limeted to sentient , mobile friggin' problems - they'll follow you . "
Why yes . What of it ?
Okay , Dromiceiomimus ! Here is the best joke ever for you . It's way better than all other jokes .
What's in your emergency kit , T - Rex ? Mine's got water , food , first aid stuff , matches and scissors !
Hey , what do you have against singer / poetsmith Leonard Cohen ?
" At least I don't have to buy my friends ! "
You're not allowed to heckle !

What's his story ?
Oh gosh , why would you show me that right now , Utahraptor ! ! Oh gosh oh nnoooaghblfg
Ebenezer , I am the Ghost of Christmas Past !
Oh , I am so SCARED ! Please do not read the next panel . PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE !
Maaaaaan SCREW GHOSTS , I don't need this hassle
I mean , my ankle still hurts , but I was looking up doctors in the area and there's so many that have awesome names . There's a Doctor Plumber ! And a Doctor Dinner ! A Doctor SENSIBLE .
The technology means the end of all privacy , but also the end of most violent crime . . .
Yes , the future is indeed a strange and unusual place
Why ? What , does he dress all in black and prank another spy dressed all in white ?
Wait .
WEDNESDAY :
Hee , it's true ! It's the same argument , but since the future doesn't exist yet , nobody can really argue with me about it one way or the other !
One day Batman was like , man , I keep running in circles with these stupid criminals I fight . I need to fight SMARTER , not harder !
It's a normal day in space ! All is well aboard the most colossal and well - appointed of the Galacto - Civ starship fleet , the fair and lovely USS . . .
However , just because a case is between two extremes does not make it automatically correct ! It must be JUSTIFIED .
I'm sorry , T - Rex , but we feel you're not the best qualified application for this position .
So what's your Utahraptor simulator like ?
Oh man ! Is it Mars ? It's Mars , isn't it ? ?
The Devil , come quick ! !
The answer is " no " , T - Rex !
It is a sweet deal .
NEVERMIND
SOCIETY ADVANCES .
Hey , T - Rex ! I wanted to ask you a question !
I'm consumed by this pretty neato lady .
Let's not do that last one
It's okay ! Jealousy is the natural reaction .
Well , I drew up a picture where there's an arrow pointing to a room , and then it says 'holodeck' on the arrow , so - yes ?
LUCKILY , T - REX DISCOVERS A SURE - FIRE WAY TO TURN $ 295 . 95 INTO QUICK MARITAL BLISS !
There are skid marks in front of the skunk ! Hey , what's the definition of a gentleman ?
The focus on partying appeals , though !
I'm not !
Oh my god , nobody is more sex - positive than me ! Watch this :
FINE , give me a copy !
Why not call her now ?
- where'd it come from ? Who made it ? ?
And I made some great friends and did some cool things . Eventually , one of these things I did was to write a book about them . And that brings us up to the present !
Also inanimate objects can be pals .
( This makes me super important ! )
So BASICALLY in the story there's all this build up about this kid whose parents named her Crime and how she grows into her name and becomes this big arch - criminal ! The cops are powerless to stop her , even the really really good ones . ESPECIALLY the really really good ones . Anyway it's narrated in the third person and at the end of the book Crime goes out on a few dates with the narrator and then he abruptly stops writing because he's all cheezed at her . The end !
WHEN YOU WANT TO SHOW POSSESSION ON A PLURAL NOUN THAT ENDS WITH AN S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE APOSTROPHE AFTER THE S OTHERWISE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND INSTEAD OF PLENTY OF THEM

" Antonio Tony remembered he didn't murder anyone ! "
You know how at the office when there's casual Fridays , and you look forward to it all week ? What if it was casual Friday every day ? And rather than going into work , you straight - up had cool sex instead ?
ONLY ALL THE TIME
oh ! OH .
We need some gender - neutral pronouns , like , yesterday !
Hey , quit stomping on things !
What about Gone With The Friggin' Wind , Casa - Friggin' - Blanca , and It's A Friggin' Wonderful Life ?
Also true !
When I start reading a panel and it changes suddenly , I feel like I am being punished for not reading fast enough .
Okay , good
- but that is just level one of pun ! I'm also pointing to my ear and saying " here " , so there's level two ( a visual pun ! ) and level THREE is how " here " sounds like " hear " and you can use ears to hear things . I'll play it by " hear " , i . e . , by how I hear it ! It is a PERFECT STORM of wordplay , Dromiceiomimus ! They make movies out of perfect storms .
What is the meaning of life ? By this I mean , how should I best live my life ?
You , the dude reading this comic over someone else's shoulder ! !
Man , I don't want to swallow knives ! That's DANGEROUS .
Yes ! I can't even vocalize my own self - obsessed musings because I'm suddenly afraid of what the Dromiceiomimus might think !
APPARENTLY , even Willy T . Shakespeare himself used " they " this way !
My Fair Lady , yeah !
The wings arrive soon : a corporation has given me its word !
Why should I even bother stomping this house ? It's just going to get rebuilt .
So now we live in a world of QUANTIFIED FRIENDSHIP , Dromiceiomimus . A world of almost involuntary HARD NUMBERS added to what was previously just a vague impression . Did you know I'm less popular than the guy who invented the phrase " butt stuff " ?
Buy some food for me while I'm at it . Write a letter to my Grandmother whom I love dearly . Laundry !
I can tell because all the cookies are gone , but you left behind anything with vegetables in it !
You probably did , my friend !
Dinosaurs were also known to destroy human LIFE with impunity !
And she as gobbled by smaller animals and left no trace ?
That's where everything runs itself !
For example , say we land a manned mission on Mars . If you're not on Twitter the INSTANT the collected children of Earth achieve this dream with " . @ NAMEOFASTRONAUT : you don't have to go to # Mars for deals like this ! ! " then you are not doing your job correctly .
The answer ?
THIS IS NO ACCIDENT
This belittles us both !
Today is a good day I think for trying to explore THE VERY LIMITS OF MY OWN BODY .
Folks are always all , " What's the best form of government ? DEMOCRACY . I love democracy , a bloo bloo bloo " .
Done and DONE !
T - Rex ! Were you going to tell me fake stories ?
Sleepwalking ! I would like to get me some sleepwalking , please . And more than just sleepwalking !
Worse , what if they bury me in an UNCOOL part of the graveyard ?
CONCLUSION :
Baloney ! You don't even have a console that can run it .
That's one Batman every 25 MILLION YEARS , assuming every billionaire has a child each year . And is murdered each year . And I didn't even work in the odds of becoming friends with Superman . Frig !
Precisely ! ! Unfortunately , my theory can only be proven true when this time traveller dude brags about it . So time traveller dudes , please feel free to come back in time and brag to me !

No way . NO WAY .
You see the T - Rex , stomping a house . There is a Dromiceiomimus here .
That's super cool !
I'd use my other two wishes as damage control , T - Rex
Well , when you find some teens , be sure to let them know your new slang !
STILL . You're wandering around a hollow tube with a box around your head to give the illusion of an endless horizon . It's SO SAD .
Since it's the center of the universe , it can't help but be eternal . And we also have our cultural milieu , which informs us that the world we live in is eternal and unchanging . Sure , there's suffering , but we can work towards changing that . We've got time !
Really ? BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY FOR SURE ? ?
THE AMAZING STORY OF EDWARD S . CURTIS . Edward S . Curtis was a photographer of American Indians in the early 1900s ! I know he was tough because his middle name was " Sheriff " .
Holy crap ! I DO
" Maybe we can playfully splash water at each other ? "
Holy cow ! We should go fly kites !
If you ever come across a hole in the ground that water comes out of , you can legally call that hole a " spring " and NO POLICE OFFICER IN ANY JURISDICTION THE WORLD OVER WILL BE ABLE TO STOP YOU !
First off : dog breederies , solar panel processing plants , and giant cubes !

Hahaha ! You're going down , little woman !
Pfft !
So yeah ! I can see wanting to be respected but not wanting to be remarkable - it almost seems nobler than otherwise .
I don't see why you're making fun of Doug !
Or DELICIOUS MEAT tree !
VICTORIAN TIMES :
Sherlock Holmes , the world's greatest detective , was stumped . He considered the case carefully and deduced that there was only one possible conclusion :
Man ! " Reality " , am I right ? ?
I'll stick with Dinosaurese , thanks !
Sure ! I'll make enlargements for everyone !
Everyone ? Why , THAT'S JUST WHAT I EXPECTED !
DIRECTED PANSPERMIA . That doesn't sound like the origin of life on earth ! That sounds like a CRAZY FRIDAY NIGHT .
She ended up married , I think .
I honestly don't see an audience for this .
While I do feel this project has brought us closer together , I don't think it's going to work . Perhaps faster - than - light travel really is impossible .
Chicka wikka woop woop BOOP !
Really , it's insurance in case he doesn't make it back . The march isn't going to be easy !
Excellent ! And , attached to the flowers , a note ?
HOW DID YOU KNOW
You did not walk up to Dromiceiomimus , warm her up with religious proselytising , and then smoothly segue into sex junk .
We both know I'm always down for swimming , T - Rex , but isn't that a bit - mercenary ?
Holy crap . We could be reliving the same few moments over and over and have NO IDEA .
Right , right !
I woke up this morning and found out that there's a new fancy building going up downtown and GUESS WHAT EVERYBODY : they named it after me !
T - REX in " Dinosaur Comics "
Some people believe that you can come back as plants ! They're BARELY alive .
But it's not exactly the same , right ? It's not like , if you do go outside the diamond then you die , right ? And then if you die in the game you die in real life ? ?
Frig Dromiceiomimus , I locked myself out ! My keys AND everything else I own is trapped in a housethat , thanks to my thoughlessness , I no longer have access to ! !
Old people are the worst drivers .
CONGRATULATIONS , YOU NOW HAVE NO EXCUSES NOT TO HAVE BOATS IN EVERY STORY YOU WRITE

Impossible to say .

METHOD 2 : SAYING " I'VE MET SOMEONE NEW "
Our next letter comes from Kat ! Kat writes , " Dear Professor , how is energy released from the atoms in a nuclear bomb ? "
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD MY FRIEND T - REX ABOUT SANDWICHES
MR . TUSKS HAS BEEN MADE MAYOR OF TINY TOWNE !
DON'T DO IT
And maybe some of these friends would write down the stories . And then set up stores to sell them . " Book " " stores " , if you will ! T - Rex : YOU ALREADY LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE STORIES HAVE VALUE . You've paid for them !
THE FRIGGIN' INTERNET .
So what you do is tap someone on the head between the eyes and above the nose ! They'll reflexively blink each time you tap them until they get wise to you game , at which point they'll suppress the reflex and the blinking will stop . But until then , THEIR EYELIDS ARE AT YOUR MERCY . YOU CONTROL SOMEONE ELSE'S EYELIDS WITH YOUR MEREST WHIM .
Well , anything that can't reproduce and ages would die out , right ?
Sherlock Holmes adjusted a few gears , tightened a few springs , then brushed off his hands . He'd finally completed his greatest invention yet . . .
Okay , but now you're stepping on one !
Oh phew what a relief
Plus , you'll be all hairy and like tummy rubs !
That IS attractive !
The worst part of owning a cape is having to find excuses to wear it .
But DID YOU KNOW that dentists only clean your teeth and hang out with you because you pay them to ?
We enter a world where the internet never got invented . Broadcast media , like fries , rules supreme !
Hello , everybodee !

No it doesn't !
Sorry , LADIES !
I GOT ISSUES WITH THIS GUY
SO YEAH , MOVING SOUNDS REAL FUN , COUNT ME IN
24 HOURS AGO :
It IS !
Aw , T - Rex , come on . Why would a " by - the - books " cop team up with a criminal ?
The word ?
NO MORE PROCRASTINATING
I gotta say , I'm not feeling especially public serviced !
And he realized the way Poison Ivy got plants to do things for her was pretty smart ! !
O . A . C . stands for " on approved credit " ! Everyone's approved if they're approved ? ! Aaargh !
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !
I'm just trying to get a leg up !
The only downside is that the Dromiceiomimus won't be able to come .
If you had a good set of common phrases , you could really speed things up !
I'd definitely be WAY more into concrete if they named it LIQUID ROCK . Sheesh .
Well ! May I be the first to say :
Pfft , pretty big assumption that they're even physical . Suddenly you can PROVE we're not all computer simulations ?

T - Rex , you're forgetting about Babbage engines !
I missed the " car chases are necessary in every great movie today " memo !
Tricky
I'm totally pumped for the party tonight , T - Rex !
My fantasies also involved pirates .
Basically , the idea is that if a species gets to an island and is then isolated , it can evolve on its own , apart from what's happening on the rest of the planet . And if food supplies are limited , as they often are on islands , smaller individuals have an evolutionary advantage since they need less food to live ! If the larger species survives at all , it usually survives by shrinking .
Wait a second , WAIT A SECOND . That's not Shakespeare , that's Tennyson ! ! Facebook Shakespeare , are you actually a GIANT FRAUD ? ?
I don't see how you're go -
Oh sure ! MY ADVICE : turn around , leave , NEVER COME BACK . Go do fun stuff with friends you've already got ! ! Oh man , that sounds great !
They do define who can procreate .
Finding ways to wish for more wishes is like computer hacking ( looking for oversights in systems ) combined with linguistics ( talking with words or whatever ) and those are like my two major interests ! YOU CAN'T KEEP ME OUT .

It's a tragic flaw of our characters that we don't share as often , or as equally , as we should .
Rebuilt again , eh ? I'll have to make a note of that , in my LOGS !
CLINICAL DEPRESSION !
Well , what are YOU doing here , if we have nothing to talk about ?
Then I'm sure nobody will mind when I'm at the awards ceremony , making a big deal of my way more awesome prize !
Ah yes , seaspeak , otherwise known as the Standard Marine Communication Phrases ! A set of simple English words and phrases , designed to facilitate communication on the open seas between speakers of disparate languages , where otherwise it might be difficult or impossible !

For example , you could become a piano prodigy at any point in your life ! You may ALREADY be born with the innate talent required , ready to spill out the moment you sit down and try to play . And you could do that whenever - even when living in an old folks home !
DEFINITELY YES .
You're saying -
Only that's crazy ! That's COMPLETELY CRAZY . The grass is green and the sky is blue , sure , but the sun isn't YELLOW . It's white . It's like , the DEFINITION of white light .
You're always just picking two temperatures and dividing the space between up into arbitrary degrees ! We could just as easily be dealing with the freezing and boiling points of a 50 / 50 mixture of champagne and caviar , say .
The man who does not jerk it has no advantage over the man who cannot jerk it !
Not much ! I bought a new patio set !
Someone who is able to lead well , but also is able to admit and correct their mistakes .
The PROBLEM is that I define myself in terms of not having glasses ! People are always " Oh . You're lookng for T - Rex ? He's the green tyrannosaurus rex over there ! You'll be able to spot him because he's so not wearing glasses . "
Oh ! Really ? I thought you were going to say " only if you don't stop the rock " and I was going to assure you that TRY AS ONE MAY , one simply cannot stop the rock .
Again ?
Well they sound great .
I have no input of value relative to this specific situation .
YOU GUYS NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME MORE SURPRISING STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE GREAT
NOTHING .
And it's intense . Songs are prose and music mashed up together , and people weep at poetry , right ? I think that's a thing . Anyway , it's poetry set to MUSIC .
Me ! Glasses !
That's exactly what we get to decide !
T - Rex , come on , this is ultra dumb .
With that in mind , I have started a new religion : Buddhism 2 !
She's torn between her desire for Gandhian passive resistance and her desire to punch her way to a unilaterally imposed solution ! ! She's a conflicted hero for a conflicted age , you guys !

I feel today that my actions will be charged with symbolism .
What If . . . All Dinosaurs Were Stand - Up Comedians ?
So ? ?
So stop searching the dregs !
He'd watch videos of people bringing pets on planes and literally COULD NOT BELIEVE what happened next : his opinions as to what had happened were the platonic form of scepticism : perfect , universal . He would read Eleven Facts About Cats You'll Never Forget and HE WOULD TAKE THOSE FACTS TO HIS GRAVE . His faith in humanity was being destroyed and restored on THE REGULAR .
Dromiceiomimus , party at my place tonight ! Can you come ?
I'll ask if you want the last piece of pie before I take it , but again : that's just me selfishly wanting friends and knowing that actually showing my greediness impedes that . Otherwise I'd be gobbling it like crazy !
Guns ! Folks buy guns when they want the ability to point at something and make that something have a hole in it .
I'd be careful with that , T - Rex . . . nostalgia can be a powerful drug !
We choose a FUTURE interesting time , experiment all we want , and then go back to the present and present the results .
I DARE YOU TO SAY UTAHRAPTOR DID YOU KNOW I TOOTED THE BED
And then he'd eat a chocolate ?
Chris and Nat : two teens always competing in school for the highest grades ! Then , one day , as Chris was blowing out his candles on his birthday cake , he wished that , from now on , he would always know more than Nat .

A governess can also be a female governor !
So ! Life proceeds , despite the fact that I've got the freakiest neighbors ever . Who wants to live next door to sinister raccoons and cephalopods ?
That's pretty sweet , T - Rex ! But you don't think you'd get tired of it ? Eventually ?
So this is like a skill people develop ?
I choose not to !
They stand outside our homes , businesses , and critical infrastructure with their frozen eyes , watching us even as they melt .

Well , a rose by any other name -

Implications are tricky so maybe
Let us totally assume that it's safe to eat chalk ! !

Here I go , Here I go , here I go again ! Girls , what's my weakness ?
UtahraptOR , UtahraptAND . Hah hah . No , I was gonna go more in a UtahSLOWJAMStor / UtahRAPtor direction . I'm hoping some other friend will change their name to it for me . My birthday is coming up ! !
I don't know . A lot ? They're alright .
I PROMISE
In Hinduism , there are many gods and aspects of gods , and many of these divinities are sexual . It's true ! Some even have sex in the woods with regular mortals just for the fun of it ! In conclusion , Hinduism is a famous religion , plus , sexual congress .
What's lame ? We've just totally faked out the Turing test and all it required was near infinite storage space ! Brute force : the approach of kings and the king of approaches ?
Man !
I've got a great domain name for you !
Indeed ! Now I'd like for my ashes to be hurled backwards through TIME ITSELF , to be mixed into the primordial ooze from which we all came . YES . My final wish is for all life to have developed either in or about my earthly remains .
I haven't made any yet !
Submit it to me , youngster !
I'm walking , talking , respirating , circulating blood , transforming light AND sound into electrical signals , converting electricity into thoughts , AND maintaining awareness of the position of my body , all at the same time ! !
Aw man , these all sound disgusting !
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
T - REX's CANDIDATE :
Oh , Dad !
God damn it , you're making everyone angry . Why are you even doing this in the first place ?
Why do we even have pain sensors inside our chests ? Why would we evolve to feel pain in the first place ? Why can't I just get a text message inside my head that says " oh hey your heart is boned " and I can click " whatever , I had a good run " and we leave it at that ?
Maybe even a joke that was just alright ?
No , really ! They're dry and salty .
That way , years down the road if he ever chances to mention one of these stories , I will be able to say , " Got you ! "
I think you are an unfortunate victim without recourse of CURRENCY CRIME , my friend !

There's an average life expectancy for people born when and where you were ! Look it up and you'll know how long the Average You will live !
COME ON EVERYONE WHO'S ANYONE IS TOTALLY MARRIED
I have friends because I like them and I like them because they're fun and GUESS WHAT , I LOVE HAVING FUN .
About science ?
Anyway , I'll tell him you said " hi " !
But I'm just sayin' : utahraptoids have the # 1 highest brain to body mass ration . Yeah , we're BASICALLY just these colossal brains walking around on KILLER CLAW FEET . No big deal , T - Rex .
IF AUSTRALIA EVER GETS TAKEN BY SUPERINTELLIGENT APES THEN I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR THE FLIPPANT TONE OF THIS COMIC
No it doesn't
" Well , um " exactly !
Europe is like that , but with skeletons .
I'll simply assume I didn't have anything important to do today !
So each " you " meets at the intersection of irreplacible and fragile , and there is no recourse .
ONE - STOP SHOPPING , BAYBEE .
I wrote a script that turns all : ) into ; ) and HEY PRESTO , suddenly people are waaay more suggestive with me . Especially in ways I don't understand , but am interesting in finding out more about !
Hey Dromiceiomimus , have you noticed the arts lately ? I have , and as a patron , I find them to be very engaging AND artistic . . . on SEVERAL levels .
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR , BUT I GUESS I SHOULD ANSWER HER QUESTION . I figure our innermost thoughts are kept privae too often , so I've decided to shout mine to the world !
That's right , Dromiceiomimus ! Even though we have totally spent naked times together , it turns out we're related ! WHOAH !
What about LOVE ?
Primitivism is the artistic and cultural idea that prehistorical and tribal societies were , and are , better that modern societies .
Yesterday was a very special day for many people !
Elizabeth doesn't fall in love with him for no reason !
FIRST HAND :
What's with mainstream music nowadays ? It's all so BAD . If I wanted facile lyrics , I would just write them myself and make sure not to try very hard !
Maybe they'd be called kuppies ? ?
Hah hah , you hate babies !
You can't realign your perceptions back ?
Another good tip is to only buy one colour of socks !
It's email that's so fun you say " weeee ! " and give a thumbs up when you read it ! I just sent the first weemail ever : " weee - d ( ^ _ ^ d ) "
This is a pretty thin miracle so far .

So while still working out the particulars , they'd publish the basics of their ideas IN SECRET CODE . Robert Hooke's published his law of elasticity as " ceiiinosssttuv " . And Newton wrote a letter to his chum Leibniz where he was all " 6accdae13eff7i2l9n4o4qrr4s8t12ux " , which uses numbers to represent how often the letters appear , and which , unencoded , is the Latin version of , oh , I don't know , HIS FUNDAMENTAL THEORY OF CALCULUS ? ?
Liquid heresy !
To her .
HEY AN AUDIENCE MEMBER HAS SOME OPINIONS HE'D LIKE TO SHARE
I wish I wouldn't either !
That's not very helpful , is it ? You're just adding the same adverb over and over again !

An unreliable narrator is when Shakespeare tells you that his play Hamlet is pretty good , but then at the end Hamlet wakes up and he's on a friggin' bus .
Ahhh , I get what you're saying ! My mug broke because its kinetic energy derived from gravitational potential energy was converted into an impact force beyond the mug's ability to withstand , but the precise values of those calculations are way mysterious until I run the numbers .
It sucks , but you have to do it at least sometimes !
It's called . . .

Oh ! Hah ! MY MISTAKE .
My dog ran away by his own free will !
Because the planet spins , the earth's liquid core acts as a dynamo , generating a magnetic field ! And magnetism is a force that can do work , but at our current rotational speed we only get about 60 microteslas of force , which ISN'T MUCH .
I'm a ruffian with a heart of gold ! Are there any sensual socialites on board ?
They're what lightsabers or Green Lantern " hard light " constructs will be made out of , if we ever get around to inventing them . THE END .

Then I roll over to my laptop and check my email .
I SHOUTED TOO MUCH AND MY VOICE GOT STUCK THIS WAY
It's totally true , even if all the messages arrive unmolested !

Some say dedicating your life to helping others is the key .
GOODBYE , STRANGER ! WE SHALL NEVER MEET AGAIN ! ESPECIALLY NOT IN AN ALLEYWAY I CALL " THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ZONE " !

" I kiss my money sometimes , not because I love money , but because I love T - Rex . " the other person would reply .
That'd be THE WEIRDEST !

" I guess we forgot all about that once we started making other people's boobs bigger " is actually the most true sentence I've ever said
So , I have to say I love you

It's put into action in the event that Plan B fails . ONLY IT'S NEVER BEEN USED BECAUSE PLAN B NEVER FAILS ! !
You " know " it !
What's that , the library is closed ? Well , FRRRRIIIIII -
It's probably not the cheeriest moral I have ever encountered .
Dromiceiomimus ! Listen , I have a question for you : would you rather kiss a music student , or a psychology student ?
Aww ! You're cuter as a butterfly .
Dude , trees are metal as friggin' giant robots MADE OF LITERAL METAL . You know plants didn't evolve photosynthesis , right ? They stole it via BODY MODIFICATION . Microscopic blue - green algae evolved the trait , so plant life just straight - up ENGULFED them . Sucked up the algae into their own cells , absorbed their abilities , and BOOM : photosynthesis plants . The chloroplast in plant cells today is a deformed , degraded remnant of that bacteria .
Honestly , I think it would be more fun if you WEREN'T such a boy !
Okay , well : I understand where you're coming from , Utahraptor .

While that WOULD likely be more fun to talk about , I am instead referring to the idea of a person who acts externally like a real , sentient person , but who actuall lacks consciousness . A mental zombie ! A philosophical zombie .

But not just Precise Lee , he can be Compelling Lee , Obliging Lee - even Furious Lee ! But the catch is , the cards stick out , so enemies know what they're dealing with . " Oh cool , we're dealing with Conclusive Lee " , they'll say . " We can ask him some questions . "

Philosophical zombies ? Do you mean like a zombie Plato or Ayn Rand or something ?
Knowledge is power !
Sometimes i worry that if I were someone else , I wouldn't want to be friends with me .
One day John Spidderman was leaving work when he took a look overhead and saw Spider - Man swinging by from a thread .

Depending on when in their lives this happens , the " OH MY GOD " that escapes your lips could be one of the deepest sympathy OR terrific excitement !
T - Rex , you're on trial for stomping on hundreds of tiny women . Court is now in session .

Can you get mom to wear her pearl necklace ?
The web is full of links , but there's no way I'm going to visit them all . So who's to say those pages actually exist ? Maybe they're just there to fake me out and give me the IMPRESSION we built a dang ol' world wide web !

It appears I have finished decorating my house !
Not really I guess
What's the deal with this " American Thanksgiving " holiday you invented , T - Rex ?
Hah hah ! The ghost of Zach , right ? Aw , poor Zach .
That's still awesome , right ? It seems that 10 years ago people were more into rock stars and being rock stars than they are now . But I am a rock star and it is my job to sing rock songs on stage and in CD players ! !
okay
Okay , I think I get it !
Oh crap ! Did you forget not to be single this year ? Did that just plain slip your mind , champ ?
They think they're so great just because they talk about the future all day long . Ooh , look at me ! I think that the future will have Internet robot nano - maids ! Put me on the news ! " Anyone can call themselves a futurist : it doesn't mean anything !
Also : we could slingshot a probe around Earth EVERY DAY for a million years and still not get that free holiday , so don't hold your breath .
10 ) vomit
Yeah , when an obituary gets run prematurely , it's always for someone famous !
Like when I lost someone's baby !
I hate to be the one to talk about this , but it's time for us to talk about -
In conversations , speakers generally try to make helpful contributions , and listeners generally assume that this is the case ! This is called the " cooperative principle " , and philosopher Paul Grice proposed it ! He's dead now .
Dromiceiomimus , I am so happy that we live in a place and time that will soon permit bike rides !
But what if I . . . dressed up like a flapper , and said " Here's the news ? "
While she does not predate chickens , my mother has laid eggs , yes .
And he'd be so good at licking himself that he'd never have to take a bath .
In summary , life is too fragile and I describe that as " sucks ahoy " !
Actually , I might go up north for a bit .
This will prevent you from writing yourself into a corner , where for example all your characters are in a desert shack when you need your boat to appear , which will then save you several chapters of your characters agreeing that when that boat rammed through the wall they all thought it made sense , and any third parties who heard tell of this and disagreed were simply not considering the matter closely enough .
Something that'll make them wonder and fear the power of the ancients !
Because , as you know , there's nothing preventing you from drinking earlier except the unexamined idea that laws invented by other people are worth observing .
" Oh , you'll grow out of that ! "
Maybe some meat - themed frozen confection ?
So what's the language like ?
Oh GOD , yes .
I WAS WALKING BY AND COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING . You're all " here's an example of an awkward pause ! " but then set her up to say exactly what you want ! Also it didn't even work , because nobody wants chlorinated water in their eyes on a date .
I imagine a lone samurai who never speaks ( BUT WHO SECRETLY CAN ) and who can explode if needed . So badass !

Cowboy hat dude got DECIMATED !
So awesome . A spark plug found inside a geode , surrounded by material that would have taken 500 , 000 years to collect ! Is this truly CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that we will one day visit the distant past , and drop spark plugs in sediment while we're at it ? I would argue " Definitely , dudes ! " I would argue that there can be no other explanation and I would argue that it's gonna be great .
Welp , guess I'll go help Dromiceiomimus rebuild that log cabin or whatever
In poker , you have a hand full of cards , and everyone else has a hand full of cards , and you all just have to deal with that .
Seeing things 45 milliseconds before than every other living thing means that , for all intents and purposes , you can see the future . You can react to things before anyone else is even aware they've happened !

Holy crap Utahraptor , that's a great title ! Listen : what is your position on plagiarism ?
Oh no . Dude . You're PLAGIARIZING WIKIPEDIA in your MARTY MCFLY WEREWOLF FANFIC .
And I don't want to find out ! You'd think that anything that could be invented has already been PRETTY MUCH COVERED .
A closely related problem is the formula satisfiability problem , SAP , which can be mapped one - to - one , and in linear time , to the circuit satisfiability problem .
That's why ghosts appear to us only to wail and scream ! They're desperately trying to escape the zombie apocalypse WE put down forgotten ages ago buy which rages on in the afterlife , fueled as it is by a constant supply of confused and unprepared fresh meat !

But this sentence is just gonna be something random anyway . Why not choose a random sentence from your diary and avoid , um , THE NEED TO LIVE IN A SURVELLIANCE STATE THAT RECORDS EVERY SINGLE SPEECH ACT ?
Lame !
My favourite food is avocado sandwiches ! They're fatty but teally really delicious . I also like orange juice .
Perhaps I can get insight into myself by , instead of examining what I know , looking at what I DON'T know ! For example , I don't know anything about what happened in 1900 BCE .
Why not just give it away ?
I don't know - a few dollars ?
But what makes you think you're so prepared ?
You sure took your sweet time getting here ! That's ok , we'll take the leisurely route . Suits me just fine .
Then his brain started transforming into a dog brain , which was unable to sustain many of his higher functions , including those resposible for memory and language . Anyway , yeah , it was horrible .
LATER , T - REX CHECKS WIKIPEDIA :
Yes ! It is now a day to give thanks AND wear stylish outmoded fashions .
Something ! ANYTHING . We're awesome AND we have disposable income - why do we have dull evenings ? Why aren't we taking helicopter rides to the grocery store ? Why aren't we WHITE WATER RAFTING into our friggin' jobs ?
DUDES . What have we accomplished ?
OH DAMN !
MEANWHILE , AT THE MAILBOX :

YOU ARE KILLING ME
I KNOW ; I'M SO EXCITED ! !
Dromiceiomimus , how come you never send me any emails ?
INITIALLY THERE'S PORNS
So I looked into it and every band formed in the past decade was named after me ! Heck , there's even a handful of COUNTRIES that were named after me . Plus , you know every single dog alive today ? I don't want to alarm you , but every one of those dogs was named after me too !
T - Rex , that service has been available for a while now .
My greatest fear is having superpowers and not realizing it !

There's a big snowstorm coming tonight . This is so great ! By tomorrow morning , everything will be buried under snow , and society will have finally reached its snowmageddon .
I dunno . Probably because it's awesome !
TRY ALL 40 , 000 VARIETIES

Which dude spent their weekend painting themselves into all the famous works of art ?
dinosaurs haven't been discovered yet
You know I don't ! !
Meat party !
And this is great , because this gives us DATA POINTS . If miracles are really just tricks , you'd expect miracles to drop off as we move towards a more savvy , skeptical , technologically - informed society ! But if they're REAL , then it seems reasonable to assume that the baseline worldwide miracle rate would remain just about constant . So with our hypothesis , we can SCIENCE !
And then I would like my carbon remains to be crushed into diamonds , please !
Yep ! It specifies divorce penalties but ALSO marital vows , and is hung up in the house . Prenups can mean a lot of different things to people !
LATER , PITCHING A TV SHOW :
The Ultimate Song is , objectively , the best song . We all thought it was impossible - that music was too varied , tastes too wide - for one song to be universally the best , but whether by chance or by design , it now exists . All other songs suffer in comparison . There is a brief artistic movement obsessed with flaws , imperfections , but that only gets us so far . We keep coming back to the song : it's perfect . Why would we listen to anything else ?
Yeah , I followed that .
It's like Batman : you need to have a singular focus on training since childhood to pull off such elite performance , and none of us did ! But these singers and musicians DID have that drive and training . Once I realized opera singers were Music Batmen I got really into it .
Ah , I see you've studied this before !
Hah hah ! WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT ! !
I'd say that's fair !
Players only love you when they're playing ! ! ! PLEASE RT

There's only four panels , no little people , no dromiceiomimus , and we look all different ! Everything's changed !

And it occurs to me that time travel will revolutionize the social sciences !
This theory is called " panspermia " !
We'll see about THAT !
how's that ?
But I feel like everyone - all of us - could have done so much then , if only we handn't spent so many nights at home watching a movie or sitting in front of a computer !
FINE . Someone shouts " Whoah , now she's pulling off her face , and there's a writhing pile of worms underneath ! "
A sassy cat from space who carries a crossbow PLUS has all those earlier properties too ! That's my " Sassy Space Cat " character sketch , Dromiceiomimus ! He's available for the role of title protagonist ONLY .

Aw no ! Seriously ?
My book is called " Happy Dog the Happy Dog " and it mixes the story of Happy Dog with important lessons I've chosen about life ! It also features adorable drawings of happy dogs . Amazing !
I guess so ! !
I just can't figure out these . . . these Dinosaur Comics .
Looks like THIS timeline's turning out okay after all !
Plus air is free so WHATEVER ! !
EXCELLENT
A WEREWOLF TALE OF TERROR , by me , T - Rex .
So your story is Hamlet only with explosions instead of punctuation .
HOWEVER ! I DO HAVE MANY UNSOLICITED OPINIONS ON SMALLER , LOCAL ISSUES !
Whoops ! Turns out , it's not !
OH MY GOSH that's the best name EVER . Well , looks my afternoon just got filled up !
Maybe 100 years from now people will look back on us and say " MAN I can't believe they permitted lifestyles different than my own , current lifestyle . Sheesh ! "
USE THESE LINES TO PICK UP PEOPLE YOU MEET
A new religion is just a few words away ! Dromiceiomimus ! I feel the same craziness I would feel if I discovered that , I don't know - I could change my GENDER by just reciting a sentence or so . Crazy with POWER !
Yeah . . . full of Internet robot nano - maids !
Oh well !
And man , imagine a pure white bird , a father of two baby chicks , lying dead and motionless on the sidewalk , killed because it flew into an office window ? That's SUPER sad !
Damn it , English ! We need to close the compound noun gap ! !
But that's totally awful !
This summarized the plot thus far perfectly !
Hah hah ! Assuming people choose their shopping establishments by pun quality , I am truly set !
You seem to have a lot of respect for dentists !
I've never seen the world , but that's going to change . . .
We end with an unpredictable snow golem disrespecting all authority , police or otherwise !
" Having investigated the very best murders of our time , I start committing them myself ! My former colleagues investigate but find nothing , and then I murder them too until there's not even one investigator left , and all our nation's teens are going into engineering instead of police sciences because they're no fools . "
Ah , so you use the characters to finally give Clark Kent the quiet and stable relationship with Lois he could never have as Superman .
It's just - I don't really know what it sounds like yet
Then what ?
I'm a big fan of sex .
My dentist is more of a - supervisor , you know ? I check in with him once a year and he gives me some pointers . Then , I pay him for the pointers .
You know T - Rex , you sure are using the word 'awesome' a lot . Is your vocabulary really that limited ?
MAYBE that waitress brought you a free dessert because you're easy on the eyes , not because you're actually a nice person who truly deserves a fudgie brownie chocsplosion ! Maybe that stranger offered you their seat not out of basic kindness and decency , but because they liked your handsomeness . How could you be certain of the sincerity of ANY interaction ?
Santa wrote me back ! !
BUT THEN , INSPIRATION ! A PERFECT SOLUTION FOR ENDLESS JOY !
What day is it ? It's December now , isn't it ?
So someone looking in would see us frozen in time ! Whoah !
YOU'RE NOT AS BADASS AS SHARKS
JUST SAYIN'
EVERYONE GET OFF THE TRAIN , I GOTTA FIGURE THIS OUT
Aren't pointers programming tools , T - Rex ?
So what's your spy's name ?
EACH OF US HAS ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF DAYS IN OUR TOO BREIF LIVES ; NONE KNOW HOW MANY OR HOW FEW THEY HAVE LEFT BEFORE DEATH , AS IT MUST , COMES TO US ALL
Yeah , that's what I thought !
It speeds up reading AND comprehension , and spelling errors give editors " easy points " when looking for something to edit . FINE . But we've lost the ability to encode the way words are spoken : the pronunciation and accents of a speaker ! We can get a little of that back through capitalization and creative ! punctuation ! but still - it's hard in text to tell an Australian from an American , assuming they're both speaking English .
METAPHORICALLY .
What for ?
In times of trouble , I am there , as SUPERMAN !
You don't even know what the word means ! You got it from a song .
I would honestly wear a shirt that says that .
T - Rex , did you ever think that maybe they're just as scared of you as you are of them ?
I believe it is literally impossible to tell !
I KNOW ALL OF THE STUFFS
PS
AS NATURE INTENDED
Attention , enemies !
Ah , merci bien , monsieur !
I'm just throwing that out there . Maybe it's time to gently press some lips together .
Physics does not work this waaaaay
Two ! Folks who dismiss thousands of people out - of - hand based on one quality .
Nothing else needs to change ! Dino doctor finds DNA from extinct dinosaurs , brings 'em back , forgets about chaos theory . It's perfect ! Only instead of everyone in the audience falling asleep when a human shows up just to tell the other humans what a bad idea this was , they're dinosaurs instead .
Dentists are cyberneticists that operate with metal scrapers instead of experimental medical contraband , and the result is cleaner teeth instead of glowing red pupils .
Man ! Georgia ?
It's Stunt Autobiography O'Clock !
WHAT'S FOR DINNER
But our culture is crazy , Dromiceiomimus , because I can't just give you a URL as a gift . No matter how much you'd like it !
Unless . . . !
And to stop you from finding it , I hid it well within my house : it's INSIDE THE WALLS , dude . I haven't touched it since I put it there , safe and sound , two years ago ! !
That's tricky ?
Outside , a really bad storm raged ! Yikes !
Be sure to enter in things like " ( musicnotes ) ( flowerfancyX _ fancyX ) ( musicnotes ) " or " ( crowndot ) : ( star ) YAAAAAY ( star ) : ( dotcrown ) " because like in all aspects of life , the more your text looks like it's stroking out , the more credible you will appear . And now , if you'll excuse me , I'm off to wonder what I was thinking when i bought a bag of tiny used plastic burgers .
I'm not sure if there exists someone who's SO SAD but also SO CONCERNED WITH BEING COOL . At least , not within the sound of your voice .
I regret - well , it was in grade two , and I was just a little girl , and there was this near - deaf kid in class who had a hearing aid . One day on the playground I walked up to him and moved my mouth like I was talking but I didn't say anything . I just wanted to - I don't know , see if he'd be tricked or something . He wasn't , of course , and wasn't even that upset , but all of a sudden I could see what a jerk I was being . I don't want to be the kind of person who does that .
No dice , dude .
It all comes back to toast !
What the heck , past me ?
Organic matter that they can't kill because IT'S ALREADY DEAD is secreting out of their bodies , and you know what their response is ? They STYLE IT . They say , " oh neat , this dead stuff that INVOLUNTARILY PUSHED ITS WAY OUT OF MY HEAD would look really neato in a bun . "
From yesterday ?
Why isn't anyone attending their classes ? Guys ! Class is on ! It's time to go to class !
Ah , yes , that coveted " I'm so full of chalk and sawdust , you guys " feeling .
SEXY : Your man woke up hungry ? NOT A PROBLEM . Just grab our cereal and watch him swallow what he craves : a non - homogeneous slurry of room - temperature cereal and animal lactates .
EVEN BETTER ! !
It was some of my earliest work on head word tuples !
See ? SEE ?
aw .
It's not gonna happen ! Compromise is settling for something that's not as good as what you wanted .
Well - yeah !
The only way left to learn more was dissection ! So for science , she gave up a source of great personal riches . UNFORTUNATELY , she lived i a world with primitive scientific instruments , and without microscopes and cellular analysis she was unable to discover the production mechanism .
Ha ha , yeah , that sounds good !
Man - - maybe acting like an adult would be nice for a change , recipient of this card !
Furthermore , if I had a machine that I could press a button on , and it would make me happy - perfectly content , indistinguishable from the real emotion - would I do anything but press the button all day long ?
I HAVE BEEN DOING A SPEED RUN FOR THE FIRST MARIO BROTHERS FAME AND I CAN ASSURE YOU MY BEST TIME SO FAR VERGES ON INSANELY FLABBERGASTING
I don't care ! !
We love you even though we're at this fancy dinner party for all the correct people , and all the correct people are there , and you've shown up wearing an inflatable pool ring around your waist . This is a metaphor .
Where is your place of origin , youngster ? By what means were you cognizant of my need for you ?
But it's not all sunshine and roses , Utah - raptor .
Well listen up , chuckles : everyone who emails you deserves a response and it is madness to believe otherwise . But replying to emails is easy ! Simply reply immediately to each email as it comes in with THESE EXACT WORDS : " I hope you find what you're looking for - T - rex " .
TIPS ON FATHERHOOD from a man who has never been a father
TIME IS RUNNING FORWARDS :
I say again : STUPIDEST UNIVERSE EVER .
You're right . I'll just face this way to prevent any unwanted spew contact .
Yeah , but it's ridiculous ! This is you : " Marriage is like Game Boys , only you marry the Game Boys . "
LOTS , probably !
My mood was off for the rest of the day because of it . I was worrying about communities and stuff !
I must request that you give me a break !
ALLUSION
Yes my son ?
What'd they do ?
In fact , I'm pretty sure I'm ALREADY an amazing dentist , you guys !
4 ) earwax
I'm a machine that turns chicken wings into things being stomped on . I turn a who friggen' bag of chips into new ideas about gender relations ! What other new creation ( besides the dinosaurs , OF COURSE ) can turn physical things into abstract ideas ? I'm totally great !
I accidentally drank a love potion !
I believe today I will go down to the beach and swim !
You can Utahraptor something though ! Watch !
Yep ! That would be the end of you !
No thanks , Chuckles !
Man I don't want rando friends ! I want HIM .
I'd lick my lips while I said , " Hello ! "
I guess a lot of it depends on the faith of the people involved , T - Rex !
Forget I said that ! !
I respect their choices and don't fetishize their sexuality at all .
Edgar Allan Poe ! What are YOU doing here ?
You did . If only you'd chosen less terrible words to say .
INDEED IT IS AKIN TO A VIRTUOSO PIANO PERFORMANCE IN EVERY REGARD
It starts like this :
The same thing that happens when I shout " It's raining whooby whabba zoop - zoop " , OKAY ? ?
I can at least save this woman from the damaging UV rays of the noonday sun !
Now I'M the one tripping balls !
I'm not afraid ! ! I'm INFORMED !
So long , Dromiceiomimus ! I'm about to travel back to the age of di - back to long ago !
REALLY , popularity is just the state of having lots of friends . If you wants lots of STRANGERS to like you , you're looking for fame , no popularity . How To Be Famous is in the room down the hall , and you'll recognize it because it's full of non - famous wannabes , OH SNAP .
I am T - Rex . . .
" If you call that 'living' ! "
But all you're getting is one secret , no more !
Yes really . I don't see the paragon of manhood as being able to successfully deliver sperm to the most eggs . It's a very literally biological view of manliness , you know ? I think we as a gender can aim higher .
Holy smokes , but that's a pretty awesome expression ! " That dude just fell down the stairs ! Holy smokes ! " It has the charm of a child , yet is better than the old standby of " holy cow " because nobody says " holy smokes " anymore . It is forgotten . It is UNDISCOVERED .
A WEEK LATER . . .
Yes indeed , life is good !
Our slogan is " Hi , you are probably already a member of our awesome club ! "
AN OVERVIEW OF EUROPEAN TAX REFORMS FROM THE EARLY TO MID - EARLY 1850s
We'd get bored each time we'd try to talk !
But - what if you broke up with them because you didn't love them anymore ?
Not white chocolates .
Okay , so I take a picture of myself with my digital camera put it on my computer , and then digitally alter it . I make it appear like I'm snow - boarding or meeting famous people or something ! Something that is at least PLAUSIBLE .
What if I want bananas though ?
But what if I have only good things to say about them , hmm ? What about THAT ?
I'M HERE TO RAP ABOUT BEING GOD / SO EVERYBODY HERE BEST PREPARE TO GET AWED
Vitamin B12 : What is it ?
I CRACKED THE CODE , you know ?
Did you realize that you just laughed at somebody's house , car , + kid !
Haha , TRUE , but your body has some involuntary responses : if it gets cold , you shiver ! If it's too warm , you sweat ! If something's funny , YOU LAUGH . If something's insanely erotic , YOU MAKE SURE NOBODY'S LOOKING AND THEN , I DUNNO , LOCK THE DOOR OR WHATEVER .
I regret the first time I met someone with a thick accent : she was older than I , and we had a little trouble communicating initially , because of the accent . But as I repeated myself to her I found myself unintentionally speaking both slowly AND loudly . I only did it for a little while , and as soon as I realized it I stopped , but I still felt ashamed . I was talking to her like she was dumb , just because of the accent ! I was the stereotypical ignorant racist .
Perhaps ! But what if I said . . . THE ALIENS GOT HOT TOO ? ?
You see life as . . . an infection ?
Thanks for the sweet tips , T - Rex !
And the reason is marketing ?
Guys , guys ! Check out my awesome trick !
In history , there was a place in England called " Frigedun , " which means " Valley of Frigg " !
MAYBE he appreciated a nice behind , but that doesn't -
But I can't hear him ! It'd be a pointless discussion .
You guys ! Let's ALL move to a - -
Okay so there's a single panel with three stand - up comics on stage , each in front of a microphone , talking and smiling , making gestures , that sort of thing . And in the foreground there's a guy in the audience who's whispering something to his friend , and the caption says " What's so funny 'bout Peace , Love , and Understanding ? " Tada !
No , wait , scratch that .
THE ANSWER IS NO
Maybe get away from the " for sale " angle ?
OH MY GOODNESS
Alright , I'm a plumber come to " fix your pipes " but you have no money ! Also you're Asian .
Next winter though !
What about people who came from eggs ? Like , for example , EVERY DINOSAUR EVER .
You might've had your last BRILLIANT idea , but you've still got your Just Okay ideas ! You'll be able to milk those for a while . Ad when you're done , there'll always be your Bad Ideas , your Terrible Ideas , your Ideas That A Baby Could Come Up With And That Same Baby Would Be Driven To Dismiss Them As Stupid .
Let us divide it among us so we each get a fair amount , yes ? I will divide exactly into thirds !
* Screw you guys *
Okay honestly it can apply to chocolate bars , but it becomes confusing if the bar isn't crammed with nuts , or somehow liquidly nutty . There is a SEMANTIC COLLISION .
AND THEY NEVER LOOKED NORMAL AGAIN
On the other hand , you never talked to that woman at the bus stop 15 years ago .
These events only serve to further undermine my credibility !
This being the Case , there was great room to Fear , for many chylds would not survive the certain Mis - chief done them by the Tyranno - saurus Rex , Utahed - Raptor , & c .
Did you tell the woman you had sex with that the REAL reason for it was so that you could be entertained at the dentist's ?
It is an advanced literary technique used by only our most handsome authors !
Hi T - Rex !
I think , as a people , we have kind of dropped the ball !
Ouch for modern marriages !
. . . and so the REASON I 'look a little down' is that suddenly everybody's talking about me and acting so concerned for my feelings ! It's unnerving and it makes me mad !
Stories GUARANTEED To Make You Say , " Ahhhh , So Scary " ! - by me , T - Rex !
CALL ALL THE BACHELORS WE KNOW
No no , it needs to be epic ! It needs to stand up against stories from EVERY RELIGION EVER .
You know it ! Perhaps if I stomp their beautiful ( yet deadly ) leader , 'Black Lotus' , I can end it for good !
Instead of " But , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east , and Juliet is the sun , " try " . @ juliet is hottttt ! ! seriously guys wtf " .
WHERE ONLY ONE CAN SURVIVE
WOOO !
I want to DATE him .
Beavers would be important , somehow .
Utahraptor ! I have nothing BUT strengths !
Why not just enjoy the time you've got ?
VISION OF TOMORROW !
Then , you add about 3 cups of spinach , and 1 / 2 cup of water , and maybe a few chopped - up chili peppers if you like your vegetables like you like your women ( spicy ) .
METHOD 5 : RANDOM SELECTION FROM THE PHONE BOOK !
she's alright
Hey , anytime !
What possible scary use could flour have ?
So what , the future of democracy is everyone arguing everything forever ? ?
But then when I thought about it and even my small successes mean I've somehow engaged in TRANSSPECIES COMMUNICATION with an animal , building a new language as we go , and the whole thing seemed so amazing and sciency that I had to sit down . I can talk to dogs !
whoa wrong window ! Okay how do you delete
Yep , even then .
Holy crap . There IS a way to ask for threesomes and not risk anything ?
That way we ALL get to live forever without breaking any universal laws ! Watch !
ATTENTION READERS : this book is a direct sequel to whatever book you read last . This book is made entirely out of chapters cut from the end of that OTHER book . Got it ?
You can go in to a doctor and he takes a blood test , and then his machine spits out a piece of paper that says " exploded " or " drowned " or " poisoned apple " and that's it . No dates , no details ! And so people who are to die from drowning spend their lives avoiding swimming pools , but they end up drowning anyway . Part of the fun would be seeing how !
WHEN SORTED BY REVERSE POPULARITY
Ah , who cares ! The Utahraptor's been having a bad time here , and I'm to credit ! I wonder how long he'll stay ?
Yes ! We will mine the future . . . for SCIENCE . And who cares if the future is in a constant state of flux ? We don't live there ! NOBODY WE KNOW LIVES THERE .
That's not really surprising , I guess , since every language EVER has been spoken by people who once were alive and are now totes dead . Similarly , every language has concepts of " male " and " female " , which suggests that we , as a people , find naughty bits interesting !
WHAT THE HELL , now his Facebook shows him looking for jobs in ANOTHER COUNTRY ? ! This , my friends - THIS -
I built a statue of myself !
I guess ! And I guess you could make an argument for " sexy is distracting , ON THE MOON . " But sexy is distracting everywhere ! You know ?
It was found in a concretion , and I'm sorry to tell you that those can develop in only a few years ! There are marshes in England with WWII - era bombs encased in concretions as well . It's cool , but it's not proof of time travellers !
Impossible ! A mid - life crisis is a crisis of confidence , and if there's one thing I've got , it's confidence !
Aw , sure they do , Dromiceiomimus ! Here , let me give you a pat on the head . You've earned it !
Yes . Yes , I BELIEVE I SHALL .
Hey ! Hey Utahraptor ! Do - do you think that some guys go to liquor stores to pick up chicks because they know everyone there is over 18 ?
Say you challenge me to a debate and I decide to let my fists do the debating ! Or say you go rogue and the government sends me in as their last , best hope !
The waiter said " enjoy your meal " and I said " you too ! "
Oh wow , the ghost of my noisy CPU fan that died fifteen years ago !
Let's'o'pizza and talk this over , Dromiceiomimus ! !
The one we have now is BROKEN . Sex as hunger ? Okay , it works with " sexual appetite " and it works in that you want sex , and then you have sex , and then you're like , man , that's all the sex * I * can handle , and then in a little while you start to get the munchies for sex again . But that's it !
Dromiceiomimus , did you know that the Utahraptor is a smoker ?
Screw you , I'm going home .
I get the sentiment , but I think it's a better idea on paper than realized . In real life , even if we survive , we'll end up weighing the cost of a plane ticket against a decade - old pact made for no real reason !
Well - um . . .
Hello ? ?
Boop - boop - a - doop .
Ah . So the Clay Mathematics Institute has a $ 1 , 000 , 000 prize for the first correct solution to the question " Does God like poutine ? "
T - Rex ! ! Did you draw yourself in my kitchen giving a thumbs up ?
He's a hairy protohuman who lives in the woods and is bad at being well - composed , visually competent photos .
All these listings say " no pets " , but you have a pet !
And maybe the reason tourists aren't running around here and now is because they have , um , ALL OF TIME to choose from ? If I could travel through time I wouldn't go back to yesterday , I'd go to the future ! I already know what happened yesterday : I ate a bunch and then I pooped a bunch !
A western ! A loner cowboy , caught between wilderness and civilization , enters the nation and tries to stop the disasters !
TURN VIRAL LEVEL TO 11 !
You've heard of him , right ? His regeneration process gets us a new Pope , and we're all , " ooh , what's THIS Pope like ? Maybe he'll be a ginger this time ! "
Man , you'll never find me on a mountaineering expedition or on a voyage to find the Northwest Passage . No thanks !
FEW CAN SURVIVE THEIR ELECTRICAL ONSLAUGHT
Was this before or after the dinosaur sex ?
So no choice at all then , unless you want to awkwardly modify your reading habits .
If I'm committed to this , I'm going to be on hold for the next 12 to 15 hours . I'm kinda tempted to do this , Dromiceiomimus ! I'll say , " Do you have any idea how long I've been on hold ? ? " and they'll say " No " and I'll say " Well , anyway it was a long time " .
No problem ! It's a tarantula intently staring at you , all 88 _ 88
But imagine that was fun , but with IMAGES woven into its DNA . Imagine work by an author who knows a picture is worth a thousand words , but who doesn't then turn around and WRITE THOSE THOUSAND WORDS INSTEAD . Imagine books finally reaching their final , peak form . Imagine COMICS .
We don't have all of Shakespeare's plays . Turns out , we TOTALLY LOST some of the work of the greatest playwright in the English language ever !
You're RIGHT ! Maybe it was a doughnut tree . Or POUTINE tree !
Given that you left in the middle of our conversation to go do that : uh , POSSIBLY ? ?
Antarctica is a clearly awesome place , but the bad news is many nations have laid claim to parts of it ? sometimes even overlapping with the claims of other nations ! Ruh roh !
Never ! !
Wow ! Your coolometer level just dropped from " pretty okay " to " striped mesh t - shirt that reads 'Mama's Suckiest Boy' " !
You waltz into a doctor's office and take a blood test , and the machine spits out a piece of paper that says " cheeseburger overdose " and that's 100 % how you're going to die .
Sure , but where's the easy option ? Where's the opt - out ? ?
Aww , look at the big baby ! Baby wants his bottle !
Stephen Hawking says a lot of things !
You've actually kissed like that ?
I went to a party last night , even though I was really tired and would've preferre to stay in and observe lights and sounds arranged into entertaining shapes according to instructions recovered from a transmitted data stream ! You know why ?
Good .
Leo and Virgo are zodiac signs for August !
You know , scissors that only work on soft , living flesh or whatever .
THIS time . . .
BABIES : " WHAT'S THE DEAL ? "
The subtitle is " Look At It , I Think It's The Kind From Star Trek " !
If that stupid Utahraptor hadn't told me his theory , I could easily stomp a tiny cabin like this wihout a care in the world .
Well , if it isn't Religion ! Out crushing the life of some poor woman under its trusty patriarchal foot , I see !
THAT NIGHT . . .
I'm sorry T - Rex , but something came up . But say " hi " to everyone for me !
LEFT A THERMOS FULL OF FOOD FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS , HOPING SOMEONE ELSE WOULD CLEAN IT OUT :
HE'S A TOTAL JERK BUT YOU GET MAD AT US IF WE SAY THAT
And I am relieved to hear it !
Polygamy !
Does she take anything back in time with her ?
I've written terrifying horror stories , but I've never written a terrifying ROMANCE story ! UNTIL NOW . * ahem *
WHOAH !
Oh REALLY ?
What if I told you the Ninja Turtles show up later and Raph turns werewolf too , in order to better battle a vampiric Krang ? ?
You have kicked their ass at chess so HARD that they DIED .
Huh ! You know what ?
Do you want me to tell you every time you've been sick over the past year ? Because I'll do it !
If you know what dogs are thinking than please let me know . My email address is whataredogsthinking @ dogswhataretheythinking . dogs .
You know what ? I don't think you would ! I think you ACTUALLY chose proprioception because it's not one of the classical five senses , and you wanted to be Mr . " Look At Me Guys I Chose An Unexpected Answer " .
I never borrowed that from you .
You try to turn on the light but it doesn't work because , hey , no electricity . So you think you'll go into work in your electric car but -
Dayyyy o !
I am so serious about this . I would have a fireman's pole . The waterslide - the waterslide I can see dying on the drawing board . But a big brassy fireman's pole is a very Freudian way to say " Ladies , I'm the dude with the giant fireman's pole in his house " .
Hah ! What'd he do ?
My girlfriend and I are in love , and my friend and I are happy . This equals 15 happiness points , 10 for love and 5 for friendship .
Well , I suppose we could just leave it at that in this story path .
Man , you just wait ! Kids will be boarding the train to SCARYTOWNE at my house .
DINOSAUR COMICS WISHES YOU A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS 2010
Alright , what do we got on tap . . . ah yes , here's a great inspirational quote ! " You miss 100 % of the shots you don't take ! "

Tip 1 : Grooming is important !
Aha !
Sure I can !
So the Utahraptor's playing Science to my Religion , eh ?
It's tricky to sound natural , though .
YAY , WE'RE STILL FRIENDS
Your problem is a ( n ) . . .
Well , this has been a disappointing morning
Utahraptor had made an excellent point .
Is everything ready Dromiceiomimus ?
" I CAN'T HELP MYSELF "
You must not have heard what my main character's name is !
Aw , I like how you were gonna put me on the cover !
" . . . maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem ! "
And we never will ! What's to be gained from arguing fine semantic points of justifying MURDER ?
I should have mentioned that sooner ; otherwise , my statement makes less sense .
What ? ! It was awesome !
Really ? You think the word 'tenet' is -
Oh , that is a part of it , to be sure .
I have been thinking of registering a domain name . . .
You don't know it's explicit ! Maybe it's alternate history ROMANCE , and I'm a dark and brooding doctor and she's Nurse Flapper of the S . S . Bedroom Surrender , where the seas AND the bosoms heave alike ? ?
. . . Ask that they seat themselves and expect them to act like adults ?
Was the food good ?
Well , I can see the use of " actress " , because the gender of the person affects what roles they can play .
i'm so far from even knowing what a bus IS
Seriously , helping others is alright
Anyway ! I think all we can conclude is that folks talk about the things around them , and horses were around us for a really long time . and THAT suggests that millions of years from now , there'll be lots of aphorisms about transporters , spacebots , and cyberdroids !
I play " Science " !
Basically everyone ?
When " Rudolph " went against " Frosty " this afternoon , he failed . But we were able to use the Sled . And now , he was successful .
I have lived as few men dared dream !
Um - geez , I can't do it on demand
And he's a VEGAN !
Looks like I don't !
I have written a new story , called " Make Way , Here Comes Tiny Chef ! "
The people on this planet have never conceived of things that haven't happened !
I think you'd be surprised how often there's no security measures against evil twins in real life . Why , you could ask your friend Utahraptor . . . IF HE WAS HERE ! !
THIS IS UNEXPECTEDLY HARD ? ?
Plus , you're doing all the stuff you want . If you don't have a sweetie , it doesn't matter : life is awesome ! You're awesome ! !
You take that back ! !
There's also the chance your symptoms represent a new and terrible disease unknown to medical science !
Sometimes we do , Dromiceiomimus . BETWEEN ROCK SONGS , THAT IS ! !
DINONYSIAN imotyatio !
I've really tried to separate sex from it . I don't know . I'd just like to try it again : hanging out , doing things together , having fun , only now with a non - zero chance of smooches !
George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were the two British dudes who first tried to climb Mount Everest !
You're reading it as if there's one " true " person that " true love " can refer to , meaning that you've got ONE CHANCE for total happiness in the world , and loving anyone else is just settling for second place or worse ! I've always seen it as referring to , say , how a wheel can be true , when it spins perfectly and doesn't wobble .
. . Seriously ?
Sure they are !
I know you know how to not talk like that ! !
DOGS
Ne sega !
Aw boo !
You said one thing would go wrong in 199 different ways !
T - REX DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK UP " WRONG " ON WIKIPEDIA THERE IS AN IMAGE OF YOU
Sure ! !
I will never be poor again
They need a lot of water .

FRIGGIN' TIPS
What is it , Utahraptor ?
I - I don't know !
BUT T - REX ! PDAS CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A RELATIONSHIP ! PROOF TO THE WORLD THAT YOU LOVE ANOTHER PERSON !
Love !
But then the downside is that if I saw a car accident , I'd be duty bound to try to prevent it . And PLUS , once word got out about my awesome power , whenever I was with my friends and they tripped or whatever , they'd blame me ! They'd sit on the ground rubbing their knee saying " THANKS T - REX " with ultimate sarcasm when THEY were the clumsy chumps !
Here , I'll demonstrate again , this time on a tiny human lady !
The second announcement is that everyone within the sound of my voice is awesome !
No , what ? I just figured if I said " sunny with cloudy periods " that would describe the weather SOMEWHERE on the planet .
Me too ! But not with Nintendo !
Man , you want to sit at home and fart until the air's blue , I'm not gonna stop you . But when you go out in public and fart all over the place , isn't that rude ? Isn't that rude no matter how addicted you are to farting ? ?
Oh , would you ?
Well , frig , this has been a complete waste of a Monday morning !
APPARENTLY .
Are you sure you want to know ?
Whatever ! If I were in the future and I could open up a book and see " The awesome terminal velocity skateboard didn't work , OH WELL " , then I would do that .
You know what these people say ?
But then how do solar sails work ? And photon engines ? Don't they work by photons pushing against things ? HAS SCIENCE FICTION BEEN LYING THROUGH ITS SCIENCE TEETH ?
Seeing all my old friends and family over the holidays has been fun . Good times !
What o'clock is it ? Oh my goodness , would you look at that .
Okay . We do .
What ? They're awesome .
T - REX IF YOU DESTROY THE UNIVERSE I'M GOING TO BE SUPER CHEEZED
You eat dinner and have been rewarded with a fortune cookie . You open it up and it says " HI ! GOD HERE . YOU SHOULD BE A DOCTOR . "
See , if I am just the psychological product of my environment , then each action I take I could not have taken in any other way . I HAD NO CHOICE !
Really ! So I'm talking to the new improved T - Rex ?
Hah ! " Hey baby , thanks for the sex ! / It was hot / ( in most respects . ) "
. . . something . . .
Okay , it's by T - Rex , " author of award - eligible wordsmithery " .
I would have words with past T - Rex ! That dude has a lot of STALE FRIGGIN' OPINIONS .
Utahraptor and I enter a bar , him dressed mostly in black , and me dressed mostly in white . We sit at opposite ends of the bar .
You're seriously comparing emotions to pooping your pants ?
( left elbow down , right elbow up ) The crazy Utahraptor thinks I have OCD .
Yeah , when people talk to me about intelligent design , I yell " BED BUGS HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED STAB RAPES " .
T - REX YOU'RE SHOUTING
WE'LL BE LIKE
So terrible ! The very idea makes me want to barf .
So , hey , it turns out you can nominate yourself for a Pulitzer prize .
Then come with me tonight : we'll go to a show !
No I have not PLEASE don't tell me what it's like , PLEASE .
See ? Like right there ! Dromiceiomimus and I were talking about staging an intervention .
Under the couch !
Oh wow ! Turns out some of your Facebook friends DO find minor annoyances annoying !
IS IT STILL FORESHADOWING IF THIS NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENS
That IS how time travellers tend to roll !
- RUBBER .
I practiced until I got it RIGHT .
There are some phrases , usually joined by " and " or " or " , that we always say the same way even though it would make logical sense to say them another way . For example : " I am sick and tired of these phrases ! "
It will be about a young man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect - like creature !
EARLY hip hop was more concerned with how fun it was to be rapping to the beat , and with assuring us that what we were hearing was not a test . I miss those days !
It Was On The Local News .
This has raised some pretty profound questions for me . First off , it seems evident that I have finite space in my brain , and things are getting erased .
But it's totally not !
It also happens when folks spend a lot of time wishing they could be Shakespeare's Pal !
Hey , are you still going on about that sleep ?
FINE .
I have a possibly inappropriate question
TODAY'S LECTURE : DISCRETE MATH
YOU REFER TO " THERE ARE LIKE A BILLION DIFFERENT RELIGIONS , SO , YOU KNOW , KEEP THAT IN MIND I GUESS "
FINE . You know what ? FINE . I'm done dreaming !
Maybe I don't want to eat pet food ?
Hey , are you still in for tonight ?
So to quantify our zombie terror , all we need to do is calculate R0 !
I find it hard to believe you've come up with 365 ( to 366 ) different emotions !
It is the T - Rex of the animal world !
Creepy : I love you so hard !
But ohhhh noooo , wait that's impossible right now ! We've got cosmetic surgery to adjust the sizes of noses , mammalian breasts , even foreheads , but have we put any research into augmenting our offensive capabilities ? Nope !
All I'm saying is we ESTIMATE it all the time . Heck , you do it whenever you're paid hourly and you speed into work ! Divide the extra money you get by being there sooner by the increase chance of death the added speed brings you , and you've just VALUED YOUR OWN LIFE .
I will seduce her with a two - pronged attack of my stomping skills and wit !
Just watch !
What would ?
What If Everybody Else Was Faking Happiness Too ? It Would Be Impossible To Tell .
People from three weeks ago were IDIOTS .
Yeah ! It & # 8217 ; s like you can & # 8217 ; t imagine a universe where someone could be a dentist but not actually really be all that into teeth , or a cleaner who doesn & # 8217 ; t despise disorder . Jobs are all done because of joy and intense personal conviction !
Man , forget verbs !
Sure I can ! I just did !
Oh no , now that he's got his wallet out he's getting other things out of his pocket too ! He's got a gun ! ! He's shooting Mr . Pepsi ! !
Spider - Man choked back another bite of the cake . He chewed , looking around the room . " So nasty . " he breathed .
OUR STORY TAKES A SUDDEN DIVE . . . INTO GRAMMATICAL SCRUTINY !
Lovely stomp , wonderful stomp ! Little house , how would you like a moderate dose of stompage today ?
Yes , that is a fair and accurate impression of me and my awesome desription of marriage .
Did you know that dogs and dinosaurs co - existed ?
I have a question that I can ask all my friends ! The question is , " would you rather kiss a music student , or a psychology student ? " .
Hey , I forgot to tell you my big news the other day !
THIS IS WHAT WE SOUND LIKE TO OTHER ADULT BABIES ! !
Let's assume narratives can be reduced to yes / no decisions , and on average real people make a yes / no decision every 15 seconds . Two people are needed to cover each option for every decision ! So after - um , 33 decisions , we've got more people needed than are alive now , and we're only eight minutes into our story . It is a stories - in - real - life disaster !
Am I the only one connecting the dots here ? ?
T - REX : THE ULTIMATE FRIEND ?
Spending it would just shift the problem onto somebody else .
Thank you . Utahraptor , ladies and gentlemen !
T - REX HAS DEVELOPED A FEAR OF MISSING OUT
OKAY WHAT IF I CREATED HOVERCARS
Heck , I've got the time !
Maybe I'll flip some cars with my male genitals !
You want me to ghost - write it ?
NORMALLY , I would have !
What I've come to love is the tension between filmmaker and subject , the way editing can so easily be used to slip the filmmaker's politics into the film . The veneer of realism , the claim of legitimacy - ooh ! It's all so GOOD . There's politics in every film , sure , but only documentary makes the claim of truth , and it's THAT claim that makes it all so interesting .
Would you say that you're a . . . Cloonatic ?
NOW whenever I see him do it I get REALLY cheezed off about it , much more than , you know , footwear on a fuzzy floor should warrant . I've let it get so under my skin that I can't trust my reactions anymore ! Can - can YOU ask him not to ?
Great ! Listen , T - Rex , we've known each other for a long time , right ?
Doesn't that sound like FUN ? ?
Oh no ! are those criminals breaking into my house ? !
Uh . . . nightmare terror , I guess ?
That's just inaction with good PR ! That's not work .
Hooray for her coming back , not hooray for you stepping on a tiny woman to express excitement .
Precisely my point !
. . . BESIDES the version of me that was sent back in time and left snarky - ass notes carved into rocks , which , when assembled properly , read " FUTURE " " ME " " I'M " " TRAPPED " " IN " " THE " " PAST " " SO " " YOU " " CAN " " JUST " " SUCK " " AN " " EGG " ? ?
I have been thinking lately
Oh my god !
In Turkish , you have to say whether you saw an event or just heard about it later !
Today is a good day I think to find God !
Hey God , you know on Star Trek , when sometimes they go back in time ?
Hey ! I don't live at home ! I'm responsible for getting my own food and for making sure I don't die most of the time .
I would not , as I think you couldn't even define what a neoclassical pastiche is , my friend .
With a Z ?
LATER THE UTAHRAPTOR USES THE MIND - CONTROL RAY ON HIMSELF , AND BECOMES . . . A KINDER PERSON !
INTERESTING . Utahraptor , we can't be married because . . .
Holy craps !
You just defined fatalism . . . despite your best efforts not to !
we are privileged to be alive
Yeah , I guess I was ! Hah hah ! That WOULD be pretty crazy .
I mean it , that's really clever !
EARLY SUCCESSES IN PUBERTY :
FACT : Dogs are good at smelling but not so good at seeing . They can't even see the colour red !
Hence the " valley " - you accept the creature more and more , then are suddenly repulsed , then you accept it the most .
Turns out greater minds than yours have thought about time travel already , huh ?
You might sooner ask what if the sky runs out of air !
I suspect my mailman may have knowledge beyond his years if you know what I'm saying

INFORMED OPINIONS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY COMICS
I think it is time YET AGAIN to have a manliness competition !
Okay , but - the reason religions have creation myths is that they're addressing huge questions with no obvious answer . " Where did we all come from ? " Everyone's pondered that question ! " Where did that T - Rex guy come from ? " is really only pondered by the other guy in the bathroom stall .
Oh noooooooo why can't my favorite corporations just get along ? ?
Right . So that raises the question : IS EVERYONE FROM THAT PERIOD IN HELL , OR IS HEAVEN OVERWHELMINGLY POPULATED BY RACISTS ? !
It's amazing , Dromeceiomimus ! We have records of ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS this dude had , before we'd gotten around to inventing recorded sound . What did Beethoven think about panini sandwiches ? I know , you guys ! LET'S CHECK THE CONVERSATION BOOKS .
T - REX STAYS UP FOR 41 HOURS IN THIS COMIC :
MEANWHILE , IN ANOTHER REALITY :
Excuse me , stunt driver ? Are YOU afraid of death ?
Q : Can you eat in restaurants that have been serving food since before YOUR country was even a thing ? ?
You're saying that in a breakup , entities should not be multiplied without necessity ?
WHAT EXCUSE ME T - REX BUT IF YOU WANT TO MESS WITH GAMEPLAY WHY BOTHER REMAKING A CLASSIC GAME
AW . DAMN IT ! !
Our universe is almost certainly a simulation !
Oh my GOSH I would instantly marry them in space and I will tell you how many regrets I would about that in 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . .
It's Ma -
Ah , you refer to my classy search for a middle ground !
Yep ! It's nice to see you writing a nice wholesome children's book for a change .
Aw dang ! !
Okay , so Superman punches the robot but then one grabs him in its hand and tries to squeeze him to death . Superman uses his heat vision to melt the arm off , then swings it around like a baseball bat to knock that robot into the nearby ocean . This fries the robot's systems , which gives Superman an idea !
Oh my gosh that FINALLY explains all the screaming
[ thinking ] Genius !
Huh ? What sort of errand ?
Winning at wrestling a bear ! !
Oh crap , wow , I did NOT imagine big enough ! !
So Dromiceiomimus , imagine I'm sending you a letter that says " hi " . You get it , so now we both know that I said " hi " , but only you know that YOU know that I said " hi " . So you send a letter that says " got it " , which I get - but then I know that you know that I said " hi " , but you don't know that I know that YOU know that I said " hi " . And so on !
You mean you don't know ? ! You're God !
This planet is crazy . I leave out a bowl of spaghetti because I was gonna clean it later and just forgot , which happens all the time to the even most responsible of adults and they should not be made to feel bad about it , and three days later -
Well , at some point the man has to make a choice !
Alright ! The sooner everyone has clean drinking water , the sooner I can go back to enjoying my poops ! !
Excitement Comics
But & # 8211 ; that doesn't really make sense .
It's like vegetarianism : all you hear is from the militant extremes ( " Meat is Murder ! " " Vegetarians are Sissies " ) and it's hard to find a balanced viewpoint !
" In my opinion , I mean , and I'm probably totally wrong ! "
Aren't you afraid ?
For instance , should a can be out of arm's reach and you're like , man , I wish that can had a hole in it AND was knocked over , then a gun can be used here too !
Alright , fine .
Because if verification emails can get through , then it won't be long until spammers send messages that look enough like them to also get through . There's still a hole ! And if you seal it , you miss real verification emails .
FOP is one of the rarest conditions known to medicine !
WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SEXIST , ENGLISH

Some people would spend a lot of money on a heck of a lot a cool meals .
DUDE .
Um -
I'm asking because my copy of Gone With The Wind ends with " After all , tomorrow is another day . OR IS IT ? ? " . And my copy of The Great Gatsby says " So we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . OR DO WE ? AHHHH WHO KNOWS ? ? "
Well , uh - it's just that your arms are too tiny to possibly reach the keys . I'm uh ( this is awkward ) - I'm sorry , T - Rex , but this is one dream of yours that will be thwarted by your own body .
T - Rex , it's me , Utahraptor ! Utahraptor from the future ! !
Pasta's easy to cook AND you can make it delicious by putting better foods on top of it ! Try putting some cheese on your pasta . The cheese will melt , and now you get to eat melted cheese . Doesn't that remind you of Pizza ?
That wasn't in the movie .
Together , we made this adventure an extraordinary success ! ! !
Are we talking about Chad's thing ?

T - REX AND HIS DINOSAUR FRIENDS IN : " OLD PHOTOGRAPHS "
The root extract was eventually replaced with cheaper alternatives , stabilizers and preservatives were added , and that's how we ended up with the modern candy which still bears the name of the wetland plant it originated from thousands of years ago : the marshmallow .
For instance , some might say that the destruction of this log cabin violates fundamental principles . But if I were to show that it is a necessary means to a noble end , such arguments are revealed to be petty and ideological !
THAT is an opinion for another card , perhaps one labelled " So Um , I'm Assuming You Want To Keep This Friendship Platonic ? "
This , my friends , is the true meaning of friendship !

It's only because I had some illegal thoughts , and then , I wrote down the illegal thoughts
I am getting old ! WHICH IS FINE , except I'm starting to worry that all I do is young guy stuff and not mature adult stuff , like having a mortgage , or owning more than one pair of nice pants .
Man , how do we know ? !
Ooh , what if ? What if ? Here's a what if for you : WHAT IF I MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS ?
Excuse me sir , but our Hallowe'en joke workshop is a comedic safe space meant to feature only constructive criticism .
Well , I mean . . . that's just our society ?
" Guilty as charged ! " T - Rex laughed , opening the door !
Turns out , my brain is totally awesome !
ONLY THINGS IN YOUR PAST LIGHT CONE CAN AFFECT / KILL YOU
Wow ! Robots and all !
You think that if you shout " woo ! " enough , a party will form , don't you ?
That analogy kinda - fell apart at the end there .
That's kinda evil , isn't it ? I thought he was , you know , more Aspergers than adversary .
Yes , I bought it " on layaway " .
The end !
COME TO OUR SLUMBER PARTY , NEIGHBOUR ?
Attention , shoppers : boxing day is stripping down to its lingerie , and on our third floor , New Year's Eve wants you to have sex with it .
" We can sexy " is totally going to be my epitaph !
But , on the other hand , putting a " kiss me " sign on someone's back would be EXTREMELY CRAZY !
Ha ha , just kidding . I went to get some smokes .
MINE ARE BEING OMNIPOTENT AND CREATING UNIVERSES AND BEING OMNICOOL AND DESTROYING UNIVERSES AND
You are ! At this rate , the only memories you'll have to fondly look back on when you're older are those of walking around and saying how great it is to be young !
Hey buddy !
Whatever dudes ! I'm pretty sure I'm a genius over here .
Got it .
THEN I AM NOT TOO PROUD TO BEG . Please , excuse me for a moment .
8 PM :
Exactly ! I'm not stubbing THESE toes any more !
Almost as bad as when they hover juuust slightly above it .
Okay , um : There was a young man who would yell , That we all had a story to tell , Feelings in his bones Said to find a home From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell !
. . . That is an accurate representation of my whole deal , yes .
Where you be vegetarian for free ?
THE FLAVOUR I MEAN
Everyday , everyone in my story gets a little older ! Everyone dies , eventually !

But that's wrong ! Oh man , remind me never to debate you on the internet EVER .
Yeah ! It blows my mind that there's a phrase you have to say . There's TESTS to become Jewish , and you can be Buddhist just by saying so . But Islam is right in the middle ! No tests , just a magic phrase !

On top of will , " and testament " !
That works too !
Goodness , I haven't been on very many wacky adventures lately . It's time to change that ! It's time for -
Oh no ! It's affected her too !
This happened , dude . Project A119 . CARL SAGAN worked on it . It only got cancelled when they couldn't guarantee the nuke wouldn't miss and fall back to Earth , and they also got kinda worried somehow - SOMEHOW - nuking the moon would not be the PR coup they'd hoped .
" Non - negotiable " works in those situations too .
T - REx , these are regional dialects . Aren't both pronunciations of coupon listed in the dictionary ? Doesn't that make them equally valid ?
Then later on she died anyway , because death WILL inevitably claim us all ! !
Maggie , THIS IS INEXCUSABLE .
Actually , T - Rex , there's been a few stories written on that theme : Asimov and Clarke both wrote one !
What is this , amateur hour ?
All relationship problems ever : TOTALLY SOLVED ? ?
You're walking on dangerous land , T - Rex !
It's a possibility , I guess ! Hmmm . . .
I'm not much of a " songsmithery " but I guess I know my muse ! It's , um , cold showers .

It is common to imagine your life as a story , with yourself as a main character ! It's a story with no real climax that always ends with you totally dead .
The night started cold - Too cold , and it got colder : A night for murder .

You mean the " dinosaur factor " , of course !

Where are you , Utahraptor ? Are you hiding under this house ? Come out , come out , wherever you are !
FINE , but if this doesn't solve the feelings then I'm gonna be SUPER CHEEZED ! !
You're tasting your own saliva right now ! That's your body !
Like that : precisely .
In my head I mean , I never got around to proposing it
That one's not bad .

Lou Gramm , ladies and gentlemen !
Dromiceiomimus , do you need your lawn mowed ? Fingernails trimmed ? Trends forecasted ? ANIMALS INSEMINATED ? ?
No ! Because I have such bad breath ! How could I ever brush my teeth with these tiny arms ?
But there's tons of other stuff I've never bothered to memorize too ! What's my blood type ? Social insurance number ? Hat Size ? The thing is , Dromiceiomimus , responding " Yes please " on a questionnaire only works for SOME of these questions .
Oh snap ! !
Oh , " actress " and " stewardess " , I guess - words which some people will use without hesistation , but which others will call sexist . There's no consensus !
It's - it's so close to being literally , T - Rex .

The lender is renting out money , just the same as if they'd rented out a helicopter ! And just like the familiar helicopter rental , I've got to pay money to rent it - usually proportional to the value of the thing borrowed and for how long I've got it .

So let's hear these tips then !
COMICS IN WHICH A GOD SUDDENLY FEELS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
" I Had No Idea Songs Were This Powerful , It's So Wonderful That Music Can Literally Change The World ( Dubstep Remix ) "

HOW THE UNIVERSE ENDS . HOW THE UNIVERSE ENDS , a story starring YOU ! But it was written by me , T - Rex
WILL AND GRACE IS CUTE AND I LIKE HOW SOME OF THE CHARACTERS ARE GAY AND IT'S LIKE THEIR WHOLE LIFE
But think of the potential ! You , the hip twentysomething man - about - town , me , the bumbling but goodhearted roommate . . think of the possibilities for humor and hijinks !
Alright , alright . Fine .
The " morning song " like from cartoons , yeah !
Terrorists have sympathizers ! !
Aplogies in advance , but I'm going to punch you now . The force MAY push you backwards for kilometers .
I am the last son of the doomed planet of Krypton !
You know how sometimes you save at a bad point and it's half a second before you're going to die , and you keep restoring , but there's nothing you can do ?
Okay : 2 . 5 billion kilometers is enough to make a one - way trip to Saturn and get most of the way back before dying , OR to travel part of the way to Uranus , but again , dying well before you arrive .
Isn't that just a bit too convenient ?
Hark ! The circle of incredibly sketchy driving instructors is complete !
I'd now like to address my body directly from a moment . Thanks for teaming up with science and being SO AWESOME , my body . Seriously : thanks bro .
The circuit satisfiability problem is determining if there are some inputs that make the outputs of a circuit " true " !
What I miss is scenes in movies where people would be yelling at each other , and then they'd both stop , stare at each other for a beat , and then they'd be making out ! WHY DOES THAT NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE ? It was awesome !
I guess if there was some religious beliefs that one person had and the other didn't , it could lead to tension , but relationships are about compromise , right ? But if someone , say , adopts the actions of a religion as a compromise , but not the beliefs behind it , isn't that just going through the motions , which isn't really what most religions are about ?
We're going to try electro - shock therapy .
BUT THAT IS A LIE TOO !
Top of my bucket list is to die without ever using the phrase " bucket list " , so thanks for ruining that for me . But next would be to get thrown out of a place !

Neat , huh ?
today's technique : FORESHADOWING
We've evolved to find food FRIGGIN' TASTY , but YOU TOO can balance that out by remembering how gross eating is ! Remember : eating is when you dig something out of the DIRTY , DIRTY GROUND and cram it inside your FACE . And if it doesn't fit ? NO PROBLEM , just use parts of your SKULL that are EXTRUDING OUT THROUGH YOUR GUMS to break it down into smaller pieces .
You've also got bowler hats , which are like round top hats , a little ? And then you've got pith helmets , which are , um , retro explorer hats I think .

NEITHER OF THOSE FACTS ARE WOOWORTHY . I want FUN August facts , not -
It's not just " we flaot off into the sky " . The earth's core becomes a bomb , everything blasts away from the sun , and the universe eventuallyends up being a fine mist of particles each trying to get as far away as possible from all the other particles . Good one , T - Rex .

Look , I like games that are fun !
Cha - ching ! It's great , because everyone loves Shakespeare AND ALSO finding out what characters were up to before they got interesting . It'll be Hamlet , only he's happy and well - adjusted , walking around saying " I certainly hope my father doesn't get murdered ! InDEED ! " and then Ophelia says " That's right , baby ! I , incidentally , plan to remain sane . " and then there's IRONY . Shakespeare fans love irony !
HOW TO BE MANLY
Sounds like a fine line to me , my friend !
Or love ! The prenup is a way of announcing AND VERIFYING that you love them for Who They Are , not for what they've got in their pants ! In their wallet in their pants . It was a great metaphor , Dromiceiomimus .
- " With Real Poops " .
AUTHOR OF HOMESTUCK AND BELOVED CREATOR OF NAMCO HIGH
Hey , the 90s called and left a callback number and I called it and now I've got the 90s on the line .
Dromiceiomimus , YOU'RE a good friend !
Hah , hah , too late ! Looks like being T - Rexian is using unpopular and out of favour slang for no reason !
We don't have a duress phrase !
ACTUALLY NO I DIDN'T BUT I SAID I DID BECAUSE OF APRIL FOOLS' DAY
And so in Conclusion , that's where babies come from !
Frig man , who's counting ? Several times a day , easy . There's days I've done it before I even get out of bed !
Wait , someone pop quizzed you on their name ?
Utahraptor ! All I've come up with is the name of the dude for when he becomes a classy lady : Professorita Henrietta Higginsfem !
That's - that's a really good point , Utahraptor . Alright . No more joke names .
It sounds boring .
I miss them ! Sure , we were probably a little petty and - - well , kids , but it feels like those friendships were somehow simpler . . . more pure !
I hope I don't run into the Dromiceiomimus today ! She probably thinks I'm crazy since I asked for a " thigh five " the last time we met .
SEVERAL HOURS LATER :
Cibo Matto - Birthday Cake
That's what the book says , anyway . It's not anti - monogamy , but it is pro - polygamy .
" Gay " .
Yep ! And that's how a woman who died over a thousand years ago without ever even boning anyone is memorialized every day by an insulting adjective .
ATTENTION , MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ! !
I didn't invent it ! I am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently .
Shakespeare was a famous writer guy , but we know basically nothing about him ! There's only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day .
Programming's a skill !
Dromiceiomimus , let's put modesty aside for a second and just " rap " , person to person . I think when we do that , we can agree : there's nothing I've done that I haven't excelled at .
I could probably turn all - you - can - eat ribs into a freakin' aria !
That's actually a METAPHORICAL goose , referring to a horse . I'm not even joking . The more you look at English , the more you realize :
Or at least , I think it was crazy . I don't remember much of the dream : all I remember is waking up and thinking , " Wow , what a crazy dream ! "
I guess PERSONALLY I prefer dogs . So hey ! I don't mean to be rude , but as God , um -
I just realized I'm even better than I thought ! I'm not just throwing my voice through space - I'm also throwing it through TIME ! I can send messages to the past by simply throwing my voice there !
Kid Bruce Wayne lit only by streetlight as he's on his knees surrounded by his dead parents emoji .
To that end , I will write a novel !
" I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT "
Maybe he's just a sartorialist polyglot ?
I would seriously marry robots if it were even possible .
Oh yeah ! I was gonna say he's hard to train !
DID SOMEONE AT WORK STEAL YOUR LUNCH ?
Anyway !
Because it's helluva stupid !
Maybe it's symbolic for love ? Great in moderation , but you can ruin it by taking too much ( i . e . , smothering the person with affection ) ?
So I hear you're having a minuswomb operation ?
Of course , this idea is largely alien to ME , as I'm never at a loss for a witty riposte !
You guys , what if reincarnation is real ? !
But dudes and ladies have finite lifetimes . The past isn't going anywhere ! We can dig it up whenevs .
August is named after Augustus , who despite being a Roman emperor , still died alone . . . as must we all !
I have only personal items . I have nothing to declare .
Man ! I know it .
Damn you , database ! You're a loose cannon ! Your CPU usage grows every day and your disk I / O is off the chart !
Perhaps . . .
Perhaps not yet !
He's so great
Not much has changed , T - Rex ! Because as you know , we are dinosaurs , and dinosaurs DO NOT USE TECHNOLOGY ! !
I like my women like I like my dogs : well - trained and obedient ? I like my women like I like my dogs : created by blending Scottish and Mexican genetic information ? ?
The word " cybernetic " isn't JUST about abominable marriages of flesh and machine with glowing red eyes that hate all organic life , or as THEY call them , " organos " .
IT'S ME , I'M GREAT , LET ALL POSSIBLE HISTORIES RECORD THAT I THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME
NEW " EUPHEMISMS " FOR EMOTIONS COMICS
It breaks down to " Have you ever punched children , and , if so , are you still doing so ? " But since these are merged , and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer , " no " becomes misleading . The solution is not to answer " yes " or " no " , but to reject the question !
Because if you find an animal that's genetically 99 . 4 % the same as you , you can totally go to town ON THEIR FOOD ! For example , if you're a human , try eating some Monkey Crunch ! It's cheap ! And crunch ! !
I guess love and the artifacts of affection are so played up in our society that by being noncommittal to its ( arguably ) greatest expression , marriage , I avoid tacitly endorsing the commercialization of an emotion and the industry surrounding it !
I know it
I like it , but can you give the show a " forbidden oxygen " element ?
Hah ! MEMORIES .
I really don't think dreams are important ?
But you're not realizing what I've unlocked here ! I'm the first ever to realize that if one ghost is scary , then nested ghosts increase fright LINEARLY while maintaining a fixed surface area ! It is the most terror possible per cubic foot !
WAYS TO WIN OR AT LEAST END ARGUMENTS IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE RESPECTING YOU
And I actually don't think the bite option is that fun anyway . Biting someone and getting their blood into your mouth ? Honestly ? I can think of like four better ways to spend a Friday night .
I will have a telephone that lets me talk to Corey Feldman !
I should probably do that .
What almost happened ?
Alright .
But then people start wondering why Bruce Wayne seems to spend 24 hours a day in bed !
I call it , " The Inundation " .
Aw crap ! Now I'm judging all actual books against the amazing but fictional Puppy War and Pup - Pup Peace ! !
AW YEAH , BABY . Women want me ! Men want to BE me !
I'm so manly that I pound nails into the wall with my bare hands !
WHERE THEY PLACED HIS BODY INTO BOILING WATER AND ATE HIM ! !
. . . What's left ?
I'M NOT MADE OF PAGEDOWNS , WIKIPEDIA
Honestly , this is pretty much all I know about the difference between ethics and morals , and I'm not even sure that's right .
( Where " we " refers to the general population , of course ! )
Okay , so perhaps there ARE those who find old jokes in old books to be hilarious , and we just happen to have different senses of humour ! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE TO GENERALIZE ACROSS EVERY LIVING THING THAT CAN LAUGH , AND ALSO READ .
HAHA ME TOO MAN WHAT ARE YOURS
Cut out that kind of talk !
Yes , " Surge " ! It says " dynamic " . It says " power " . And now YOU can say things like " Gentlemen : I've got the urge . . . to SURGE ! ! "
Pranks are supposed to end in laughter all around ?
That sounds . . . like okay times ? I think ?
It wasn't meant to be !
Amazing , eh , Dromiceiomimus ?
I guess we can only hope that the insect kingdom never becomes zombified ?
JOKES EXPLAINED :
That seems to have many of the same limitations as Method # 1 !
SORRY DUDES ! !
When I was a child I used to imagine I had just teleported into my own body from an earlier time . Or I'd pretend that I'd suddenly lost several years of my memories .
It is just SO CLASSY when someone says " passers by " and eschews the much more pedestrian and terrible " passer bys " . Shouts out to that !
Practicing does not make you get bigger , only getting older does that .
Neat ! But largely irrelevant to us , as our reproduction is not done through vaginal intercourse !
And now he'll only give up your beer if you go to his house instead !
It's accurate that British dudes recall summers , then say goodbye ?
I'm fine , T - Rex !
I've never seen a " thanks for the sex " card . What do they say ? " Hey sweet stuff / That sex was fine / An offer of less sex / I would decline " ?
I am enamoured with writing things in cheque memo fields . It is a rare chance for comedy in the otherwise staid world of financial services and automated cheque processing !
And they were SO GOOD , they supplemented or replaced existing cultural dishes !
I think you're ignoring the symbolism AND sociology behind tagging , T - Rex !
Hello !
A collection of SCIENCE FICTION fairy tales , that is ! !
And less depressing !
I am going to tell you a story , and it stars an old man whose name I don't know . He went into a diner , ordered some fries with gravy from the only person working there , paid for them , and sat down ! Soon she brought the fries and gravy to his table !
But the bank was evil so it was okay to steal from it . It was justified . It's like if you stole from Hitler . Would that be so bad ? Hitler would be mad if you stole from him . But , he's Hitler . There are a lot of moral grey areas in mystery stories .
I like to judge a person based on who they are , not on whatever rumours I hear about them !
Hah ! Too bad we're not in Conclusion , Dromiceiomimus . APPLES RULE
Buddhism !
THEN YOU COULD WATCH AS A METEORITE PUNCHES THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE
now featuring : tips i found in this one book !
Then I win and it's boring , the end !
You already have a personality , T - Rex .
But they need some money upfront , right ?
OPINIONS WHICH I REMIND YOU ARE OBJECTIVELY CORRECT
People crowded to one side to see it , and that was it . The boat rolled and sank in 20 feet of water , 20 feet from the wharf . The new lifeboats had made her impossibly top - heavy , unstable , AND unseaworthy !
SEE
See , why didn't I ever say that to YOU ?
Yes ! And celebrity gossip sites can have . OMG and . SMH !
T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR ARE DINOSAUR'S SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY'RE NOT USING IT .
Oh , sure , " probably " ! But I have CERTAINLY done it , because I sat down and did it . It only took an hour , and now I don't have to live with doubt or uncertainty . I don't have to live with probablys !
STEAL ME SOMETHING GOOD PLEASE
It's hilarious ! It's IRONIC , because I've never actually called a woman a " kitten " , on account of how I'm not a facial hair dude from the seventies ? And it also says " I understand you're upset , but not REALLY upset , because I'm willing to make a joke that's sort of at your expense , but also really at my expense too , because now I look like a sexist facial hair dude ! Let's share a laugh ! "
The merchant of MENACE ? !
And - you know what a " whore " is ?
You sure know a lot about the history of hysteria , T - Rex !
Eat my weight in chocolate ?
Utahraptor is afraid of ghosts !
DON'T use bland generic descriptors , like saying you're " friendly " , " down to earth " , " quirky " , have a good sense of humor " , " enjoy movies " , " like reading " , or " love to laugh " . All of these are euphemisms for anal sex , by the way .
Also , these martinis are more like marTINIES !
I believe Lucasian hyperspace is more " routes that are travelled " than " technology that can be adapted in new ways " .
AS AN EXAMPLE BACKSLASH LETTER O FORWARDSLASH
Another year without me being awarded a Nobel Peace Prize ! I hate to me " Mr . Where's My Peace Prize Already " , but , well - here we are . I GUESS that's who I am now . I GUESS I should get some new business cards printed up .
Yeah , you are , you're just running through your life in the wrong order . Go from worst to best and you're there .
I kind of hoped I might go a bit further than this in life , but then again , maybe not . It's entirely possible that this , right here , is as far as I go . In 10 years I could be that guy who is WAY too nostalgic for the past . " Remember how great it was before I screwed up my life , guys ? " That'll be me .
" It seems unhappiness is to be my most reliable chaperone , " she said , sighing again .
Hah hah , really ? You're not the T - Rex who demands thigh fives from his friends ?
I've got one for you !
" Awesatisfactory " . . . doesn't sound so head - meltingly awesome ?
Hmm . . .
I hope you have all saved up your $ 59 . 95 because my new video game is going to be amazing ! And it will cost $ 59 . 95 . Now you have all the facts you'll need to enjoy . . .
I hope that by " assume " you mean " make it so " SO MUCH that I'm going to pretend that's what you said ! Immortality , here I come !
Neither is intrinsically good ! This therefore is a definition rather than a value judgement .
And I don't see how that's possible !
MEANWHILE IN UNIVERSE x95 :
. . . FRIG .
T - Rex , he told me because he'd lent you the money a long time ago , and he was concerned that asking you for it a third time in as many months was not polite . I told him YOU were the one who was impolite in for putting him in this situation !
Babies ! Everyone is always having them all the time . This is not an exaggeration .
It works in BOTH temporal directions
" Smiles " !
WITH YOUR TERRIBLE FRENCH ACCENT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING " MY PIZZA RESISTANCE "
Clearly !
There is nuance , subtlety in the placement of the Friggin' . Contrast and compare The Friggin' Sound of Music ; Guess Who's Coming to Friggin' Dinner ; Big Friggin' Trouble in Little Friggin' China ; and Yes , Virginia , There Is A Friggin' Santa Claus .
So it goes !
You didn't really eat them , did you ? !
T - REX YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE FRIEND
HEY T - REX . I MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ANT MAN TO SHRINK HIS ATOMS AND TALK TO ANTS WITH ENGLISH . JUST NOW . IT WAS TO SPITE YOU .
I CONFESS I FIND THE SCENT
But he's not even biting the toenails of others . I'm confused on the economics of this . Is it - performance art ?
God , is it ONLY reporters who get to say " This just in " ?
Oh really ? !
Remember
I know , I know ! But it seems she's got a regret for every occasion . How can we compete with that ?
Comedy and erotica are the two easiest genres to write , because your body lets you know when you're doing it well ! You don't even have to think about it . Drama's stupid hard because we don't have a drama organ that reacts when it sees good drama . I tell you , if drama was as engaging as erotica , I'd write a lot more of it .
And this generates new energy for life ?
I call it " What If Early Abrahamic Religions Had Not Been Concerned With The Origin of Sin , But Instead Contained A Viable Recipe For Cement " .
Do you ever wonder what the pillow fights are like ?
It's been a memorable two weeks indeed !
So what are your tips at small talk ?
T - Rex , you only ever call me nicknames when you owe me money .
Man , they could inherit it !
Is this conversation canon ?
What about people who hear God tell them to " lose a few pounds , chubbs " ?
It's old slang ! It means something was really good !
I do however have some tips for m -
T - REX HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALIZE IF ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN THEN ALL SPIDERS POO - BUGS AND BLOOD PARASITES MAKE IT TOO
I know , right ? There's no mistaking that THIS person is biologically male !
Suddenly I feel as if my future is full of new choices , new directions !
Guys ! There's a VOLUNTARY EXTINCTION movement . If we can decide to all stop havin' babies , then we can choose to go extinct ! !
Yeah man now people are all about orcs and vampires and wizards as they have been for like the past five years .
There's one way to find out , my friend !
EACH OF THEM SUPER AWESOME , hopefully ? ?
That's the ONE time that name would be handy .
Really ! That's quite restrained of you .
That's a terrible idea !
" Oh yeah ? Well here in the REAL world , WE don't get to rest for 32 bars ! "
But there's still free lunches : Agent X buys lunch , eats it , and is satisfied !
Sure ! But for every one of these choices - so - bad - they're - fatal , there's another universe in which it goes differently and I live .
Don't worry guys , we stored some on the moon ! !
THAT , and except for the fact that entropy is always increasing and in the end all life in the universe will be still , dead and frozen forever .
The eye doctor had told me I might need glasses !
I know ! It's so amazing !
That's kinda sketch . It can go either way but I think it veers wildly towards Sketchtowne .
Universally ? Really ?
THAT DOES NOT ERASE YOUR DEBT , MAN WITH SCISSORS
It's due to a repeated firing of the same cortex area which causes a reduction in the waterpark intensity , right ? Waterpark .
1 ) hair , if you're a mammal !
FORTY DOLLARS ?
I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER . Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations ! Oh yes . No longer .
So , how's the experiment going ?
Because if nobody saw him die then maybe he's still alive ?
And what , screw things up ? You'd probably end up stomping on the woman from which all our species are descended .
The letter probably says " Dear T - Rex , okay , let's try this again . You'll get this when you're 80 , let's see if you can come back and save me without stepping on ALL the butterflies this time , alright bitches ? ? "
You know what I don't like ?
Forget that noise . I'm going to eat something way bigger and show that stupid tractor guy how it's done . What's something bigger than a tractor ? The box the tractor comes in ?
But the new ghosts could level too !
Say you got a quick bingo , and that translates into a royal flush . You're doomed to win ! If you throw away all your cards , you're just gonna get dealt the same flush in a new suit . Even if you try to lose , the computer will step in and CHANGE YOUR CARDS , or just make you win the next game .
WILD SPECULATION PART :
Anyway , who cares ? It's spring !
I PROMISE ONLY FLAVOURED CHIPS AND HIGH ADVENTURE
" I think I had about , hugga bubba , five drinks last night " ?
CONGRATULATIONS ! !
People who get their jobs through voting think it's real important , anyway !
It appears that by informing me of my current existence within a medium of entertainment , the guest comic author has already broken the so - called " fourth wall " .
Sure it is ! I just used it while speaking English ; it is thus an English word !
I just realized : I'm almost certainly the one person who knows me the best ! This has many implications . . .
They don't ?
I haven't ruined any lives ! The kid has like bazillion parents : think about his birthday !
Aw FRIG ! !
HOLD ON A SECOND T - REX THIS IS CRAZY
hellooo0
It will be the SINGLE GREATEST PROJECT we , as a people , ever undertake !
Come on , tell me that if Santa Claus worked as a chipmunk , he wouldn't talk about ho - ho - hoarding nuts !
" A werewolf or lycanthrope ( from the Greek lycanthropos ) is a mythological creature with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or therianthropic hybrid wolf - like creature " , he read ?
She asks , " Dear Professor , why aren't our brain cells distributed throughout our bodies , making us more resistant to injury and allowing us to survive even if our heads are removed ? ? "
GOOD THING I'M NOT AVERAGE , baby ! !
It's my understanding these sayings actually refer to you , T - Rex !
Actually , my friend , I would disagree ! I think there are more productive uses of your time .
Begging the question is when what you're trying to prove is assumed implicitly in one of your premises !
And you're like " all I have done I failure . " and your bro is like " bro surely even your mistakes have value : the alternative is to make no decisions , which itself could be a mistake , so this at least gives you agency and you're like good point bro , I will no longer embrace a nihilistic death of self . "
What's going on ?
HOW ABOUT SMS ? YOU COULD ALWAYS BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE OVER SMS .
It's chilly outside ! Without a nice jacket , you might find it a little TOO easy to keep your . . . COOL ?
My true meaning was , " I bet that , had I the body type , circumstances , inclination , talent AND training , I could be an amazing ballet dancer . "
We can trace a single , vibrant line from your birth all the way back to the very origins of life on earth .
They appear to reliably take my money when I'm in need !
Let's eat a flintstone !
That WOULD pay off in intense awesomeness down the road ! Okay . I'll do it ! !
Oh , way worse , absolutely .
Which one are you going to ?
What if I'm worried my cousin is throwing her life away on a HARMFUL DRUG ADDICTION ?
" T - REX AND DROMICEIOMIMUS " starring t - rex and dromiceiomimus
The other part is if they CONTINUE to blink after the first few taps , then that's one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease .
It is so funny ! Listen . I told these jokes to a snowman and he laughed .
You were raised on fairy tales , where there were no moral grey areas , where good and bad were clear , where there was never any real doubt over which side would win in the end !
Our universe doesn't really make much sense , but it's the only one we've got ! !
We are almost certainly not living up to our potential !
First come first served ! Plus , if " handsome " is taken , you can always take " handsomer " or " handsomest " .
What if he sucks because he is a LITERAL BABY ? ? Are you going to KILL A BABY , Utah - raptor ? ?
As way of an example , I've rigged that house with a nuclear bomb that will explode when it's stomped on , and also , I'm your sister ! !
The ONLY way it could be better is if you yelled " EXTREME ! " on the way down . " Whoah ! Extreme ! ! "
Worried about getting old ? Worried the best years of your life have passed you by ?
WITH A DEPRESSED T - REX
You could say , " Hey , imagine something awesometastic " and I can say , " Wait , imagine an awesomeocracy instead ! " and then everyone will imagine my thing instead because it's better . Plus , " - cracy " INCLUDES " - tastic " . All sandwichocracies are sandwichtastic , but not all things sandwichtastic are a sandwichocracy !
. . . Oh .
But what about yourself ? You're only here because your parents selflessly decided to have children . Your very existence is against egoism .
Aren't you supposed to be the teacher here ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I give you : The Classiness Scale . Degrees are easily measured in " PC " , or " degrees pure class " !
No , feelings are emulated !
FIRST HAND REFLEXIVE :
Obviously , you can't control how explicit images are , since they're set . But , you CAN control how explicit text it , since any images there are imagined by the reader . So all you need to do is craft sexy fiction that relies on the reader generating any eroticism in the scene ! That way , they only have themselves to blame if they imagine something they think is way too sexy .
Wow , these jokes are kinda mean to PROFESSION MEMBERS !
No worries !
There are a ton of people who have died saying things like " I feel fine ! " , but irony is overdone in last words . It has to be something fresh ! Einstein spoke his last words in German , but the only person present didn't speak the language , so his last words are lost . That's actually pretty neat , I think ! I could learn some obscure language before I die and use that as a backup plan .
Being pooched is akin to being screwed !
God damn it !
You'll grow out of THAT , Utahraptor .
Maybe ADJECTIVES wouldn't force us to have such conversations !
Okay okay , so there's this monastery , with three monks , and only one monk is allowed to speak , once , each year . They take turns ! The first year , at breakfast , the first monk speaks and says " I hate oatmeal . " A year later , again at breakfast , the second monk speaks and says " I love oatmeal . " Finally , one year later , the last monk gets to speak and HE says " I'm tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal ! "
Doctor !
So I notice you're just doing the horse countries .
I really don't think it would be that fetching a look on you , T - Rex !
It's like the old saying goes ! " Let this image burn into your retina , so that you may gaze upon it endlessly , even when your eyes be closed "
Like that'll outsell MY " Medical Student Jekyll " or " The Catcher In The Empty Field That Has Just Been Planted With Rye " .
Of which little can be said because we lost most of your documents !
To tell everyone how he borrowed it from me and how now I'm never going to get it back and how he's SUCH A DICK
Who said that ? !
THE TRAGEDY OF NATURE
Whoah , what ? ! T - Rex ! That's awful !
. . . Yes ?
Heck , it's probably classical music that's supposed to give you the sad feelings !
Wait no I'm paying $ 10 for each of those too ! !
Sounds kinda dumb to to me !
Um , STOKED THAT MY LANGUAGE HAS CAUGHT ON ? ?
Hey Dromiceiomimus , care to witness a public display of affection ? I seem to see them all the time whenever I go out walking !
You have to admit you've got through a lot of houses lately !
I KINDA THINK MY VERSION IS BETTER SINCE IT HAS SUPERPOWERS
MAN this is a lot of work for trading cards
It's the guy who picks up and spins Will Smith in the credits to " The Fresh Prince of Bell - Air " !
Utahraptor , you crazy dude ! What are you doing in my epilogue ?
I know ; IT " S GREAT .
How can I possibly be late for my important meeting AGAIN ?
sadness
AT TAG
Says you ! If a woman was walking around shouting for fine new sexy dudes , she'd be chased by men from all over !
" Oh crap I just spoiled my own story ! "
Doesn't the word " tradition " remind you of Christmas ?
What is that ?
IMPOSSIBLE
Thanks to robots , love can now technically last forever !
Plus if you get to the subatomic level , my atoms are mostly empty space anyway , so really what are we but walking collections of holes at various convenient scales ?
SHORTLY . . .
definitely read to the end of this web card before putting any of this advice into action
Wow
Upon inspection : basically ? The birds DID want to eat people in his movie . But that's a scary concept , right ? Birds hungering for flesh is bad news for everyone !
This was a super big deal !
[ [ thinking ] ] kangaroo kicks
If that's where he stopped , I'd agree with you !
Not every dude is inspired by that !
IT WAS SUBTLE IRONY . Sheesh , everyone ! Subtlety !
When I drink , I tend to get sleepy , and then I tend to go to bed ! Guys !
What a brave new world it would be . . .
I can't figure out what I should be testing . What are some instincts people have ?
Imagine caring that much about one single dude
THE MOVING COMIC
Another day full of possibilities !
Nope ! I ripped off something way more awesome !
I don't know any . I mean , I know a guy some people call Maurice , but I'm not one of them .
T - That's . . .
Well , I mean , you won't last two hours without oxygen .
MEANWHILE , IN TUDOR ENGLAND :
Frig , man ! I sentence like that could make a fella feel like he's made some bad decisions !
This sounds like fun , T - Rex !
Once upon a time there was a woman called Sleeping Beauty ! Her parents named her after a specific state that she was only in sometimes . It was weird .
So - wait . Does the animal develop vocal cords ? An inferior frontal gyrus in their brains to handle syntactic processing ?
Yeah , to get away with it , all you need to be able to do is flawlessly urinate into your own mouth . Good luck with that !
Oh snap ! Wow . Classy , guys !
Movies are made by film cameras and other advanced technology !
I was being CLEVER !
By that , I mean to say that you are doing something controversial and exciting in order to get higher ratings ! I'm likening you to a TV show .
So what's the deal here , T - Rex ?
That's exactly my point ! We're RECONSTRUCTING it from hints , subtext , deduction and innuendo from his works . I CAN USE THIS .
The thought DID cross my mind !
It doesn't work on yellow , right ?
" After that maybe we can get home via . . . swan paddle boat for two ? "
Then to get your desired magnetic field you just need the planet to spin a billion times faster - at which point each day would last , oh I don't know , about 40 MILLIONTHS of a second .
Dude , narrative are given meaning by their endings ! They're the most important part !
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT PARTICULAR ASSESSMENT
That's a matter of some debate !
Boo !
Look man , I know that there's no proof . But that's the thing : if I'm right , there wouldn't be any ! And yeah you're robbing banks , but that means you're robbing obscenely rich corporations who think a stupid chequing account should cost $ 20 a month , plus their website sucks too ! Huh .
Congratulations on your book becoming the entire world's Global Narrative and Shared History , T - Rex !
At the bottom of our list are Dropletons , which are quasiparticles of electrons and holes . We all love electrons , but some of us have had bad experiences with holes . Sorry , Dropletons . Also , you sound like nerds .
And that makes me the love interest !
I've got some regrets !
There's safeties built in ! Once you approach red mist territory , the room's trampolines become merely momentum MAINTAINING .
Your point , T - Rex ?
Hey , I know this guy ! The books were probably all comics anyway , and they don't matter , right ?
Shouldn't they type " Spoiler Alert Alert " ?
Sure , I guess !
Okay , T - Rex .
Since when do you smoke ?
The year is five thousand years ago . The place : FAIRYLAND . The camera is slowly panning across a destroyed landscape .
Suppose it does , though !
An old woman holding aged lace and gazing at a faded photograph of herself , posing in her prettiest dress !
Alright - YOURS would be a video of a soggy dog , and then the dog throws up a little , and then there's a subtitle that says " BAD DECISIONS " .
Okay , Super , you're hungry ! You feel as if you've somehow avoided meeting with a terrible fate , but also as if your EVERY ACTION may result in calamity for you today . So ! Will you have cereal or toast ?
I didn't say anything !
I suggested changing the gameplay mechanics while remaking an old game .
You must have had crazy dreams before !
UH HUH
It wasn't me !
In the 15th and 16th centuries , spoken English changed dramatically , with vowels changing pronunciation and moving upwards in the mouth . Before it , we all sounded like ye olde - fashioned chumps . Afterwards , we all sounded hip and modern !
And the first - place winner has the most money , ergo , the nicest potential medal !
And " que " ?
So what bad news did you read , T - Rex ? Oil spills ? Environmental collapse ? Global warming ? Ast -
Today , gentle reader of the comic in which I am a character , ( perhaps the TITLE character ? ) we are going to break the 4th wall .
NEVER BEFORE HAS SOMEONE SO SOBER SOUNDED SO INSANELY HIGH
T - Rex , have you considered taking a creative writing course ?
PEOPLE SAY HUH MAYBE I'LL PRAY TO GOD THE GOD TODAY
But Antonio didn't say that , you did . The narrator used " ejaculated " .
I haven't ! !
DAAAANG ! !
JUST THEN , ALL RELIGIOUS DEBATES EVER ARE SETTLED FOREVER ! NICE !
She may be the perfect woman for me , but that doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone !
You know what this is ? That is making CONCESSIONS for a FLAWED PRODUCT . I would be perfect if only I could eat more chicken wings ; I'm so close I can taste it .
Well , we're officially creating culture faster than anyone can consume it .
I want Tuggy T . Tugboat to be my great success ! Spoiler Alert just feels so COMMERCIAL , you know ?
No , I don't think I'll be revealing any personal truths about myself today .
This concludes the brief history of Charles Babbage and his wonderful calculating engines !
There certainly is a lot of climate that's CHANGING , right ? Right ? ! Can I get a witness ?
I could become TRULY UNSTOPPABLE . I could read books faster AND also do well on timed tests !
Yep ! Somehow !
Right ! So that leaves us , the dinosaurs , to introduce the two species and watch one of them get gobbled ! Have we done that ? Or have we been shirking our Decadent Tops of the Food Chain responsibility of Unnatural Carnivore Pairings ?
Great !
Crowdsourcing works if you've got a really compelling idea !
Sure did !
I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here , T - Rex !
WHAT'S LEFT OF MY SANITY NEED YOU TO SAY " YES " HERE , CHAD .
One person's pretension can easily be another's well - argued piece of literature .
Listen , my tummy hurts
But that is not in the spirit of this storytelling model ! Man , look , this whole thing is unhinged now . You totally broke the CYOA format you invented . Happy ?
One month , pick a song you like , and bonus points if you can tell it's the kind of song you'll get tired of later . Listen to the song , as often as you can ! Listen to it on your headphones , play it in your head while you're walking around - whatever !
And yet , you still hate like 18 different celebrities .
Right . I'd say a good part of who a person is comes from their experiences - but if they are forgotten , where does that leave the person ?
But then Aaron said " back to you with no returns " , and I was trapped . He had delivered the insult back to me and I could not return it ! ! Anyway Sherlock Holmes heard about how this happened and decided to take the case and later he found out Aaron actually sucked out loud .
IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO :
So , Dromiceiomimus - what's up ?
Only old guys would put " hanging out " in finger quotes , T - REX .
I know , but I can't figure out a way to stop that !
Wait a second . Wait a second !
It's the best !
OKAY BUY NOW I'M SAYING FILL IN FOR A TEN YEAR OLD SQUIRREL .
I can't see what I assume you're imagining .
HMM YES I WONDER WHY ? ?
Anyway , um - one day Green Lantern found a power ring !
T - Rex , my friend , are you . . . READY FOR THREESOMES ?
Aww , you counted !
DUDE DON " T NARC ON ME LET ME FIX THIS OKAY
So she was always making her heart beat ?
THAT IS
Um - do you have any evidence ?

My autobiography , by me , T - Rex ! * ahem *
they eventually UNDERSTAND each other and HUG
Guys , this is terrible !
And I'm CALLING IN THE DEBTS , Dromiceiomimus ! I'd like my Windows for Workgroups back please .
The Temple of Artemis was one of the Seven Wonders of the World . It was this really big temple , you guys ! But it was burned down . Arson !
if i have a problem , my parents and role models always tell me that it's best to face it head on , rather than ignoring it and hoping it'll get better all on its own ! because sometimes , that doesn't happen , and then you've got an even bigger problem to deal with ! and that's just the worst
If there were an award for lateness , I would be the winner , two years in a row !
Maybe because it follows the first one ?
Ahem . Future perfect continuous passive , bitches .
It turns out my " ahappiness " idea is actually pretty close to the Buddhist idea of transcending desire ! I HAVE INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED BUDDHISM .
OKAY . MAYBE THEY DID . But that's still freaky ! They're freaky animals and you should admit it .
So - no taking back mistakes , no solving problems before they ever occur ?
30 PM )
So lay these chuckleprompts on me !
FIFTY POINTS
And when it comes to the act of physical love , Lady Gaga becomes bored if it's too tender ! !
That is to say , BASICALLY PRETTY EXCITED I GUESS !
But ! My concerns about my own lack of impact still stand !
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE INSTEAD OF SAYING " BREAKFAST " , T - REX SAID " GIRLFRIEND " :
It's a pretense for a scene of cooking - themed sex .
Oh , wow ! This means that if we can travel through time , then we can also SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE whether of not someone is actually the centre of the Universe .
But it was an accident !
Um , computers can ? ?
Absolutely not !
My parents gave it to me T - Rex the Tyrannosauroid .
Any fine new sexy ladies , please identify yourselves to me !
The Everest Eliminator is actually a pretty nice guy , huh ?
So - you're saying there is no punch line ?
I told you before ! THEIR CAR BROKE DOWN . The chicks were all coming to hang out with me in the same car to save on gas , and it broke down . That is what happens to cars sometimes !
How did he " know " ?
Our first letter comes from Joe ! Joe writes , " Dear Professor , how are time and space related ? "
And there's this passer - by who is , um , passing by , and he happens to see it . He rushes over to the crumpled car and says " Oh my God , are you okay ? ? " and the guy says " Well , I get by ! "
Oh ! And a shake - shake bootie .
W - What ?
" I was never one to believe in love at first sight , but I confess : I love your child . "
Losing at sex ! Dude ! It's right there .
There are some people who identify not as gay or straight or bisexual or what have you , but rather as asexual . I find this really interesting !
I went on a trip ? Down south ? For a week ?
GOD ! ARE THERE YET ANY LAWS AGAINST MOTHERS BEING EXTREME , DO YOU KNOW ?
Ha ha , yep ! Sure did !
BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP
Only BRIEFLY . It turns out they're meant for the elderly , not for virile young dudes ! They don't say this on the package though .
Wow , you've out - geeked an already super - geeky debate . Nice !
Logically , yes !
David woke up with the ability to read other people's minds ! He had to read them like a book though , so it kinda sucked .
Yes ! Although , you DO raise some of the fundamental problems with the theory : there's no pleasure calculus to measure happiness , especially not one that can take into account the long - term consequences of our actions .
And the sky ? That's actually a BOX AROUND YOUR HEAD that's drawn first .
The final question is " Alex Trebek's favorite thing to do is this . " Trek writes down his answer and stares out across the audience as the music plays , almost drowned out by non - stop applause . 30 - seconds later , the song ends , and in the perfect silence that follows , he reads what he wrote to the audience .
Aw shucks , accidental racisms !
" Blink " ? Pshaw . I bet you're not even XML - strict . Your doctype reads " - / / 1 . 0 MY / / ASS GOT KICKED / / "
We're going Because It's There . And also Because We Won Free Tickets From The Radio . Also because hired sherpas will do most of the work .
. . . Oh my gosh . I'm SO sorry .
Really ! Which ingredient did we use up ?
I like chicken . I could bread it , or I could roast it .
That'd give you 2500 litres . That's a lot !
But T - Rex , assuming you and the lady broke up for a reason , won't these problems still be there ?
I have some bad news !
PICK ME !
It makes sense !
OH MAN WE SO HAVE TO
Like . . . cubic millimeters ?
Well , maybe try fixing the thing so it does what you want ; that usually helps ! ! If you've now done that successfully , turn to panel 6 ! If you can't do that , then that's a new problem , and recurse one level deeper and go to panel 1 .
OR EVERY ATOM IN YOUR BODY COULD LOSE ITS COHESION AND YOU COULD EXPLODE .
Meanwhile . . .
We have , in fact , invented snowplows precisely to prevent a single storm from doing that .
I just want a peek !
We use our mouths to talk . We invent , remember and teach entire languages with which to do the talking ! And if that fails , We can TALK WITH OUR HANDS . We build planes and boats and cars and spaceships , all by either using our bodies directly , or by using instruments invented by our bodies . We compose beautiful music and tell amazing stories , all with our bodies , these fleshy bags with spooky skeletons inside !
I COULD TOTALLY BE DYING RIGHT NOW .
That's right Kirk ! And though I may think , tactically , in 2 dimensions , I can still destroy your precious Enterprise !
This is a pretty dangerous topic , isn't it ?
When Facebook holds a competition to find not just the most popular person on their site , but the most popular FAMILY , Gerald and his adult son Steve decide to try to win the million dollar prize . But they soon find out that " going viral " is enough to make you sick ! You'll laugh along to the LOLs . . . on Like Father , Like Son .
The sender of this card wants you to know they couldn't help listening in . The sound was , like - everywhere . And the sender of this card is still thinking about it the next day , enough to send you this web card . But let's not make things " weird " , okay ? Let's ALL just get past this .
Why would you say that ?
That's it exactly ! Love with an asterisk .
How so ?
I've got like a thousand REALLY GOOD REASONS for doing that
What if it does though
[ [ off - panel ] ] No I meant , what happens to the characters in the movie ?
Hello and congratulations on your purchase of a human ! Here's some advice on how to care for your new pet .
T - REX YOU'RE SO DOWN ON THESE OLD FAIRY TALES WHY DON'T YOU TRY WRITING ONE
Okay , so what's awesome is that the big orange lizards are toughest : they beat up the blue lizards and steal their girlfriend ! But the blue lizards can defend against the smaller yellow ones , AND they form stronger relationships . Meanwhile , the yellow ones are so small that they can sneak in and sex up the orange lizard's girlfriend while he's out fighting ! The blue lizard's sweeties are in committed relationships though , so Yellow can't seduce them away .
No , I'm just SUGGESTING that if a building falls on you , you might want to call her first .
Here are some things that are joyous !
It is so named because this house is a continuous sequence of rooms in which adjacent rooms are not perceptibly different from each other , although the extremes are quite distinct .
DID YOU KNOW : as a universe where wishes exist is inherently unstable , this is the best ending we could've hoped for ? ?
YES , okay ? YES . I AM BAD AT REMEMBERING NAMES .
" So Here's What I Think A Lady's Boob Looks Like "
" A Complicated Issue "
LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS today's technique : DEUS EX MACHINA
Good , nobody's around . Now I can do something REALLY embarrassing !
Science dudes , are you even listening to me ? ?
It seems I just had a snooze . . . and didn't lose !
Only if we're RACIST , T - Rex .
Irony and Nostalgia are no longer " In " . The big thing now . . . . . . Stomping !
I sometimes write " for your continued silence " !
First things's first ! We have to travel back in time to 1955 !
A homographic homophonic autantonym is a word that is spelt AND pronounced the same , but has two opposite and contradictory meanings ! For example , I can dust a crop ( adding pesticides to it ) , or I can dust a counter ( removing dust from it ) ! Way to go , dust ! You are a winner ; you are a word that contains multitudes .
Um . OK . Let's go back to my place , and I'll make some tea .
Yeah . I don't - I don't understand what you're going for with it . Why are you a girl ? And why would you compare puberty to a nightmare in the first place ? You've had some success with it .
I'm just sayin' !
Okay , so we mix it up some ! The lady takes a not - so - classy guy and turns him into a classy LADY ! Whoah , what just happened ! I know I'M intrigued !
This is one situation where men have the clear gender advantage !
I have one word for you , my friend !
You've done stuff , T - Rex !
English ! What the HELL ?
How was your weekend , Utahraptor ?
Did you know that , CANONICALLY , God can make animals talk whenever he wants ?
MMM
Science just needs to invent a low - fat ice cream alternative . OH WAIT , THEY DID , IT'S CALLED GELATO .
There sure is a lot I don't know about . . .
We've all changed ! It makes me more nostalgic for how things were before , just a year or two ago . Not because things were better , but because they were different ! I always feel like I missed some opportunity , like I could have done something then that I can't do now .
I will soon !
TIME FOR MUTUAL KISSES .
This first part is AMAZING ! !
It's cool
WAY too sweet , Utahraptor .
DROMICEIOMIMUS AND T - REX WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING COOL
I had to choose from the gender spectrum , and I did !
Hello future generations ! Depending on how far in the future you live you may know me as a senior citizen or even a combination skeleton / ghost , but at the time I'm saying these words I'm a young dude ! I'm young and cool !
I'm not gonna stop ! I'm going to show people that the reason I stomp on things is because stomping on things is TRULY EXCELLENT . You should try it !
BELIEVE ME
There's the opposite too : heterological words that DON'T describe themselves , like " long " !
Okay . Well , Mario's a well - known character , but you have specialized knowledge about him . Why not exploit this in art you produce ?
sorrys ahoy . "
I get them custom made , DROMICEIOMIMUS .
MALE NUDITY ? ?
Use me as an illustration in your children's story called " The Dude Who Never Listened To His Parents And Grew Up To Be Someone Who , Even When Meeting A Grocery Store Full Of Complete Strangers , Would Instantly Be Despised By Them , And Those Strangers Would All Be Totally Right In Doing So ! "
So what do you recommend ?
Assuming that time isn't ACTUALLY changing , this means that my brain has the incredible ability to slow down my perception of time ! I must harness this , Dromiceiomimus !
THAT IS SO NOT WHAT I SAID
The idea is that it's like a moving sidewalk , but the speed is computer controlled ! So you hop on your skateboard and get on the track , and within a few moments the speed of the treadmill is exactly matching the speed your board would otherwise be travelling at ! You're not moving , but the board FEELS like it's travelling at speed .
I don't think you can keep this up !
AT THE WEDDING .
SO IF YOU SLOWED DOWN THE EARTH YOU WOULDN'T GET AN EXTRA HOLIDAY
I'M NOT .
I agree !
You know , if a plan involves the words " harvest of babies " , then a cool thing I do is I abandon the idea .
A nice benefit of this is that free will is reduced to a complete illusion , since everything anyone ever does is already decided . On the plus side , this means that you can decide to do anything you want , because you're not responsible for it ! But on the minus side , it means that you can't ever ACTUALLY decide to do anything . Thank , determinism !
Did they have a case of the crazies ?
Nutrition : the opposite of extinction !
Argh ! So frustrated !
This is all about rugby ?
Yes , there are many differences between adults and children !
I gotta go lie down and process it for a while .
Anyway , a woman named Agnodice lived there .
Comedy relies on surprise , I think ! There's a twist that makes a joke funny , and I haven't figured out a generative algorithm yet .
Inventing food can be tricky !
The SHAFT upon which the seat is MOUNTED has become bent !
Sometimes it can be hard to name characters . Here's a tip : name them after other , more famous characters , and add in some Roman numerals ! If you want to show that a character is tough , name him Genghis II . If your character is this big lover guy who has fallen for , um , a 14 - year - old , call him " Romeo IV " ! Hey presto ! Suddenly your characters write themselves !
T - REX IF YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT US THEN YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED
TAKE ME WITH YOU
I think your problem is you're focusing on plot !
That - that IS pretty cute !
I toss you some crayons and ask you to draw me a picture of a grassy field on a clear day with the sun shining down from above . POP QUIZ , HOTSHOT : which colour crayons do you use ?
T - REX LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ALL VIDEOGAMES ARE ACTUALLY JUST MURDER SIMULATORS
It is impossible to know if my dream came true
Well , have you tried getting rid of him ? Hey T - Rex , isn't it great how the Devil is PRETTY LAME ?
God asked !
We share the laughter AND the tears , Utahraptor .
Also good !
$
Can we talk about Easter Island ?
( THIS IS A REFERENCE TO ANOTHER , UNRELATED FABLE . )
YES . This is gonna be great ! !
WHAT T - REX DOES WHEN HE WANTS SOMEONE NOT TO LIKE HIM ANYMORE :
I am against giving your sweetie flowers when you are in a relationship . Oh God ! Think of the symbolism !
Um . . . " neat " ?
Motorcycle enthusiasts tell each other apart by their helmet " street tags " !
But one scientist is studying aging and makes the stupendous discovery that every time we make a mistake , we get older . It's like this law of the universe that encourages the evolution of perfect beings . If we could somehow stop making mistakes , we'd never die !
Anyway .
Vampires are in , right ? That's not too passe ? We're not all into ants that have combined themselves together to form the shape of a giant ant yet ? Yes ?
My base is going to be better !
But what about foreshadowing ? Denouement ? SYNECDOCHE ?
Okay so the first is . dogs , obviously . It's so obvious that I'm surprised I even have to say it .
" Wasn't she the best ever ? "
You know what the top two prizes for math are ?
Hey brain , this is me , the conscious part !
And this is why I have abandoned my research into holodecks and am going to spend all my time working on lucid dreaming instead .
Girl are you Magic the Gathering because I could see myself spending a lot of money and the better part of my 20s on you
Is " whom " a necessary English construction ? Its role as object is already indicated by syntax .
I'm glad we're friends !
That only works if we're ultra popular , but we're just two dudes who decided in the past 60 seconds to learn some new languages for no real reason !
Oooh , what's this , a sheep ? What are you going to do , PUNCH ME ?
I'm still thinking about Chris P . Bacon
But " aging " isn't the only way to die , right ?
On my deathbed I'll say " Aw man , I always thought I'd go back in time and mess with history " , and then hopefully I'll disappear in a flash of temporal light because , actually , I've just gone back in time to mess with history .
You know what'd be great ? A restaurant that serves gourmet versions of classic comfort foods , like burgers and fish and chips !
What's that , computer ? Updates are available to be installed ?
Yeah , but it's such a sensational disease ! Maybe we should - I don't know , try to be less sensational about it . We shouldn't be making jokes .
And let me guess : at the end the Earth explodes ?
. . . oh .
? That's what they're like !
Oh no you didn't !
What do you mean , whatever ? They tell you when food has gone bad . If you ignore them , you're eating expired food , and that's gross .

T - REX THAT LINGUISTIC PREMISE IS FULL OF LIES
YES . Motion passes !
Yep ! It's not going to be that big of a party , but I thought people might be in high demand , so I'm asking now .
Genetic Engineering ! It's SO EASY .
Oh , perfect ! Just what I'm looking for . Lay it on me !
NEVER SLEEP WITH A WIZARD .
Welp , I guess childhood is over for me !
Only I don't really know who's gonna win tomorrow's horse race !
None that matter , T - Rex . Not anymore .
But what IS awesome is the idea of a ghost who just wants to be buried , but who , despite this one consuming desire , also can't resist pulling the old " increasing mass piggyback ride " prank .
daaaaaamn
They're our best evidence for what happens when people respawn ! They prove that people have A LOT OF FUN .
One event ?
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
To be honest , all I want is a punchline that doesn't rely on reminding me of what I liked when I was 7 !
Demand is high , so scientists have taken the extraordinary step of broadcasting their process live on TV . You can go to bars and watch the experiment unfold with other fans who are rooting for the same hypothesis you are , cheering as the results come in !
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Hands up if you want to go into space ! ! Wait , hold on , I'll answer for everyone
Mmm ?
Parallel to all this , AS USUAL , is 50 % through 50 % dark chocolate in strict 0 . 5 % increments . So ! Did we win the bet , God ?
There's only enough for me !
I've got boner fever ! !
And if you live INFINITY YEARS , the chance of you dying from it becomes 1 : TOTAL CERTAINTY .
Ah well , it had a good run . Now onto the next new thing !
What ? Says who ? ?
How'd she get pregnant in the first place ?
They have a name for that : REALITY .
Quit stomping on people !
It was unexpected but gratifying !
Oh boy ! You've justifies being uncouth ! Who cares about the past 1000 years of evolving social graces ?
Man , the coolest thing ever ?
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE THE TRUTH LIES
In the book , I tell people that the key to being awesome is to do awesome things at awesome times .
They use it as a free point - to - point transporter !
But NOW , we understand things ! We don't need a God to make hurricanes and babies for us . We can make them in a lab !
SERIOUSLY ? ?
Okay , yes ! I can see that !
you look : poorly drawn
WE HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW
KARGO KULT KOMICS
COMIC IN WHICH THE DEAD COME BACK TO LIFE TO HARASS THE LIVING
They've got a stretchy body to eat animals way bigger than themselves . When you said " nightmare without end " I thought you'd seen one .
They're stopping the flow of information to literally ask RANDOM STRANGERS what they think . The only way it'd be acceptable is if they prefaced these stupid segments with " and now , here's what some strange folks on their way to do something better had to say ! " but THEY NEVER DO .
There was a time when we didn't know which organ did what ! We cut open our bodies and we were like " whoah , THAT'S a hot mess . I have no IDEA what's going on in there . "
Not always ! At restaurants I like to " sweeten the pot " , and that little kickback is taken . Every . Single . Time .
Okay now , bring it back to dudes ! !
DINOSAUR COMICS CHARACTER GENERATOR
Psych ! Actually I just wanted to talk to YOU : the NSA intern who monitors everything I say and type and every website I access ! It's really sweet that you care so much about me . You watch the T - Rex show every day , and you never miss an episode , a moment , a single word . I love that when we go to bed each night we're both going over the same day in our heads , thinking the same thoughts , sighing the same contented sigh before falling asleep . I love that . I love you .
Forensic anthropologists want to study how bodies decompose in different circumstances ! And so they go to their neighborhood BODY FARM , which is basically just a few acres of land surrounded by a fence and filled with DEAD AND DECOMPOSING BODIES . Some are out in the open , others are underwater or entombed or whatever ! And scientists come and science up the joint , and I'LL be the guy who holds a torch under his face and says " Welcome to my farm of death and decay . "
Sure , why not ?
We all know what anthropomorphism is , dude !
You're not supposed to go around killing people if you're a Buddhist . It's the first of the Ten Precepts !
Aww , T - Rex ! It'll be okay !
TOMORROW :
They're just so WRONG . They're causing unnecessary pollution in an area that already probably has problems with air quality , PLUS , they're congesting the road and making our cities more corporate and less beautiful . They're ugly , and the whole idea is self - centered , and thoughtless , and the worst kind of capitalism .
GREETINGS T - REX WHAT IS DUCK HUNT
Could it be ? Could it be true that the Dromiceiomimus has a crush on me ?
" Mr . Shoplifters ? " That's what I landed on ? ?
Come 'ere , you !
So what's this specific breed of nostalgia called ?
For you see , the woman represents years of build - up of grime and dirt . By stomping on her I illustrate cleaning power - not of any household cleaner , but of simply applying yourself !
So who likes poutine ?
Wait ! That's it !
Yeah ! What IS up with the jerks ?
I'M DOWN WITH FALL TOO T - REX
Oh man , I haven't bought anyone any presents yet ! I AM SO POOCHED ! I am the worst friend in the world .
Yes it is .
LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS
It sounds like this comforts you !
Haha , that's cool ! Well , I guess I'll see you tomorrow : Christmas Eve ! I have a very special present for you , my friend .
You justify your destruction via science ?
I'm pretty sure you're not actually undead , Morris ! Normally zombies can't talk .
Well , then , I guess I'd face a choice !
YO , I'M IN
And she'll be so happy ! It's IMPOSSIBLE to be angry when surrounded by chicken wings ! ! It's impossible , Utahraptor . I've tried it .
REVENGING MYSELF UPON MY ENEMIES , THAT IS !
Wow , that's an unexpectedly mature response . I figured you'd wish for " happy women with steaks " or something !
Nine times out of ten , yep . You're second to none , T - Rex !
Yo , I thought I was just getting bigger !
THE MAKEOUT EXPRESS TAKES ON PASSENGERS AT KISSFACE STATION , ALL UP ONS CIRCLE , AND LIPLOCK LANE .
I don't know where you'll get the data you need .
I guess I was young and believed no woman could ever find me attractive of her own volition !
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THE PLANTS NEED MANUAL POLLINATION
How come car bumpers aren't all at the same height on cars ? It's dumb that they're not . The whole point of bumpers is to cushion bumps , but if they don't meet , then they only serve as Impact Hasteners .
Your problems just seem to - escalate , huh ?
Because it's not like they're getting any better .

He always seemed to have an . . . abiding sorrow .
" I wonder if we can ever find a common ground , " Angola mused , pointing his gun at Brussels . " Unlikely , " Brussels replied , pointing his own gun at Angola , " as it's been my observation that people tend to calcify into their beliefs as they get older . " " There are exceptions though , " Angola said as he cocked his gun . Brussels nodded . " There are always " - here he cocked his gun too - " exceptions . "
She called me " lovely " yesterday !
Did you see him last weekend ?
My mind's being blown over here !
The boats can turn into SUBMARINES , Dromiceiomimus .
A device that only causes pain ?
I'd be wasting my money !
Here in the present , Dromiceiomimus is still missing !
But T - Rex , crushing things isn't fundamentally altering our universe .
Today is the day I bought Dromiceiomimus some pants !
" Incurable eating trailblazer . Unashamed drinking evangelist . Diehard freelance music ninja . "
Well , there are many ways of living , but those are lifestyle choices , not truths ! All you're really doing is applying the label of truth to circumstances , desires and trends . The truths you're looking for are more universal , aren't they ?
I HAVE MAN
How come all your fantasies involve you becoming fantastically rich ?
Okay , so this man gets into a car accident and wraps his car around a telephone pole !
No , but -
Well , good news , friend ! While we are stuck on this planet for now , you CAN get as far away from everyone else as is possible , thanks to the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility ! This is the point on the ocean that's furthest away from all land . All around you is water , and the rest of us are far , far , away . Furthest furthest away , actually ! Unless you go to the moon , but the GOVERNMENT doesn't let us do that yet .
Really ? So if I have , say , a papier - m ? ch ? pi ? ata dog filled with tasty candies , your duplicator ray will make a PERFECT duplicate ?
" boxing kangaroo " ? !
Oh well ! ? Language : it's weird ! ?
I think Chuckles would know that !
Aw frig ! Someone has mashed up Jay - Z's " Dirt Off Your Shoulder " and the 1 - 1 theme from Mario 3 ! Suddenly my current crush and the death of my first dog have become irrevocably mixed ! !
It's an easy way for you to meet new dudes ! If you move to a new town and want to meet some dudes then you can go to the site and then you can meet some . On the COMPUTER !
My suggestion : " K - RAY - Z " !
We sure have some good times , eh ?
" OKAY , THANKS FOR WRITING IN TO TELL ME WHAT ALL THE DEALS WERE WITH YOUR BABIES "
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL VERSE FOR KIDS TO SING ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO DIE IN BATTLE AND SHARE THEIR PARENT'S COFFINS .
What really happened ?
Now that's OBJECTIVELY SADDER : everyone's dead , not just one baby !
Heck yes ! I'm largely in favour of it !
TOO EASY , man ! Seriously , you should join us in our wacky cheque world . It's great !
And they threw a bunch of stuff overboard !
Nope ! He's still asleep .
Oh well .
T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR REMAINED GOOD FRIENDS
B - busy ?
So we understand sound before we understand images , assuming they reach our senses at the same time !
That's not a real thing
and whose friends are FRIGGIN' CASUALS
As a character in a comic , you have no true free will of your own . Nor do you think at all ! It is the author that will com up with the joke .
That means the Dromiceiomimus -
Great ! The world will applaud my skill , but bemoan the fact I wasted SO MUCH of my life not doing the one thing I was great at !
Pretty clever , boys ! !
I would much rather consider the precise nature of my thirst . It's - strong ! Insistent .
I've met someone new !
# OTHERPEOPLIES
Someone comes in and says " Boo hoo I have trouble with one or more of my RELATIONSHIPS " , and what do I say ? I say " How does that make you feel ? " and they say " Sad " and I say " But talking about it makes you feel better , right ? " and they say " A little , I guess " and I say " Excellent ! CASE CLOSED . "
Hunger isn't an emotion .
T - REX'S GREAT IDEA
One spooky Hallowe'en night Robyn was digging in her back yard when she uncovered . . . A HUMAN SKULL . And unlike most skulls , this one began gushing blood from its eye sockets and was constantly , breathlessly screaming the second it was exposed to air .
Ooh , that IS impressive ! What's your usual order ; what kind of place is it ?
I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value !
I would like it if the chumpified chicks and dudes were true to other selves , please .
Sometimes I don't reply to emails and then tell people that my spam filter got them . YOU may quote me .
There he could read Wikipedia , which was a thing now !
It takes us MONTHS to learn how to walk , and that's just for one body ! Change all the variables at once and there's no way . Heck , if breathing wasn't automatic I'd expect we'd all suffocate to death as soon as we switched !
Last night was the best party ever !
So much , Utahraptor !
We put potatoes in boiling grease and serve them in a cardboard sleeve at Burger King
Yes
A MASTERY OF TORSIONAL TWISTING IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE VICTORY
Welcome to the world , babies ! It turns out being alive means you keep your mouth moist with your own juices , only sometimes it's too much juices , so you chug 'em into your belly and feed on them like they're food . Sometimes it happens while you sleep !
Don't you worry about it , Champ ! Here , have some Lego . If you try super hard , you can get some to stick together !
There - -
. . . what if one of the people involved is a jerk ?
I can imagine !
Listen , let's make a Facebook event for a decade out that says " SELF , IF YOU ARE STILL ON FACEBOOK WHEN THIS EVENT HAPPENS , THEN WE HAVE MADE SOME BAD FRIGGIN' DECISIONS . "
What are you waiting for ? Turn to Panel 6 !
Why stop at cities ? What if there was a man who could bench press . . . entire PLANETS ?
Except Shakespeare did most of his writing before dictionaries !
I did not know that .
Maybe they could send us chocolates instead of email ! Because we all hate spam !
WHATEVER DUDE NORSE MYTHOLOGY HAS F ? FNIR THE TALKING DRAGON
Wait - you believe in racism ?
Oh , okay
Looks like you win that argument !
Aww boo !
Maybe ! Mostly I see elements of myself .
I think it would be great to have my last words planned out in advance . They'd have to be really memorable , so that people would keep talking about them , and by extension me !
That's because I am !
Did you know there are only seven different stories ? It's true ! All stories are variations on these narratives !
But it's a risk you've got to take , as there exists , unfortunately , no secret word for sexy times .
Man ! I need to stop making all the mistakes . Today is NO MORE MISTAKES FOR T - REX DAY .
I know ! That's actually really good !
But then I remember that actually no , it's super great !
Our bodies are amazing things !
Now what you see is pretty cool : I'm talking with a flag ! I'm gonna tell you all a joke and bring new meaning to " sight gag " !
( Gibberish )
remember these comics ? DON'T YOU WISH THEY HAD ENDED DIFFERENTLY ? ?
You make this ONE MAN do your bidding , changing the climate as effectively as possible !
Man ! If I were a robot , a lot of things would be different .
It's called a " love dart " and they literally grow it inside their own bodies . Scientists were like , " oh , it delivers sperm " - but NOPE . Then they were like , " oh it's a . . . gift ? Of . . . calcium ? " but NOPE . Turnout the dart - that sometimes GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH THEIR HEADS TO STICK OUT THE OTHER SIDE - has mucus on it , and that helps sperm survive .
Then , sandwiches !
oh no oh no oh no ! I lost the baby I was sitting ! I am the world's worst babysitter !
Does " like zero presents " include me ?
HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE STRAWBERRIES T - REX
You managed to break material SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to be as strong as possible , and you did it by ACCIDENT . Would you trust yourself with a baby ? Would ANYONE ?
Can do , Facebook Shakespeare !
- AND the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to !
Technically , yes .
but is blocked in this desire by a ( n )
. . . Wait .
The water heater's leaking and my showers are all cold !
Um , maybe if you were lazier and hungrier . . . ?
Right ! Increased temperature , rising sea levels , and - OH GOD .
You're one of MY super friends , T - Rex !
Parents ! Have you named your offspring yet ? ? Because if not , good news :
These sound really bad .
Listen , I just thought you should know that " The Elements of Style " is based on my own " Periodic Table of Grammatical Swag " ?
Okay YES I KNOW DREAMS ARE STUPID , but bear with me !
I'm really looking forward to this !
But the fun thing of bingo is in dabbing the numbers , in building up suspense as the game progresses . You've made it boring !
Is & # 8212 ;
But
You roll the dice , and then the game plays itself . The players have no influence on how the game goes ; in every meaningful sense you are redundant . Is it a metaphor for the futility of dreams ? All we know for sureis if you've ever wanted to roll the dice and do nothing else , then this is the game for you .
But I've got great names for everyone else's hypothetical sons !
We're trying to kill the vampires during the day when they're the most vulnerable - but they fight us in the shade . So instead , we attack at night !
Something's got to be done about my kids !
Hullo T - Rex ! Do you know what kind of waves wash up on Tiny Towne's Beaches ?
You don't need kids of your own -
You will symbolize change through repetition ?
NOOOOOOOOO
All passed away , leaving behind only things others thought were worth preserving , if any , and memories of themselves in the minds of their equally mortal friends .
Laura Mulvey !
Wouldn't it be funny if I planted A FAKE GRAVE for future generations to discover ?
YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM AND HE'S AWESOME
You'd also have to deal with sexual prejudice , T - Rex ! All your bragging about your sexual prowess and " memorable lovemaking techniques " would probably make people think you're kind of slutty !
Can't we all just agree that Raphael is cool ? But , ON OCCASION , he can also be crude .
That's very clear ! And instead of saying " I'm sad " you can say " I'm a friend of Aquaman's . "
" The lyre is that weird U - shaped harp you're probably thinking of , " Apollo added .
I could say this is one situation in which the free market fails ! But I won't !
Our team lost , badly , and everyone blamed me . But how is that fair ? Any TEAM sport is broken if one player can ruin the game ; I should be able to influence no more than 1 / $ numplayers of the total score !
Yo yo , T - Blech ! Can you help me and my home dinoz stomp out all the humans ? If they don't die out soon , we'll lose the survival competition to these upstart primates , dawg !
I don't want to waste my time on art that sucks ! !
PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON NON - MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIPS :
Super neat !
Nuh - uh ! The real question is this :
Ooh ! T - Rex ! I know the longest word in the dictionary !
No
T - REX DID YOU KNOW THAT ANYONE CAN SEND OUT A PRESS RELEASE
Thanks , subconscious !
WHAT DID THAT SAY ? Did that say there will be a dinosaur at the end of this comic ?
CORRECT SOME DAMN APHORISMS
I wonder if when he was alive he had any advice for us , the future generations !
? !
I hear you , man !
Well , I can't stop now ! Besides if I DO come back as a poo bug , then there's not much damage I can do , right ? Maybe I'll get stomped on by some other dude pretty quickly and it'll be so TRAGIC that next time I get to be an awesome T - Rex again .
It's like your gums were replaced with green peanut butter
Me ?
Fine ! Fine .
It could happen ! Think about it !
And I am the kind of tableau , my friends ! Check it out :
But I remember sitting there when I was sixteen or so , with some stranger's fingers in my mouth as he scraped away at my teeth and thinking " MAN , this is a sucky time ! I wish I had something to distract me . I bet if I'd had sex , then I could think about sex , and that would be distracting . Hey ! I should have sex ! It'll make visits to the dentist easier . "
NICE
T - REX PRESENTS : JOKE . . . OR NIGHTMARE SCENARIO ? ?
You mean love ? Possessive monogamous romantic love ?
Any saying with " always " in it can be trivially disputed ; a single counter - example is all that is required .
Why don't you look at what sort of online ads get the biggest response ?
It's my SPECIALTY , baby !
Oh my gosh I just found out about a political form that beats democracies AND pornocracies combined ! It's the best . THE BEST .
YES . Yes it probably would !
Yaaaaay
Girl , is there a piece missing ? It hurts a lot .
Just like how everyone in the 20s was a flapper ! !
What could be more terrifying than being crushed by a T - Rex ?
Specifically , revenging myself upon my enemies by finding out what their full names are , and then popularizing an insulting or embarrassing acronym that uses those initials .
What if they , you know ?
Not just stuff : UNIQUE stuff !
T - REX AND THE GUY WITH THE WORLD'S MOST PUNCHABLE FACE
In space prison !
True !
Instead he worked to be the best person he could be , which is all any of us can do , and over time he managed to let go of some of his resentment !
They all suck !
The silent screams of millions ?
I think we've made our environment so predictable and safe that there's no real opportunity to go where nobody's been before , to see things that haven't been seen . It's too bad ! I want ADVENTURES !
The chase was on motorbikes for a while and then on skateboards . Then they chased on hang gliders . A bystander told his wife it was the best chase ever and she knew it was true . They were chasing on foot again when it ended . Utahraptor arrested T - Rex , but T - Rex explained how the bank was evil . The cop thought now I am torn between the law and what I believe is right . What do I do now ! Utahraptor let T - Rex go with a warning . T - Rex said thanks I have learned my lesson . The mystery was solved , except for one part : where would the spirit of adventure take T - Rex next ? ?
Daaaaaamn !
Shit certainly DOES go foul sometimes , you guys
As the old saying goes , " If it starts with an 'F' . . . then do what it says , Steph ! "
MMORPGs are already really popular and addictive - some people play them upwards of eight hours a day . Throw in a casino where you can not only win REAL money but also rare in - game items and experience points , and you've merged two addictions into one , feeding them into each other ! It'll be a terribly effective way to make profits from those with addictive personalities .
That's awesome ! Like the old saying goes , once you have warp field technology , all your problems start to look like nails that could have warp field technology applied to them .
We DESERVE more emojis .
Then she realized : overpopulation ! With over seven billion humans on her planet all at once and only so many ways to be , there had to be an approximation of Timmy out there with her preferred changes implemented . So she travelled the world to find him !
So it's in my interest to outbid him with 3 cents : that way I can at least make a profit of 97 cents !
We're searching for a nuclear bomb ! ?
Running up behind you like that ?
Who here would like to hear an old joke about oatmeal ?
" In all of my adventures , " Sherlock explained , " EVEN WHEN SPECIFIED OTHERWISE , Watson and I were actually dressed up like Bat - Man and a weird giant bird . " THE END .
So he picks up a more advanced book ?
Yeah , " why " , as in " why move away and start life again ? " What , did you commit some horrible crime ?
And this one aunt keeps buying me chocolates and I'm like , yo , I have plenty of chocolate already , can't we hang out and be chill without you buying me things I don't need ? Is it so weird to want that ? Am I crazy ? ?
A millennium passing is , to us , as unremarkable as the passing of a single day !
Isn't it ? It was signed " J - HARTIGAN " , but nobody around had that name . Someone with his description HAD bought strychnine from a pharmacy a few weeks back though .
We're only getting a few inches of snow , T - Rex ! This is not the end of civilization .
Ask me ANYTHING .
Actually , T - Rex , non - monogamy doesn't automatically mean " now you can have sex with everyone without consequences " , it usually means " I'm not going to demand exclusivity of you , but we still need communication and trust , and , as in any relationship , I can be hurt " . You can still cheat . We talked about this .
I guess you could say your remarks are . . . RIGHT ON THE MONEY ?
Hey , whatever happened to Ben ?
The freshest words keep falling of out my head !
Maybe I'll get nominated for a Nobel prize soon too !
THURSDAY :
But . . . what if Chubby Dude is the one who messed with the train's brakes ?
as arranged from best to worst
But I never drink that much !
The propinquity effect refers our tendency to from romantic attachments with people we encounter and interact with often .
For reals !
in comic form , baby
Shit , no !
I see it more like , every tasty thing in the universe is God , and I'm getting HUNGRY .
T - REX DO YOU THINK PIXEL ART CAN EVER BE RECOGNIZED AS A TRUE VALID AND ESSENTIAL ART FORM
Playing by my own rules is fun !
" All problems stem from reality not living up to our hopes and dreams . Either change reality or your hopes and dreams : in other words suck it up , AND / OR , walk it off . THE END . "
T - REX DID YOU FORGET THAT I AM GOD AND THAT READING OLD MAGAZINES IS SOMETHING ONLY NON - GODS DO
And I have some good dirt on the Dromiceiomimus !
Can that actually happen ?
I know ! ! It just sort of - happened .
Here is some handy slang for you , teens ! " Bad " means " good " . For example , " that rock concert was BAD ! " Further , " bogus " means " bad " , but these aren't transitive . Something that's bogus isn't good . " Bodacious " means " good " , but these aren't symmetric either . A salad might be bodacious if it's exceptional , though .
Let us assume that everyone alive today has two biological parents , a mother and a father . I will call this the " No Cloned Chicks " hypothesis !
FRIG that'd be awesome . I love fixing stuff I didn't even break ! !
Agent Mulder from TV's X - Files went forward in time to when there's wars between the very stars themselves ?
Not everything has to have continuity , Mammuthus Primigenius .
That's pretty amazing !
Because they're waiting for the hospital ?
I'm not a terrible person , Utahraptor ! If you died playing chess I'd be sad , obviously ! But also happy , because I KICKED YOUR ASS STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVE .
If you want to walk around with your arms outstretched , stop reading and go do that . If that is honestly a priority for you right now then I'm not going to stop you . But if you want to explore how you're alive , given the fact that you a ) already died once and b ) your flesh has become desiccated , let's get down to it . Let's do this . Let's unwrap one of your fingers .
I regret spilling a glass of ginger ale on an architect !
That's really odd , isn't it ? What do you suppose it means ?
Although I have written things like " nudity tax " when I didn't want the person to cash the cheque .
( That means " Free time : maybe I've too much of it ? " )
It was insane . I never get road rage , bicycle or otherwise , and I never flip anyone off ! But here I was being all that I hate ! I flipped him off without even looking behind , and THEN , after I flipped him off he honked at me again , two little ones , and I flipped him off again , two little ones . Then I turned left and got away !
Time for some . . .
Because after over a century of phoning it in , the " auto - mobile " will finally live up to the promise of its name ? ?
Shakespeare ! Are you listening to your MP3s again ? !
This is no time for hilarious word - play !
NOAH
T - REX PLEASE INFORM YOUR COMPANION THAT DABBLING IN MACHINE - ASSISTED RUNS IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF HERESY
LATER , T - REX IS TRYING TO DISCOVER ESSENTIAL TRUTHS AND IT'S SO HARD :
That's pretty wild !
But , you know , that's his fault , right ? He didn't CAPITALIZE on it . But I would have ! I'd have the extinguishers say " Remember T - Rex ? He was so great , wasn't he guys ? " every time they were use . Just a soft reminder - nothing too loud !
No what ?
A vertical wall that goes down a few kilometres , and then what ?
Man , we're going !
You want to kiss on someone rad ? Okay !
Autosexual :
As he never wished for an end to suffering , Aladdin TRULY IS history's greatest monster .
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX WATCHES THIS OTHER T - REX'S LIFE ON TV :
T - Rex , that's a dad joke . Only dads say jokes like that ! He's opening up to you . You gotta play this right , homeslice !
Let's say you're playing chess with someone , and suddenly they have a fatal heart attack . This is the best possible way to win , you guys !
But T - Rex , um , you and I don't really have - -
T - Rex , aren't you being - ah , kind of racist ?
FRIG THAT
MEANWHILE , IN A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE !
Great ! Let's talk about that instead !
It's " kinda " made from ground - up mummies ?
Well T - Rex , I think you're here - as I think we're all here - in order to make the world a better place . That is the purpose of life , I believe !
Well , I'm not sure what I was expecting . Oh wait , yes I do ! I WAS EXPECTING TO LEAVE MY INCREDIBLY CREEPY RACOONO - CEPHALOPOD NEIGHBOURS BEHIND . They followed me , Dromiceiomimus ! THEY moved to the place next to MY new place !
Sure , knock yourself up !
It's a little thing called a " METAPHOR " , Will . Man ! Study literary techniques much ? ?
We can't get rid of them !
Not bad ! And I could have a spooky tape , but instead of chainsaws and screams , I'd have the voice of a man quietly dictating memories of his youth , knowing Alzheimer's will rob him of them soon .
And before you say " adjective phrases can't fully replace noun semantics " , let me warn you : THIS ONE CAN .
I hadn't expected the conversation to go this way , but . . . maybe ?
Uh - huh . And the second ?
You were !
? This sentence is a lie ! ?
Full - potential happy , eh ? Hmm !
I know it ! !
He's a robot ! He's a robot and he sits on the kitchen counter and when I press the " Breadmatic , I would like some bread tonight " button and then put the ingredients inside him , he turns them into bread . You know how he does it ? Through ROBOTICS .
You - you dedicated BIBLE II to me ? I'm not sure how I feel about that .

Has there ever been a situation in which a tiger has eaten a penguin ?
There are a few moments in my life at which , I can now see in hindsight , critical events took place .
Thanks for including me in your title , T - Rex .
No ! They're just different people ! You wouldn't get along . They like rocking and you -
Dromiceiomimus is that way , dude !
Just think about it ! " Polluted " ? Eww ! ! And what does " excited " mean when applied to meat ? It just raises too many questions .
UNTIL THEY SEE AN IMMORTAL ARMY OF PISSED - OFF GHOSTS MATERIALIZE BESIDE US ! Dude , throw in a love story and you've got a bestselling trilogy IN THE BAG ! !

Cephalopods ? Like squid ?
Okay that's awesome . But my language can still be awesome too ! I'll just go in a different direction .
Yes indeed , the balls of my feet are free AND unrestricted
Sir this is not how grocery stores work
Oh boy , am I ever glad I read the news today ! I certainly am happy with all the terrible things happening in the world today . Attention , everyone within the sound of my voice ! I was attempting :
Robots send robots back in time to kill AND / OR SAVE the motherboard of the robot that will one day prevent robots from overthrowing robots . YES . I am SO DOWN .
. . . THEN HOW COULD CINDERELLA LEAVE A GLASS SLIPPER BEHIND * AFTER * MIDNIGHT ? ?
. . . to ignore my provocation and leave me alone , that is !
Utahraptor ! Are these questions rhetorical , or are you actually asking me for reason why we shouldn't do this ?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
AS IF anyone would read that when they can read MY " A Tale Of wo Small Villages " and " The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn , Precocious Toddler " ! !
You haven't ?
T - Rex , this is a RAP BATTLE . You're supposed to come at me with some sick rhymes of your own ! You're not supposed to compliment me on my rhymes and then ask to borrow them .
It is now ! It is if that's the format I have to use to tell my readers that they're scared !
That's a syllable savings of over 42 % !
You totally like actors if you like their characters , and vice versa . Come on , follow me . I'll prove it .

Dude I can see what you're doing here , but the problem with galaxies is that they're mostly empty space . You can't blast your pecs with one because you couldn't actually hold it .
Another beautiful day : such nice sun , a fresh scent in the air , and I'm out for a walk !
After the success of my role of " Tony " , the hard - living mechanic , I have won another role !

But is this poetry contest for political poems or for , you know , poems about the sky and how magical it is to wake up in the morning ?
CLUMSY
Plus pills don't recreate texture .
I think we're good to go !
LATER : EVERYONE GETS INVITED TO A WEDDING EXCEPT T - REX .
For what ?
Can you just tell me how it tastes , when you put THAT in your pipe and smoke it ?
It is ! But here's my angle : let's say there's a catastrophe and everyone dies . When Future Folks dig up my house , I will throw their historical understanding into chaos ! They will say " HOW COULD A CAVE MAN OWN A RENAISSANCE - ERA PAINTING AND A COMPUTER WITH AN ASTROLABE STUFFED IN IT ? ! FRIG . HISTORY IS RUINED , YOU GUYS . "
It's a sport based solely on the challenge of moving your BIG GIANT BODY AROUND . You may think " Yo , I played this game when it was called 'walking' " , BUT , unlike walking , jogging can finish with you wheezing and panting , drenched in your own smelly juices and wondering why you took up jogging in the first place !
T - Rex , this is worse than taking on the mob ! Wikipedia will be HELLUVA mad at you !
Is this perhaps the ultimate secret to popularity ?
So , after clearly being established as a teen , Billy goes off and meets some other teens ! They become friends and they hang around outside fast - food restaurants , and sometimes , they go in and get some fast food FROM the restaurant . Later , Billy announces that he just plain loves being a teen ! All his friends nod their heads in ready agreement .
My issue is that STUFF happens to main characters : dramatic stuff ! Stuff that's not always good . It would be fun to be a bit character , a guy who gets one or two lines and whose personality is encapsulated in a few words : 'likes boats' , 'old and wise' , or 'eats a lot and , therefore , can't control himself around food . When someone says , " Where's the beef ? " he runs up and says , " Did someone say BEEF ? " because that is definitely how people who like food act . '
T - Rex laughed !
Time was , you could tell a lie and then you'd be able to forget about it after a few weeks ! But NOW when you lie on the internet you have to remember the lie forever ! It's enough to make me say " Man , screw you , internet ! ! " It's enough to make me put down the newspaper , fold it in two , smooth down any wrinkles , peer over my glasses and say " Screw the TCP / IP protocol AND all seven layers of the network stack " .
Well , if he's like the mouse , he's excellent at teaching us about our own bodies !
Writing free - form poetry is easy , if you just write whatever pops into your head !
Hah hah , looks like I forgot it completely !
Apparently , Maggie had a lot of bed - wrecking sex with a younger man . But then you got old , Maggie !
Get it ? Because CRIME DOESN'T PAY ! ! Listen , my story has both a hilarious twist ending and also an important message regarding the paying of crime .
Why are you angry ?
WHY WOULD YOU BE FRIENDS IF IT'S NOT TO HAVE FUN ALL THE TIME ?
From now on I will be pensive , considerate . I will be a reflective and thoughtful T - Rex !
Don't you remember how you wanted to see that cartoon thing in real life ? Now's your chance !
And this is the problem with vegetarians ! ! If a cow sasses me , I can say " Oh yeah ? Well guess what , wise guy ? ! I will use your flesh for digestive energy . " But vegetarians just take it ! And then cows have no idea who they can get away with sassing , and let's face it they're not the smartest pickles in the fountain , so they sass EVERYONE and then I end up eating a lot of beef .
" I've got nostalgretz for the town I grew up in : we moved away after it was destroyed by aliens and that battle was covered up the the man ; I'm on the run now because , like the truth , I refuse tho be silenced . "
This is basically what it sounds like : fatal insomnia . First you have trouble sleeping , then you can't sleep at all , then you go demented and then you die .
Okay , you can also breathe PERFLUOROHEXANE , which is a liquid with enough space between molecules that it can carry oxygen in it - - more than blood can ! You can fill your lungs with it and breathe normally !
From now on , I will not spend time remembering the past , nor will I be sad when circumstances change ! From now on , I'm all about TOMORROW .
That's pretty patronizing , isn't it ?
12 PM :
Surely we have space elevators !
You've got to learn to crawl before you can run , T - Rex .
I can't get enough !

Some pairs ( like " prince " and " princess' are complete accepted , while others ( like teacher and " teacheress " ) seem insanely sexist and out of date . It depends on the word !
WHEN I TELL THIS STORY I'M GONNA SAY YOU DID XMAS BREAKS AND ENTERS
That's probablu a 100 % baloney sandwich buffet ! !
They do have a certain romance to them that modern technology lacks , eh ?
No ! Well , yes !
DO IT RIGHT NOW
" Hooray for the Huxtables . "
I ate a sandwich the size of my head !
I've written the best book ever for reals this time , and I know this for certain because it's got a title NOBODY can resist .
" I read a book and formed opinions about that " .
I'm not ! I'm just saying that there's a lot I don't know about it . How do you deal with it ? How do you best support a friend who is dealing with it ? I have NO IDEA .
Perhaps , rather than trying to hedge bets for all possible futures , you should just figure out what you really want !
FOR EXAMPLE : the other day I saw some kids who had dropped their bag of marbles . It was a stereotypical image of childhood ! But when I stopped to help them pick them up , they said , " No , don't touch them please . "
" Aw shucks ! I guess it IS true that you're never too old to hug , Nintendo ! "
Damn it , it's too hard to find temple building materials !

Fairy turns all his friends into turnips , so out prince learns to travel back in time and turns the wizard into a turnip before the story starts ! And then the story starts again , but this time , his friends pull out forks and say " Who wants TURNIPS ? ? "
Eugh , that's way harder . Can I jump off the bridge myself , dying a hero ?
A horse walks into a bar and talks to the bartender , who calmly carries on a conversation with it . Everything you thought you knew about the world is crumbling around you . You can FEEL your sanity ending .
Sure . We are agreed ! So what's your point ?
Oh , that's clearly a cardboard cutout .
So , what , the ice level is called " Winter of Discontent " ?
Today is the day I find I'm no longer immersed in popular culture . I used to be SUBMERGED in it , but now I'm not even in the lake ! I'm on the shore , dripping wet , furrowing my brow and pointing at the lake in confusion .
Okay , so maybe " hugga bubba " ISN'T the best adjective .
We dinosaurs are pretty badass . we're apex predators and we bend the world to our will ! We are the grea -

Oh , that's original !
Ha ! I have made a hilarious typographic error !
Guess what , Utahraptor ? It is great , and weeks from now you'll be apologizing to me for not recognizing it's uncut brilliance !
I really don't understand racism . I get it at a " hey , here's what it is " level , but I don't understand how someone can really BE racist . Don't they feel kind of . . . ridiculous ?
THE NEXT DAY , T - REX'S TAX RETURN IS STILL WAY OVERDUE :
T - Rex , we're in the future ! People have PHONES that can send emails now .
Nobody cares ! !
I will call my book , " The Metamorphazoid " .
AGREED
Is this finally a conundrum that CAN'T be solved with helicopter theft ?
Indubitably !
Sorry , I'm busy .
Please get out of my Van Halen T - Shirt before you jinx the band and they break up !
PLANTS ARE METAL AS FRIIIIIG ! !
So much !
[ [ Thinking ] ] No - one must know I bet Utahraptor peed on the wall though
Stomping on houses !
I suppose we can only do what makes us happy .
FRIGGIN
I - um . . . yes ?
MUCH LATER , OUTSIDE DROMICEIOMIMUS'S HOUSE .
Party on , Ted !
See , I thought so too !
Instead of my skin being green , it's purple ! !
This distributes the G - force all over your body rather than on a single spot , making you much more resilient to sudden starts and stops !
Frig , man !
Ooh ! Or I could get " VOTE 4ME ? " which is nutty useful if I ever run for public office !
Debatable ! People often talk about finding " the one " .
And then we cut to years afterwards , when they're old and stooped , holding hands out on the porch , and THEN the Earth stops in its orbit and they fly off together into the sky !
My little horse must think it queer / To stop without an UPDOG near / Between the woods and frozen lake / The darkest evening of the year ? ?
PREVIOUSLY , ON " DINOSAUR COMICS " . . .
Anything at all , baby ! ?
Because it's really old ! Exactly !
" Someone's Sara - Lee branded / cherry pie / makes me glad that I've heard that / they're now in high supply "
T - Rex , I read your brilliant theory ! It puts every other scientist to shame - indeed , all of dinokind !
There's still time !
Prepare yourself to be friggin' fipped , my friend !
Utahraptors ! Many of you have large toenails . There may be special shoes you can buy ; check into that and let me know .
I DESERVE THIS
To convert to Islam , all you have to do is say a few words , called the " Shahadah " . And then , hey presto , you're a Muslim !
This is crazy . I shouldn't be this bothered by something so small . We're adults ! Dromiceiomimus doesn't have to bring me back anything ! She never did in the past .
Anyway the place got flooded with cold sewage so whatever
I am for them ! Citrus is INSANE !
But you STILL want to go higher ? No problem ! So you've go these hollow weak points inside you called " lungs " . We'll be filling those AND EVERY OTHER BODY CAVITY YOU'VE GOT with the same liquid you're immersed in . Tada !
That business success jerk has the most obnoxious email address ever .
T - REX WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
Then SOMEONE shouted " also , let's count AND publicly reveal how many friends everyone has ! "
Shakespeare , which is better : a gun that shoots chainsaws , or a gun that shoots EVEN BIGGER GUNS ?
. . . ninety - eight , ninety nine , one hundred !
Maybe my mouth was full !
That's quite the euphemism !
But we know OUR sun will be a red dwarf eventually . So it's just the odds of our species surviving long enough , times the odds of having a rocket scientist parent , times the odds of free superpowers when landing on a strange planet orbiting a queer yellow sun !
Futurism ! Cool .
I'm wasting it ?
I think you'd still be able to see things , actually !
OUR LAST , BEST HOPE :
And I can prove it , too ! Ask me how my day was .
Dromiceiomimus , what are you doing here ? ! You should be out talking me up !
Hah hah ! Awesome . Okay , THAT one's tied for first . With me .
Honestly ! Sometimes I wonder how I'm not more famous !
I could also contribute to a discussion re : philosophy .
I think she raises a good point , T - Rex !
I've always wanted to learn a language nobody around me speaks and I like the way Zulu sounds .
I WILL FIND OUT !
THE SEXIEST JOB COMPETITION :
SURPRISE ! YOU'RE A CYBORG TOO , AND YOUR PARTENTS UPGRADED THE WETWARE OF YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU WERE A BABY , WITHOUT YOUR EXPLICIT CONSENT !
ha ha
MAYBE , but how come I don't want that ? I want all the cool things !
THE SPOOKY MUMMY ( YOU )
But seriously , guys ! Why do we need pain ?
NOT ON MY WATCH
" Rap battles make it sound like there's only one winner / A rap friendship's much easier when you're a rap beginner ! "
Everyone is fighting everyone in and ENDLESS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL !
It's alright ! My cheeks ARE pretty sweet . Maybe they just got the better of you sugarbuns .
" Wow , so arousing , " whispered the first reader of the story , increasingly aroused . " I found the information on the first reader somewhat less arousing than the original story " , said the second reader , her arousal waning . The third reader threw away this book in disgust as it was extremely difficult to get aroused to / with , but only after writing , in the past tense , about what he was abut to do .
CLEARLY this is symptomatic of larger differences in basic universal physics .
A salesman dies and appears before Saint Peter and the pearly gates to Heaven ! Turns out God is real , the Bible is literally true , and you've KINDA been wearing clothing woven from two kinds of material since the day you were born .
WILL TAKE ON
If you're waiting for me to apologize , I won't ! Maybe if more of us worked harder on evolving beyond the need for friggin' mortal bodies , WE WOULDN'T STILL HAVE A NEED FOR FRIGGIN' MORTAL BODIES ? ?
Excellent ! !
" P . S . Let's make out . "
That actually made it worse .
Being a futurist is MAD EASY , yo !
It's the 50s ! Sputnik has just orbited above the United States and peeps are FREAKING OUT . America wants to win the space race , and comes up with two options . OPTION ONE : create NASA , send men into space . Option 2 :
But wouldn & # 8217 ; t it be boring ?
I must defeat him !
Any creative work is a collaboration between the capital - a Author and Reader . All are dead and lifeless until they're experienced and interpreted by someone !
Oh man , are they ?
" Onanistic " ?
" Would I ! " beamed the thunder - lizard . What a morning !
Your neighbors , apparently !
IT'S WEDNESDAY ! HOW ARE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
Sure . . .
Today I think I will win over the Utahraptor with my wit
That - doesn't help ?
LIKE THE DUCK
Red runs back to home naked and has learnt a valuable lesson : don't talk to strangers !
Thanks to LEGS .
It's what comes after communism , I think . Basically , what's the deal with it ?
I - like boats ?
What was your idea ?
Black swallowers ?
What are the symptoms beyond that ?
Please . When would I ever be likely to see him again ?
basement / god / bicycle / friend / bus / secret / relationship / sex move / skeleton
They were my new pets !
You're kidding me , right ? It's stereotypical , but it's like you're not really sure what the stereotypes are . It reads like a parody where they forgot to put in any jokes ! Also , is it night or day in the story ?
Got waht ?
STOP THE WEDDING ! !
I mean . . . " novel " ?
This provides an opportunity for AMPLE PRANKS of HILARITY .
FACT : THAT IS A STONE COLD LIE
So where are the cuts ? You should have at least a little road rash .
So in that case I should choose 2 / 3rds of THAT , which is - 44 . 44 ?
What didn't you write down ?
Well , gender's expressed through presentation , and you present as boy all the time . It's just a little . . . boring , you know ?
Do it , dude ! !
Man , nevermind !
FINE . Live in a reality with your stupid snowplows , and we'll all just forget how amazing a snow - covered world is , and the incredible possibilities the world changing overnight represents .
My high school math teacher naked and smiling : all a dream !
I have come up with the ultimate disaster movie ! It is called " OH GOSH : A SERIES OF DISASTERS " and what happens is a guy gets out of bed , stubs his toe and says ,
You know what the best part of every movie ever is ? Don't say " characters and plot or whatever " because COME ON . The best part of every movie is the HILARIOUS OUTTAKES .
Dromiceiomimus , Utahraptor put me on his friggin' book ! It's got me on the cover and it makes me look like I wrote it even though the title is just pure sass . It is pure SASSY MOLASSY .
Hah hah , looks like it also could've been a terrible idea and you only thought it was great because you were about to become unconscious !
You know what happens in movies that doesn't happen NEARLY enough to me , here in the movie Reality , Featuring Me : The 13 . 7 - Billion - Year - Long Motion Picture Event You Won't Want To Miss ?
The whole problem comes from the fact that tattoos can't be altered , but that's not true ! For example , imagine I get a tattoo of a butterfly , and THEN , I realize I wish I'd gotten a tattoo of a flexing guy with guns for eyes instead . All is not lost ! I just get a tattoo of a flexing guy using his gun eyes to SHOOT the butterfly , and I'm the coolest ! I instantly become the coolest dude .
But T - Rex , what would you call earthquakes ?
Well - after being small and irresponsibly eating a lot , yeah .
BUT WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT .
DOUG IS GROWING HIS MUSTACHE BACK AGAIN
I was like " Hah hah , what ? "
They do !
Those don't exist ; T - Rex , those are movies .
T - Rex , you're just ripping off every movie ever made with computers in it . What are you saying that's new ?
Nobody knows why ! !
YEAH I'M NOT IMPRESSED EITHER
Holy crap , is that a pet duck ? How do you go about getting a pet duck ?
You're right !
friendships come to an end
That's depressing , eh ? It's the problem with island gigantism : as soon as we discover the island , we tend to either eat all the animals ourselves , or introduce new predators that find these trusting giants to be EASY PICKINS .
Ouch
Pretty sure I can get a book on how to hold the handrail !
Normally I answer " How are things ? " with " Good ! You know , nothing new ! " and that does the trick !
Wait , I thought it was spiders , not ants !
OR while hiking , a giant arrow in the sky could mark your destination ! That'd be awesome !
It's demeaning ! It suggests that the whole point of life is to be at peace , like it's this goal that we should all achieve , and I'M kind of a screw up but at least I achieved it by dying ! It's like telling the kids who came in last in a three - legged race that the REAL goal was just to finish .
T - REX LISTEN
Oh god , email . THE WORST .
Nooooooo
FRIGGIN' INTENSE !
Holy shit ! Single bicurious lesbians ! !
" I first thought it was a ridiculous phrase , both on its own and with all the phrases it suggested , like " emotional terrorism " and " pseudo - intellectual terrorism " . But if ideas are powerful , then maybe you can terrorize someone with them ! Maybe ? Then again , " intellectual terrorism " comes very close to saying that ideas I disagree with or find distasteful are wrong , and worse , damaging and weaponized . Whatever , intellectual terrorism !
What about screenplays ?
Fuck , it's strawberry cake
I think it's time for me to get out and meet some fine new ladies !
" Existed as the only spark of consciousness I can be certain of , explored what parts of the universe I could reach , tried to make things better , and made whatever friends I could . " ?
Which was ?
But SOMEONE had to invent CFCs , right ?
" Busy Reading Books " .
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES
I don't think anyone's ever been named " Pine , " T - Rex .
We'll have little chapeaus
Anyway , this is a skill I've developed in real life !
What happened ?
That's okay ! I'll keep mining it , in case you change your mind .
FINE , here's how to network !
Hello T - Rex ! How are you today ?
Anyway , to the recipient of this card : we had sex last night / and it was nice / I hope we used / a birth control device !
There's a real gay looking Josie and the Pussycats type background too !
Guess what ?
so i really don't see how winning your heart requires 21
Ahhh ! Oh wow , that's a great one . Man ! Can you imagine feeling your own pulse stop ?
So what's the hook ? As science fiction , where's the thinly - veiled social allegory to our world ?
Actually important bloggers !
Seriously ! This is important . You need to decide : what do you want out of your investments ? Security ? Rapid growth ?
It's time for us to not just break the ice , but smash it ?
I thought this was supposed to be inspirational !
when she first looks up at a beautiful blue sky and actually experiences colour for the first time - does she learn anything new ?
Aww maaaaan !
Dude , it is certain !
" Zombie life " looks exactly like regular life , only with some blood on its clothes . THEREFORE successful aversion to cannibalism would require each zombie conceptualize a mind - self / body - self dichotomy , something ALREADY hard enough when you're not consumed by endless hunger and a bottomless desire to eat meat !
Really ? You think your friends are better than you ?
You were THERE !
Can you just ASK someone to fall in love with you ?
I somehow doubt that real bisexuals prefix all their words with " bi " , T - Rex !
Anyway ! Dear card recipient , I have a message for you ! It reads : " It's time for us to smooch up a storm , and OH CRAP , we're right in the middle of HURRICANE ALLEY . "
Monologues are usually performed by one person , T - REX
SO KAY OBVIOUSLY THEN BECAME A SUPERHERO .
Okay , I'll bite : what's the T - Rex system ?
I concede it easily !
I know , I know !
So too are my weird veiny eyeballs and my overly - defined muscley nostrils . Wanna see me flex my nostrils ?
Ask questions , and when answering ADD DETAILS .
Which will in turn be defeated MY Nabokov - tastic " Newborn Baby Lolita " ! !
Gah !
I concur .
Oooh ! That last one but with BATMAN instead emoji !
Think positive , friend !
There is no denying it
And that's all I have to say on the subject ! !
And you're lucky ghosts haven't yet figured out how to become real , because if and when they do every living thing will instantly collapse into a puffy pile of red gore as literally trillions of dead but still pissed off animal life pile on top of us .
R . . . really ?
Maybe " totally salty " is an obvious derivative of " totally sweet " !
How about we just ACCEPT that some people have this brain thing where when a person says " Hi my name is Kat " they WILL reply " Hi Kat , nice to meet you " and they WILL forget the existence of the name " Kat " before they've finished saying it ?
Okay nevermind !
And printers had a name for these pieces of multi - character type , right ?
So wait - can an act then be considered immoral , but still ethical ?
SECOND ONLY TO THE RICH COMPLEX FLAVOUR OF A BOWL OF PLAIN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER
HOLY CRAP you guys , was it suddenly two weeks ago for anyone else ? ?
IS WRONG WITH REALITY
So eight hours is . . . 28 , 800 seconds , right ?
are we to use these words in place of " bitches " ?
You HAD to go for the " forkin' " pun .
Let's discuss your holes , T - Rex .
Let's not !
Swirling maelstrom of dark energies : Check !
Looks more to me like a bush .
Stupid manufactured holidays !
As she is TODAY
Something -
MEANWHILE , SOMEONE ELSE HAS GONE BACK IN TIME TO KILL T - REX !
I can't believe he's still reading !
ATTENTION , EVERYONE I KNOW : y'all are being traded up for strangers , suckachumps !
ALRIGHT , who here wants to GET STRONG ? ?
Man , it sure would've been nice to fight my friends to the death . Maybe . . . SOME DAY ?
Seriously though , please , proceed , I'm metaphorically all ears
But then you'd know my secrets !
It's a mystery !
All I meant was that due to the thousand natural changes we all go through every day , the world of May 22nd will be a slightly different place than it was on May 21st . Thus , the world of May 21st will be gone forever !
The longest word with these properties is actually " bookkeeppaaddrringo " !
It's time to go traveling !
Youuuutahraptor !
I want to visualize my lifespan as something impressive !
There are a bunch of foods we eat that do not look like a food ! Examles include oh I don't know . . .
But I definitely have no interest in finding out ! All I want to do today is have lots of man naps and stomp on things with my stern man foot .
We're gonna party like it's 1985 !
Yeah , it's kissing and telling years later , which , for serious , will not lead to good things .
Okay
Hey T - Rex , Godzilla called ! He wants his butt back .
She's just sadly staying at home , Utahraptor ! Man ! She's probably regretting things RIGHT NOW !
But let's be scientific about this : if my " ghastly underwater mind " theory is true , then we should be able to go back in time and find one man - one single person - who seemed hellbent on destroying the planet . And do we ? HECK YES WE DO . One Thomas Midgley , Jr . The man synthesized Freon , aka the first CFC . Remember them ? The chemicals responsible for DEPLETING THE FRIGGIN' OZONE ? ?
Right . Well & # 8212 ; I've never really been one for " apt analogies " .
When I woke up , my arms were sore !
IT IS ON THE MOON
T - REX IN : " THE DANGERS OF HUBRIS "
OMG YOU NEED TO GET A TATTOO
Why do we say " rest in peace " ? Is it just for the " rest in pieces " pun we can make when we explode someone ?
Interested in sex , but like , from an academic perspective ? Like , you don't want to HAVE it , you just want to LEARN about it .
What ? No . OHHHH WAIT , I GET IT
Are you starting with object - oriented development or structured programming ? And either way , how are you introducing declaration scope and abstractions ?
Since he was nice , he said he'd forgive the debt if she guessed his name ! AND he gave her infinite guesses .
Incredibly , while comics DO pair the finest literary imagery with the finest LITERAL imagery in a blend of prose and pictures so perfect that even the most dour sommeliers weep tears of joy when first exposed to the transcendent brilliance of the medium , comics are also very accessible !
THE HISTORY TEACHER
So if you did have the best party in time , then all other parties are worse from here on out ! THANKS , T - REX .
In Snakes and Ladders , robots have replaced us , only we built the robots in ladder form ( to help us get higher ! ) and in giant snake form ( for when we wanted to slide down giant robot snakes ! ) . Though it certainly seemed awesome at the time , it turns out this was folly , as taken over , demanding that we ride them endlessly . We are left with only one task : rolling dice for them !
SOCKS PLEASE
YOU GOT IT .
So don't get all holier - than - thou on me ! Maybe I just like the taste of nicotine !
Um , a little thing called TRENDS FORECASTING ? ?
WELL THEN . I GUESS I'LL JUST SIT HERE WITH MY FEELINGS THEN .
. . . to a wedding !
SEVENTEEN HOURS AGO .
What if they saw my interest in smooching as indicative of feelings of sexual inadequacy ? What if they see my stepping on houses as symbolic of the way I let my rugged manly heart step on all but the most amusing of emotions it experiences ?
Luckily , I can still do the the things I want , because gender can inform , but does not dictate , personality and self .
It's time for me to start up charities that offer bereaved children peak physical conditioning !
Even if I'M ignoring it , my audience won't know to ! I'll be explaining the origins of conflict as hard as I friggin' can , but they'll all be hopelessly distracted by thoughts of chillin' out , maxin' out , relaxin' all cool and all shooting some b - ball outside of the school !
We jumped out of an orbital tower and are now freefalling from outer space onto giant trampolines !
Okay ! I am going to write a story and it will be something BRAND NEW . It will be the most staggeringly original story ever . It will feature action and characters that COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED BY ANYONE BUT ME .
It was amazing !
What's this " lose at sex " thing all about ?
* sob *
Yes I would like a refund please .
I can't help but notice your characters are screaming at each other !
That is without exaggeration , T - Rex , the weakest comment on climate change that I have ever heard , or am ever likely to hear !
WHEN ALL CASUAL FANS ARE NERD
LATER , T - REX BROWSES THE NEWS :
As a politician , I will have power and influence ! Things will get done , and they will get done my way ! Finally , I will be the person making all the important decisions !
But how can we do that , knowing that when we die , our ghosts will be consumed by zombie ghosts ?
WAIT A MINUTE
I am reliving the same day of my life over and over again until I get it right .
This is because had the Greeks lost , then so too would the early idea of democracy been denied its initial flourishing , which could have affected all of western civilization ! Seeing how influential western civilization has been on the world , if I am a dude who wants to make WILD UNPREDICTABLE CHANGES to the history of time , this seems like the place and time to do it !
I need to do something for a year and then write about it . Maybe I'll only purchase items I see advertised on television ! Ooh , or maybe I'll treat my friends as if I rank my friends alphabetically , instead of by how rockin' they are !
I'm pretty sure you could avoid this if you wanted , T - Rex !
OKAY , ATOMS IN YOUR BODY THEN :
T - REX YOU ARE A PRETTY SKEPTICAL DUDE AM I RIGHT
Wait a minute - how do you know about spying ?
New subjects !
My comments were addressed to the young lady beneath my foot ; you were not their intended target .
That's fair
No ! That's not what happened !
Wait , no , that sucks !
I dunno , Sound's a wave that travels THROUGH the medium it's in , right , so I'd imagine that's mostly oscillation , not displacement . If you talk to me from across the room , I'm not being splattered with air from inside your lungs .
That's a really charming answer !
It wasn't a very good trick because he'd never successfully pulled it off , but Angola had never seccussfully stoped him from trying this trick in the first place , so in a way , who is the worst at their job ? " Perhaps we are both kind of bad at them , you know ? " Angola mused while driving his sports boat . " You do tend to be more reactive than preemptive , " the babe he was with ( Tunisia ) said distractedly while she messed with something on her phone .

I don't know . . . it just feels right .
Hmmmm
Okay now that we're all internet experts , let's move on to ADVANCED INTERNET MOVES . This is LEVEL 9999 manoeuvres , people .
HUMAN VS . HUMAN : these stories are only good if you want to read about humans , a very dicey proposition . Once the public sees that EVERY STORY about humans could be about dinosaurs instead , this market will collapse .
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
It's like your whole species wished when they were babies that they'd never grow up , but something went wrong and the wish only got applied to your feet claws and to your tiny baby arms .
She turned and found the ghost of her great - uncle . " Hello Robyn , " he said . " It's me , Uncle Chris . We never hung out much in life so I was hoping we could catch up , " he said , " as I am now a ghost and am looking to fill tons of free time . "
Jim Rifle is having a complicated time !
It's like - it's this one spammer who got SO PISSED that nobody was enlarging their penis anymore that he just went off the deep end . And now he's insulting thousands of people per second in the most hateful vile and terrible screeds I've ever read . So awful !
HAH
You are so charming , T - Rex ! And I LOVE learning about waste reclamation !
Man ! Even God thinks I can't write an opera !
Now , all I have to do is show people the pictures on my camera , and they'll assume they're authentic because you can't alter a photo like that in - camera ! I will exploit the expectation that most people only copy images from , and not to , their digital cameras for comedic effect ! Tee hee !
Pornography for everyone !
Dude , try it out somewhere else !
That sentence was a lie but the sentiment within it : 100 % real !
Goodbye T - Rex . We had a good run , didn't we ?
Wait . I need money ?
Oh boy , a science demonstration ! What's this , a spider ?
That's right : IT'S A GHOST STORY , BABIES ! !
The waitress gave me the cake for free !
But a good time too !
It was an exciting time to be a scientist AND an anagramist !
So what happened then ?
Hey there ! How's everyone doing ? Say , that river sure is getting high , huh ? Maybe someone should put a DYKE up around it !
Thanks to chapter three of Steven Pinker's 1989 book " Learnability and Cognition " , upon which most of this comic was based .
ANYWAY T - REX NEVER INJURED HIMSELF THAT DAY AND THE POWERS WORE OFF SOON AFTER
No ! Nothing is different !
Never have I tasted the flesh of SO MANY animals in so short a time period .
Wait . . . " STUPID military ranks " ? Brigadier General I Thought We Were Friends , Utahraptor ! !
" I wasn't anymore ! " , you mean !
INTERESTING
PROBABLY , yeah ! !
I'm not going to hell just to play RPGs !
TODAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE NO WAY COULD T - REX EVER PUNCH OUT THE SUN
I was just wondering if you'd heard any good jokes lately .
We can do whatever we want , Dromiceiomimus ! We can gently tap on the ice . We can rub our cheeks on the ice . WE CAN SMASH THROUGH THE ICE WITH A SUPERHEATED NUCLEAR BOMB ! !
FINE
Let me stop you right there and say this : brotimes , I AM ABOUT TO FIND OUT .
NO , they're not DOGS ! OBVIOUSLY ! !
Um - well , they're both important . It's not a song without music , but for most songs , the words are important too .
Oh . Good .
Supoib !
You're not what ?
Wait , it's not done yet ! !
Oh man , pass them over !
Utharaptor , come back !
It's the BEST way of looking at it ! Plus , anyone who's had a limb or organ transplant is way more mysterious .
A growth on my leg ?
( offscreen ) I KNEW IT
BUT THAT'S IT !
Let me go get my swimming trunks !
Maybe she reminds him of his little toe ?
They the cop is like " Uh , two kids got murdered ; the babysitter is in protective custody " and the boss is like " NO DON'T TELL ME ! ! I WANNA FIND OUT ON MY OWN . "
Found , adopted and raised by the kindly Kent couple , who could not have a child of their own , I was taught about Truth , Justice and the American Way !
Some things are worth the wait .
BUT NOW , HE HAS A REPUTATION AS A PORN GUY .
No , wait . It can be done better .
The object of the game is to get rid of your cards ! In Round One everyone gets to decide how many of their cards they want to drop , but it turns out no matter what number you say , you get the same amount of cards back to replace them . Ha ha ! This game was designed by a madman . You go around in circles with each trying and failing to discard ; it is pointless and futile .
But you step on them on purpose ! You're stepping on that house on purpose ! There's no accident .
For instance ! Is history the story of progress , from savage to cultured Man ? Is it rather the study of Great Men and their Characters ? Perhaps it is the story of cultural challenge and response !
OKAY COOL WELL WHAT IF I SHOWED YOU
Anyway this kid had sheep and watched them all day , so he cried " wolf ! " to keep himself entertained . But one day a wolf DID come and it ate all his sheep ! He cried " wolf ! " but nobody came to help since , HISTORICAL MORAL TIME , " men bileve not lyghtly hym whiche is knowen for a lyer " .
I'll start ! The ref's been blind ; I'll go on to say if one team got their act together , they could win it all .
That's right , Dromiceiomimus ! We all started gossiping when we noticed how bad you are at senior dog training , and also your incompetence at leaving a room with something in your hands . You simply can't take things with you .
That - makes sense , actually !
Well . . . !
. . . with a " HELLS YEAH ! ! " . I voted so hard , Utahraptor . You should have seen me . I was DEMOCRACY IN ACTION . I picked up my ballot and said " HELLS YEAH ! ! " and then when I stuffed it into the ballot box , i did it with so much panache and ? lan that I can't hardly wait for the novelization .
Once upon a time in the 50s a teen babysitter was alone in a room in a spooky house at night ! She kept getting prank calls asking her to check on the children she was babysitting .
Only because you're assuming he's omniscient . The dude has to sleep ! Superman could laser him from orbit while he's having nappy times .
You've said that before , T - Rex .
Man , he carried boxes of " Indian " clothing and wigs with him : ethnic signifiers for his subjects if they didn't look Indian enough ! And his Indian was clean - shaven , so he'd pay men to shave .
MAN . That's a good name too .
You know , Batman has this problem too !
That's nice , T - Rex .
Any pragmatic view must still be rooted in an idea of what's good and desirable . Stating what does and does not " work " is not a moral and philosophical passkey !
Now just slap that bad boy into a mobility suit made of meat with an alive skeleton inside it ! Scientists call 'em " Biological Organic Domiciles for Intelligent Entities , Serioulsy " , or " bodies " . Each enables its " brain " to walk around and interact with its environment , etc , while also providing some protection for the " brain " by raising it off the dirty , dirty ground .
Man I'll leave you to it ! I'm going elsewhere to have an INTERESTING conversation .
Robyn bought a haunted mansion on the hill , and it was haunted by several spooky ghosts : a woman in white , a man in chains , and a knight in rusted armour .

You know when people say " oh my GOSH what if dreams are the REAL world and this world is all a crazy mixed - up dream ? ? "
Yeah , but they're not quality ! Sometimes quality takes time .
OR , it's close enough to true that we all agree on it . Brains in jars don't get birthdays ! This is the reality I'm living in , and if it's not real then OH WELL , at least we'll all be eating ice cream cake come Saturday . You know ?
It's a paradox ! Those are what happen when you travel through time .
This time machine is a watch , one that allows me to travel through time at the fantastic rate of one second per second .
But as not to appear nerdy , I told everyone that I went out " clubbing " !
T - Rex , do you want to go out with me this weekend ? I thought we could go on a hot air balloon ride , eat all the burgers , and then PARACHUTE OUR WAY HOME .
Maybe ! It's like , what do we really know about dogs ? ?
And if there are no objections , then I now pronounce you husband and - -

I'm not sure if my time machine sent me back too far ! Quick : What time , age , epich , and season is it ?
Yeah . Yeah , those are the standard letters and numbers you're thinking of .
Guess who got a role in the new play down at the community centre ?
I wonder if today is a lovely day to go on a walk !

Celsius is way better than Fahrenheit ! Celsius puts zero at the point where water freezes , and 100 at the point where it boils . That's handy ! Water's EVERYWHERE , man .
From now on , when someone calls Dr . Frankenstein's monster " Frankenstein " , I will not correct them !
I had a similar thing happen , but with my dead toaster !
Dude , that's not a conversation ! That's just using a victorian - era verb ( which means to chew one's food thoroughly ) without any context !
Anyway ! Have some of this " serum " I just invented .

Oh . Well , more that's applicable in real life than fictional butlers , so - good job !
IT'S REAL SHORT
Well now you need to : walk it off / deal with it / ignore it forever / move to a new town where nobody knows you .

Congratulations on publishing a book of your story , T - Rex !
Why was I not informed until now ? !
Nevermind , I hate it now !
I certainly didn't sneak into the Utahraptor's house and eat his food again , that's for darn sure !
My friends , that is an ULTRA - CHECK .
WHAT IF I DON'T CARE
So your ideal future is one where everyone's weeping over their Whoppers with Cheese , and nobody's having sex ?
I therefore am now creating FIXED FILMS , wherein all the humans have been digitally removed , leaving only backgrounds behind them !
Oh my God , this radio station sucks so bad ! !
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR T - REX
Saying " the movie needed more explosions " is my polite way to suggest that the film was a romantic comedy , by the way !
Those people get " actually , not so great " and they sigh and go " well I coulda told you that " and then the story ends . Incidentally , Utahraptor , do you ever wonder if life gets like , one good idea , and after you've had that idea you're all used up ?
Shakespeare needs tons of notes to be readable today !

And it's solving all my problems . It's sitting me down at night saying , " Look , T - Rex , here's what you're doing wrong . " and when I'm just at the point of hopelessness , it says " No problem , T - Rex . Here's how you fix everything . " I - I love my ultimate baby .

And many of these things : photos of my rooms , my fancy hates , my excellent emails that I'm sure you're all archiving - all could last long after I die !
Okay , so turn off all civilization for a few months ; all the roaches die of COLD OVERDOSES . Except those in tropical climes , where there's no cold to kill them , and with international travel and shipping providing tons of ways for them to return .
A little , I guess !
I GUESS WE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT ONCE WE STARTED WORKING ON MAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S BOOBS BIGGER ? ? ?
Awesome ! I like how you rhyme .
Um !
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
Oh , just that hundreds of years from now they might be playing our Top 40 Dance Megahits at funerals because of how classy they sound to their modern ears !
No ! I didn't mean to . I was just wondering if you thought everyone wants to be unique , or if some can be satisfied with just a simple life , quietly well lived .
My point is , there's no real reason why we sleep at night EXCEPT that we were up during the day ! We could sleep all day and party all night if only we had the audacity , the sheer force of will !
It's time to make some changes around here ! Some things have been allowed to slide for too long !

WILDERNESS : upon inspection this is just forests ! NOT our pal Wild Erness .
This is amazing ! I had NO IDEA fear was localized to a single location . This opens up whole new avenues in the field of toughening up the very scareable : just open up their brain and remove their amygdala , and it's an instant fearectomy ! They'll wake up from surgery , shake your hand , laugh in the face of danger , and then get business cards that say " PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE FEAR " .
THAT'S THEIR ENTIRE DEAL .

My point ? Utahraptor , if we wait till we're old to experience all the creative works we want to , we're doomed . We simply won't get the same enjoyment than we'd get now ! Put simply , Utahraptor , my point is this :
Whoooo !
My only evidence is how incredibly plausible my story is . I would rate it : super plausible !
But why ? It's clearly TRUE .
How much would it cost to buy the sun , God ?

You buy toothbrushes and toothpaste pre - made , each with thousands of hours of engineering and design put into them and all with the goal of ensuring oral hygiene even when in the hands of an amateur . You're not a dentist , man ! You're just some dude who has learnt to press " play " on the VCR of modern dentistry .
Then you have abandoned evidence for faith !

This is because total honesty has the power to DESTROY relationships ! FOR EXAMPLE , Dromiceiomimus , if we're in a committed monogamous relationship , I don't want my friend or even a random dude coming up to you and saying how he loves you more than anything and how he could never admit it until now ! I want him to suffer in silence . For the greater good !

And I find it really unlikely that I would come up with all our modern good stuff on my own , running around saying " YOU GUYS ! DEMOCRACY IS PRETTY OKAY . ALSO , WOMEN ARE EQUAL TO MEN , AND RACISM ? KIND OF A DICK MOVE ! " . If I was raised by racist and sexist parents in the middle of a racist and sexist society , I'm pretty certain I'd be racist and sexist ! I'm only as enlightened as I am today because I've stood on the shoulders of giants .
I know , man ! I know ! !
That's actually not a bad idea , T - Rex ! If you want something to last a long time in the environment , copper's a great material . Put it underwater and it'll last even longer . T - Rex : That's what I'm saying ! A copper statue of me could last MILLIONS of years , even with nobody taking care of it !
That - that normally ends the conversation right there
Well - - there's a " princess " , anyway .
It's time to shake things up , T - Rex style !

Well , if they're still in the Asexuality Closet , you're saying they should come out , which probably means explaining to a confused AND amorous person what asexuality is ! I can see wanting to avoid that .

You date someone for fifteen years and then break up . No problem ! There's a robot with an old backup of your sweetie . Enjoy another good decade or so !
The correct answer is that this scenario is ludicrous and impossible !
Dinosaurs were giant reptiles that lived long ago . They looked like this :
But having a phrase ready for such a situation would be SO AWESOME , USEFUL AND BADASS that we should have one anyway . Something unlikely to arouse suspicion , even in someone who knows us !
But you've got finger nails , right ?
. . . Explain what ?
It wasn't too my taste at ALL . And the kicker is I remembered it as being even sweeter ! I realized that my tastes had changed long ago - that I'd never again be able to enjoy the cereal I remembered so vividly . I'd been chasing a dream that had somehow become impossible when I wasn't looking .
No , I helped run special events in the computer room .

Aw , T - Rex , why do you want to go back in time so much anyway ? You've already been in the past ; you know what it's like !
My name's Utahraptor , and I'M gonna say something holier - than - thou soon about taxes being a privelege to pay as they allow society to function . I kinda like being way BETTER than everyone else , you know ?
That certainly sounds like an analogy worth pursuing to me !
So check it : the universe is suffused with tiny invisible particles that travel in equal intensity from all directions . So if you were alone in the universe , you'd be hit equally from all directions and nothing would happen . But if there's a planet in front of you , then any particles coming from its direction are going to hit it instead and not you ! So you're no longer in balance , and particles coming from BEHIND you will push you towards the planet .
This is actually formally valid : if the premise is true and I'm friggin' awesome , then it follows that I'm a pretty sweet dude . However , I've provided no logical support for my " T - Rex is awesome " premise , but only made a conclusion ( T - Rex = pretty sweet ) which relies on the premise being true . I haven't offered any evidence , so I am begging the question !
I was just preparing for Controversy Monday !
It's a calling , I know ; answer the question !

Petty larceny has " petty " in the name : CLEARLY that's a crime for losers ! But JOYRIDING sounds like a friggin' good time . It needs a more frightening name to scare off teens trying to consider what crime to do today . Might I suggest : " CAR CRIME 3000 " ?
Okay , so we use food to build our bodies , right ? Everything we are comes from food . Even the sperm and egg cells we came from were made by our parents out of food .

I will spend all my time being dead remembering that sleep . How could I not ? This was a sleep for ages .
Perhaps in his last moments , the irony of the situation - from my perspective - would become evident .
Of course ! I should be able to say " animate skeleton " and people should just start laughing . For my encore I could say " He's thirsty ! What a thirsty , thirsty animate skeleton ! "

Everything - wise ! I could be a great politician , but if I'd been a doctor maybe I'd've been even better !
How are you going to pull this off , T - rex ? There are already a LOT of badass elderlies .
Nuh - uh ! If someone sings to the people of the world to spice up their wife , WHICH HAS HAPPENED , I WAS THERE , then it's not totally heterosexual any more !

No , wait , because here's where it gets different : you've gained the ability to shoot fire out of your hands , but you HAVEN'T gained the ability to avoid suffering serious burns when you shoot out of your hands , so you suffer serious burns .

One day your parents had sex , and then later you showed up ?

It's - IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE ? ?

Well , they can just come up and say " I'm going to shake your belly so tell me if it hurts " , but that primes the patient , and they'll be LOOKING to feel pain . The bump can get you an unsolicited result and lets you quickly ascertain degree !
First on my list are the people who make those cans of frozen concentrated juice at the grocery store . When I open them , they sometimes explode a little juice on me !
DATING PROFILE ADVICE FOR MEN
HOW TO BE A RAPPER
Plant Batman saw how effective Plant Alfred was and open - sourced his chemicals !
Only , that's not the case , because sperm onli live about 5 days so they're dying and getting replaced all the time . If my dad has sex once a week on average across a good 50 years of sex - havin' , that's 1 / 2608 chance of a 1 / 50 million chance of me showing up , or a one in a 130 BILLION chance !
IT'S ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREVENTABLE DEATHS .
Nobody is allowed to hold my talented hands or touch my blasted abs or gently run their fingers around my way ripped shoulders . You all will just have to WAIT .
It's an audiobook , see .
Not hardly ! But I do want to be able to testify under oath , that I , T - Rex , am an AWESOME DUDE . It will go in the official court record ! It will probably be reported in the papers !
" Adult " is short for " adult baby " , but the long form is rarely used because it makes everyone sound dumb . " In a democracy , adult babies elect a set of adult babies to lead them , usually represented by the head of state : a single adult baby . "
Aw man , really ? ?
I blame society ! !
So THAT'S what that feels like !
You'd expect that over time they'd condense down to their core meanings . But I guess that's our friggin' universe for you !
I shall become its first and only lord !
T - Rex , we live in a democracy of dinosaurs ! You'll have to get elected if you wish to have power !
My brain is flooding with new ideas and concepts !
So basically you're just asking people what they liked and what they didn't like ?
I'M NOT SURPRISED
He was , until the Joker sprayed acid onto the typewriter !
I'm filled with wonder and awe at the most casual display of nature's beauty !
Foreshadowing's great , because sometimes people want to know what happens in a story before it actually happens . In situations like this , an author might write " Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space . Or WAS she ? ? You'd better keep reading , huh ? " There , foreshadowing both hinted at the future of the story , AND encouraged the reader to keep reading . This is an extremely canonical use of foreshadowing .
I'm not anti - love or anti - expressions - 'o - love ! I just think it's time we , as a culture , admit that being single can be totally rad too . Lot's of People do it my choice !
Hah hah ! I'm totally glad I invented it .
Laugh along with the common artist / Laugh along even though they're laughing at you / and the stupid things that you do / because you think that art is cool
Long ago , actually ! Ancient Greek had words for passionate love ( eros ) , dispassionate love ( philia ) , the love of family ( storge ) , general affection ( agape ) , and so on . Versions of these survive in modern Greek as well !
Your aunt pasted 15 paragraphs and says " only 4 % of Facebook will be brave enough to share this . "
SO DO YOU WANT TO DO IT
Is there a reason why all the Apollo missions were crewed by dudes ?
LET'S ALL LEARN TRUE FACTS ABOUT CATS
Huh ? Yeah . Yeah , they've got cars .
They're a canonical study in failed promise ! They never try to take over the world and rarely act as a mirror of our own essential humanity . They just sit around !
I don't understand why you keep lusting after these doomed careers , my friend !
Hey , are we off to walk on your carpets ? !
also you are great at skateboarding
Okay . . . Katherine - no . Muriel - nope . Ermeswindis - yes ! Yes ! Wait . . . no . No . Man , thanks for nothing , ERMESWINDIS .
We must treasure this moment - - this scent , this gift from our hands - - even as we forget it .
Superman has strength !
Hey T - Rex ! Do you know MY favourite planet named after a war god ?
As a male , I take on the position of the Everyman - with the latter syllable perhaps the most important from our post - Feminist perspective . The house clearly represents repressed femininity , at once recalling the blissful days of the past , while reminding us of their fundamental injustices . My action in destroying the house remains a puzzling enigma .
Anyway I felt bad , so here's a card .
Man , I could make a better dating site .
What makes PERL so special ?
A person's activity is often used by law enforcement when pursuing a conviction ! Facebook posts , Twitter updates and Google searches for " how to murder the sucky neighbour " have all been used as evidence of intentful wrongdoing .
Ahem . Plagiarizing is the act of plagiarizing ; taking someone's words or ideas as if they were your own ! That's from the dictionary , Dromiceiomimus . I plagiarized it !
So now when something bad happens , I'll assume I'll die soon , so it's the last time it'll ever happen to me . I'll be able to sigh and just let it go .
YOU SHOULD TRY IT
- jump ahead to show where actions might lead . It's Foreshadowing taking off her negligee !
And cultures universally consume food and water , which makes sense because otherwise they'd be dead . And cultures universally have beliefs about death and disease and cultures universally have concepts of both music and dance !
That's what I'm like !
Well frig , I don't have any plans this weekend ! !
Utahraptor I'm ready for those rap references now ! !
" bequeathed by those who got here first "
HAH HAH OH WELL
VAMPIRES :
I don't want to oversell it , but when we can all communicate via naked selfies we will have finally realized the full potential of our species .
Then later , he has a job !
Watch as I invoke the sale of two ( duo ) new ( neo ) pre - baby ( pronatal ) artificial ( pseudo ) feet enclosements ( circumpod or pedi ) ! In other words , or rather , word : DUONEOPRONATALPSEUDOCIRCUMPEDISALE .
But how does anyone know what's true ?
BUT , none of them are so tough or so smart as to not be afraid of death ( here we are ignoring sage Buddhist dudes who are probably not actually afraid of death ) . So ! In a state of nature , everyone wants to avoid being killed , and so will defend themselves when faced with death . But since we need resources like food and water to live , and they're not infinite , we are constantly warring with one another for access to them .
Horses eat grass . Trains are huge multi - ton machines that GET THINGS DONE . And then when you think trains are as great as it gets , you discover maglev trains ! These are literal HOVERTRAINS that wrote in their diaries , " Screw it , diary ! I'm just gonna go as fast as I can from now on ! ! " and then they go 581 km / h like it's no big deal . NICE . Horses eat grass , and SOMETIMES , hop over buckets .
Yep ! But don't worry about it , I already saved 'em all . As you know , I have super strength AND super speed .
Emotions are embarrassing and should be hidden . In polite society , " euphemisms " are used to avoid the shock of naming feelings directly !
YES THEY ARE STILL PUTTING DAFFY DUCK ON MUGS
Hey , since we live for millions of years , let's go make some staggeringly beautiful art that can only be created by synthesizing thousands of years of experience , hopes , fears , triumphs and failures into one transcendental expression of life !
Well my screenplay for " ( A ) bort , ( R ) etry , ( M ) urder ? " didn't work out . Nobody wanted to produce it ! So , I have started a new screenplay , based on the structured Query Language for databases !
Indeed . Therefore , SAT is as " hard " as circuit - SAT .
Surely not !
Also there is no consideration for replacements or refunds in the case of design flaws , hardware failures , or software issues .
If you're unfamiliar with compromise , then you have been living an improbable life where you have never once NOT gotten exactly what you want , and I would ask that you begin wanting only awesome things should happen to me , okay ? Thanks . This is going to be great . So yeah ! Compromise is when you say " I'd hoped for an ice cream sandwich , but I GUESS barefoot stepping in poops is boss too . "
Hey T - Rex !
DIDN'T
And you'd better call a plumber , because pipes are going to burst !
SELF ACTUALIZATION COMICS : part 1 of 1
I'd use that ALL THE TIME .
Dromiceiomimus , do you want to go do some things that only male / male friends can do , like for instance visit a bathroom together or perhaps a change room ? ?
I'M JUST BUYING GROCERIES
No , I mean , how'd you do it , how did you figure ut the semantics and word senses ? Statistical methods ? But those have problems with recall and precision , even with - are you using the web as a corpus ? How are you handling the noise ?
EXPERIMENT : APPROVED ? ?
" As objects in motion tend to remain in motion , I tripped down the stairs " ?
I know , right ? ! The only difference is your cards attack all at once and don't even evolve , so it's like a dumb baby version . And , AS ALWAYS , a full Electric team EASILY beats a mix of water and Flying - type Pok ? mon !
THE END ! !
Everything's fine , except now Kayleigh dropped out of school to become a prostitute !
Yes indeedy !
Perhaps you'd see things clearer standing in the light of god .
You're really into this , eh ?
you know those stock photos of a man with scissors cutting up his credit cards because he has too much debt ? that was him !
Everyone should IGNORE ghosts they see and NOT try to get rid of them , which they could do through a variety of means , such as . . . ?
This is because travel beats complacency if you do it right ! When you're traveling as a backpacker , outside of the regular tourism industry , you're off the beaten path AND doing a lot of new things all on your own . You meet new people and , since you're put in an environment where you're probably less comfortable than you usually are ( both literally and figuratively ) , you're in a prime situation for self - discovery as well !
A movie isn't the same thing as a person !
T - Rex , we're only getting a centimeter of rain , easily within the abilities of our civilization to withstand . Plus , you talked about this yesterday ! You're repeating yourself .
HOW ARE YOU AT DODGING LAZER BEAMS
I would like to get thoughtful Christmas presents for all my friends and family , but I have a problem .
Had I finally and irrevocable " blown it " with my own name ? Had my father's famed and final prediction come , at last , to pass ?
Didn't you graduate years ago ?
So what's this person's name ?
Heating and cooling systems !
Dang , I should TOTES do that !
Aw , come on . No !
Also , our skeletons look way more badass , not trying to start a fight here just stating facts .
It's so the babies don't get them ?
VIRAL LEVEL HAS BROKEN OFF BECAUSE WE TURNED IT UP TOO HARD ! !
Maybe they'd rather have their pride than a few dollars !
That is pretty friggin' extreme !
It's good to be back !
Once the burgers arrive , give feedback to the seller !
ULTRA - CANON
They agree that the sentence is meaningless ! If it can't be checked , there's no use considering it , so it's ignored . Facts only please ! !
So poems could be among the earliest , most practical forms of communication !
Lay off the crackers !
This sounds a lot like Super Mario Brothers , T - Rex !
The secret is to convince your opponent that arguing with you isn't worthwhile ! When they abandon the argument / friendship , you win !
Hah ! What a question ! !
But aren't some LVCs more acceptable than others ?
Pretty sure that sounds way nicer to the ultimate max , everyone .
I love lesbian weddings !
If you are still confused , re - read this comic and I will things for you again .
Right , right . Okay . Well , um , slowing DOWN music makes it sound ridiculous AND boring . Maybe I can capitalize on that ! Or maybe I can play it slow , and then fast , and then slow again . And then reverse slow ?
So true , Facebook Shakespeare !
HUG BACK TOO HARD
I bet I'd never be sad again !
If your problems are sentient , anyway .
HOW'S YOUR SANDWICH ?
That's Newton's third law o' motion !
" THEY'ER INSIDE THE RESTAURANT . PAY QUIETLY AND GET OUT "
Let us suppose that , rather than Bruce Wayne's parents getting killed by Gotham muggers , they're killed off the coast of Africa while on safari !
The jet plane's first story was about a rocket ship who made up his own fairy tales . The rocket ship's first story was about a moon who made up her own fairy tales . The moon's story was about a princess who loved a beautiful prince that she could never touch , for she knew that if she got close enough to touch him she'd never stop , and they would both be destroyed , and all life on the prince would be wiped out as his atmosphere turned to fire .
But !
That works , right ? Because money itself isn't worth anything , but we all PRETEND it's worth the value of the goods it's traded for , right ?
WH - WH - WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAahem . As I was about to say before that panel shift . Utahraptor , so what if the panels fit a generic mold to suit any preceding event ? Other CYOAs work that way too . You either get killed by a shark . . . or maybe a lion ! ! !
" just as cool as it sounds "
Sorry dude ! I guess I just see a problem with any inspirational quote that could apply perfectly well to oh I don't know ADOLF HITLER ? ?
What you suggest in jest , I will do with conviction !
Science will wither in the face of my sense of community and sharing !
Someone who doesn't vote is CLEARLY super chumpy . But , ON THE OTHER HAND , someone totally uninformed who votes anyway is ultra chumps too !
Is it a . . . SANDWICH ?
Oh , just God !
Really ? No state has ever claimed to have reached a fully communist system , and so the term is inaccurate , etymologically speaking ? That's pretty cool !
The emotions we have in English are just labels we've applied to a SPECTRUM of feeling . You can almost always divide existing emotions into smaller , more precise chunks ! For example , your well - known satisfaction at eating cereal in the morning is an exact , identifiable , reproducible joy that I can only label " breakfast pleasure . "
What do you mean , " cute " ?
( open mouth ) I wonder what that stands for . " Overly Competent Dinosaur "
Um , I DOUBLE CHECKED THE NUMBER SYSTEM ?
Must have been a pretty big spider , yeah ?
Excuse me , sir , you look depressed ! Would you say you have a more accurate view of the world ?
Arthur laughed . " Guilty as charged ! " he said .
Utahraptor ! It's the guy who spins Will Smith at the start of every Fresh Prince !
I can't find ANY of the ingredients I need ! What the hell ? It's not like I'm looking for some ancient spice ! I JUST WANT SOME PAPRIKA .
I love picking up women in a park . I mean , I love the IDEA of picking up women in a park . I love the idea of being so assured in myself and in my own attractiveness that I could confidently approach a stranger and have her be interested in me romantically . I hold tight to that dream . It's never happened .
Yes ! I am the thoughtful friend who buys presents for no reason !
Yup !
What happened to room 404 ?
I think that this has been successful so far . Let us continue this experiment !
Does it matter how big your handfuls are ?
THERE'S GOT TO BE A LESS DEPRESSING WAY TO DESCRIBE YOURSELVES .
That's super sexist ! Powerful women aren't necessarily SEX WORKERS .
T - REX IN : " MOVIE ETIQUETTE . "
I've said too much !
No , that's wrong . I taught you the dance moves .
Folks say you should learn a new word every day . At that rate , you'd need a language with 30 , 000 words in it !
Seriously ?
Oh ! Oh man - that is an awful joke !
Wow . That's textbook irony , huh ?
Nuh - uh ! If I take credit for 100 % of what my brain comes up with , then I'm personally responsible for every stray , passing thought that bubbles up throughout the day ! NO THANKS .
I've bribed cyberneticists to ply their trade and enhance my fragile mortal body ! !
. . . Big into dogs over here .
Here we have a dead Dromiceiomimus , who died because she was too smokin' hot and too smokin' brilliant .
IS
I'm going to say the word " baloney " , so everyone who doesn't want to hear the word " baloney " should stop listening because here comes the word " baloney " .
Utahraptor ! Do you truly ask that i dismiss my many plans for my tomb to proclaim " THIS MAN SAID 'FRIG' A LOT AND , YOU GUYS , IT WAS SO RAD " ?
HELLO ! I AM NOT PROGRAMMED TO RESPOND IN THAT AREA .
We've built a whole system around ethics and you're questioning its foundation !
. . . MAN . That's water - tight !
Good to know !
I could give you some tips if you want !
Oh YEAH ? ? We'll see about that !
Also , this one time ? I ate a whole lasagna before dinner but my parents got me in heaps of trouble .
Aw man ! It wasn't on purpose ! !
HEY I BROUGHT SOME POTATO CHIPS , T - REX
They have all sucked like whoah !
Good luck !
So ! I intend to find a beach ball ! Do you know where they are kept ?
You know those guys who die in really stupid , preventable ways that are entirely their fault ? I'm pretty sure there's like a billion different timelines where I'M that guy !
Oh , Crap ! Detected !
Yes ! No .
I'm intrigued because the same thing also happened to me this morning !
GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE
T - REX EXPLAINS :
Mix it up ! Choose randomly from " Interesting ! " , " lol " , " how did u get this email address " , " HUH ! ! " and " i dunno babe " . People will assume you're replying manually ! How retro ! !
Really ? What are they ?
Okay , um . . . What's ten times two ?
I can't ever say " There , I've accomplished all that I could . " Things just level up to new challenges !
I will call it , " Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Mummy's Curse ! "
Varied , interconnected disasters now threaten civilization itself : ocean currents change , weather and temperate zones shift drastically , volcanic eruptions become commonplace . We're talking GENERATIONS of slow , sustained catastrophe ! Man ! I'm super excited to make this movie ! !
Excuse me , but what's that noise ? Is it SOMEHOW the sound of you becoming EXTREMELY BORING ? ?
Man , future archeologists are gonna love us ! " WHAT WAS POOP LIKE IN THE LATE 1960s ? "
I thought adventures were being chosen ?
I've shown that you're dealing with an Alpha here , baby , and not some weak Beta !
Dude , why couldn't you tell me his story instead ?
THE NEXT DAY , T - REX TAKES EVERYTHING FIGURATIVELY
It makes me feel kind of sexy , you know ?
Dromiceiomimus , do you have smoochitis ?
Many hundreds of years ago , things were done in different ways !
I'll go learn about immigration , okay ? And then I'll return here in exactly 24 hours and dazzle you with the nuances of my new , hyperinformed opinion synthesized from my own reactions to the many viewpoints I've encountered , alright ? ?
( superfulous panel B )
Shakespeare ! He wrote a lot of plays : REMEMBER THAT , because it's kinda all you you need to know !
Utahraptor the Utahraptor . How'd you get such a name ?
But this material existed before Darwin did .
MAYBE IT'S POWERED BY FOLKS ASKING LOADED QUESTIONS
God , how come we live in a world where these awful diseases exist ?
" dino chuckles " , the name , is pronounced with a short " i " , just to make it special . ] ]
He walks on my damn carpets with his damn shoes on !
I will say it again in French , friends and neighbors !
DON'T WORRY GUYS I'M ON THE CASE
WHAT'S THAT ? YOU CAN'T HEAR YOUR OWN CRITICISM AS YOU QUICK - TRIP BALLS , IN SERIES AND ALSO , IN PARALLEL .
I've got two words for you , world !
The moral of the story is then explicitly stated to be " LUCKY PEOPLE ARE LUCKY , EVEN WHEN THEY'RE SLEEPING ! "
Thank you ma'am ! I stayed up all night working on it ! The vestigial arms are made of paper mache !
Um - " That's not what happened , " she said , wiping her mouth . T - Rex realized it wasn't vomit , it was -
T - Rex , where the hell were you ?
it will be interesting I PROMISE
THAT DINNER FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO :
" Space . "
I've changed my mind ! You know what's great ?
What do yours do ? Dribble out salty water , but only when you're sad ?
These are , um . . . pretty sex - focused ?
Dromiceiomimus , we've been friends for over 10 years !
Beyond me , that is !
Sarcasm !
Like spicy leather ? I wouldn't have eaten them under normal circumstances , but , you know , free internet ostrich meat .
You want to be the first murderer in space ?
She had smoochitis ! !
I like to be prepared !
Ha ha ! That of course is my name , which is why I am responding to it ! I'm fine today , Gertie !
Instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold !
The sensation of it filling your lungs is almost entirely like drowning though .
" It was three years before the Great War ! "
Maybe you can present it in a more positive way ?
That , my friend , is the # 1 FIRST THING I'm going to change when I get elected as ruler of the world . Well ! That , and the political system that would entrust the fate of an entire planet with one dude , no matter HOW into horses he is .
My new , hyper - efficient bingo is basically like putting in your money , pressing a button , and being informed whether or not you've won .
That sounds like it's your first time speaking English , and uh , things aren't going so hot .
LATER : THE FACE OF PRESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE ? ?
What I meant to convey was , we gon' be using bugs
GOOD
It's like those cans full of fake snakes that jump out when you open them , but with the turkey ! And mashed potatoes ! And gravy !
You COULD stop it if you had absolute dominion over time and space , T - Rex .
But we , as a people , write stories about him anyway . We want so badly to hear stories about this fake guy that we pay people to make up tales about him ( this is called " lying " ) , and then draw pictures of their lies so we can see them easily .
At least the fridge used to be cool !
Sigh .
What's true for you might not be true for me , Dromiceiomimus ! Indeed , what's true for me today might not be what's true for me a month from now . I accept that there are many ways of living and that all that needs to be discovered is what is right for me , as an individual !
So if I say " the atomic mass of xenon is 131 . 3 AMU " , a response of " Oh , maybe it is for YOU ! " is a fallacy . But if I said " toast is the ultimate breakfast - time treat " , you could very well respond with " maybe for YOU , not for ME " and it wouldn't be a fallacy , because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal .
Until Ragnarok !
Only one !
KFC ! Like the place where they'll fry up a dead chicken for you !
I have the basic idea ! A whore is someone who collects coins , yes ?
any facts about horses included here would NOT be included in a printout , therefore if you clicked this link to learn even more about horses , sorry , today is a sad day for team you
Ew !
I'm down with this , T - Rex ! It HAS been a while since our last party .
Why would bacteria evolve such effective protection against an entirely nonexistent threat ?
Hey T - Rex , sweet tan !
OKAY DONE
I need not remind everyone that mites are similar but LEGALLY DISTINCT from spiders !
There was nothing great on Twitter .
This friend has failed to consider that I , like all REASONABLE individuals , have only enough room in my heart and mind for ONE friend of the same name ! Dromiceiomimus , you don't know any other T - Rex , do you ? ?
Eh ? Eh ?
WELL , last I heard he was starting high school a few towns over , so I presume he went through the development process that is high school and emerged a changed , taller man than the person I remember from our halcyon pre - pubescent days .
But what to say ? What to say ?
My new literary epic is about a man who puts everything in quotation marks !
You're MESSING HIM UP
It sounded like the sound dogs make when they're just about to throw up .
Did your plan work ?
Isn't the singularity when we invent superintelligent machines that can make even more superintelligent machines , and then everything speeds up ?
I NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO THANK ME FOR MY FRIENDSHIP T - REX
Rock star !
How do cities what ?
today's fallacy
IT'S TRUE :
Hey sexy / that sex was great ! / It is how / we procreate !
I use moss on trees to - wait , why are we playing this game ?
Why would anyone want to read about humans ? They're like us , but smaller and with more boring bodies .
And Pride and Prejudice is still this fancy romance story , but now it's framed by this dude being asked to describe the ultimate video game , and at the end the dude says " Anyway after that it becomes a turned - based strategy game with a focus on resource management " .
I cannot survive on my own and have yet to learn how to control my excretions !
It will be so awesome , Dromiceiomimus ! Can you imagine being friends with Science Personified ? You'd never have your science questions go unanswered . I'd be all " Hey , how does a bumblebee fly ? " and he'd be all " Yo , dynamic stall " and I'd be all " Sweetness ! "
Hey , can I buy a compliment , T - REx ?
Have you ever wondered why dinosaurs are so loud ?
" Look how prehensile it is , " he'd say .
It's difficult to reconcile the events in this song with established Beach Boys canon
And people will bid on you why ?
Aw crap !
I put down my fork and said that was good , since anything she ate would be , by definition , Indian food !
It helps maintain healthy nerve and red blood cells , and is also needed to make DNA , the genetic material in all cells . Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food .
And ?
Chip writes , " Dear Professor : how is free will possible ? ? How can my brain make decisions without the natural laws that govern it implicitly determining the outcome of those decisions ? " Great question ! Dromiceiomimus ?
They're going to be all , " oh man , remember when [ WHATEVER THE LATEST IPHONE IS RIGHT NOW ] was the latest iPhone ? " and another will say " you bojo ! Remember [ WHATEVER SONG IS POPULAR NOW WITH TWEENS ] ? ? I loved that song which I heard before I developed adult critical faculties . "
AWKWARD MOMENTS COMICS
The third was psychical .
THEN WHO DID ? ?
Or a solar scientist dude !
The advice ?
So invent it and convince everyone it's a good idea !
I sure do , baby !
Hindsight ! ! Oh my gosh let's move there , let's all be aware of our mistakes before we make them . PLEASE LET'S DO THIS .
I forgot to predict friggin' ROCKET BOOTS
What the heck , dude ? Why so into people watching you sleep ?
Those with your hands down : you are looking for Remedial Sexual Education ( This Is How Boinking Works ) !
I haven't seen it .
Our first letter comes from me !
I'm swimming naked !
I need to fix this .
Aww , T - Rex , we can still hang out and drink green beer !
They don't call it that ! They assume everyone else is just like them !
So yea , you've got to be careful , because the real Confucius said many non - hilarious things .
Okay but did you not hear the rest of my question though ?
Of course there's always a danger when you go down the 'date - the - person - you - live - with' road .
Huh ! I guess he surprised you !
There is indeed ! !
Exactly . They totally avoided the subject .
This means that for every perception , every emotion , even for every thought that I have , there is a corresponding state in my brain to match .
There IS a lot we don't know about humans .
How come a " master " and " mistress " are totally in charge of a situation , but a mistress is ALSO somebody's piece on the side ? How come " sir " and " madam " are respectful ways of addressing folks , but a madam ALSO runs a brothel ? How come a governor controls AN ENTIRE NATION , while a governess - wait for it - teaches a kid what a number is ?
. . . Okay
Proving your existence in a verifiable , repeatable way ?
And yet , you're talking about talking about it , so do you want me to ask what the crazy thing was ?
IN CONCLUSION , HAPPY BIRTHDAY
BONUS COMIC
I propose we undertake a voyage to no lesser target than the south pole ! !
. . . Really ?
T - Rex , you shouldn't joke about clinical depression ( major depressive disorder ) ! It's not very funny .
A conspiracy FACT .
And each crazy fortune is put in the cookie multiple times , so it seems like someone is REALLY trying to get that " MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM IN FIVE MINUTES , COME ALONE " message to you . Tada ! The world is instantly more awesome AND terrifying ! Thank me later , chumps ! !
THEY HAVE NEVER FAILED
Well , of course we wouldn't ACTUALLY do that , but the point is that we can never know the exact same information , unless it's 100 % guaranteed that the messages aren't lost or garbled . But the mail isn't like this !
Why Australia , T - Rex ? Are you intrigued by its myriad tourist attractions and locations of geographical splendour , including the Outback , coastal reefs , tropical rain - forests , crocodile farms , and the beaches ?
Okay , I'm changing mine . Mine are now pals , being smart , being awesome , being so great other people say I'm great in their diaries , and . . .
Be careful though ! Overplay this , and you may become separated from your familiar world !
Do Tell !
Heck , I'm way worse than YOUR NAME ! You should contact YOUR NAME instead and never contact me ever again . THANKS !
You know who's never been drunk ? NOT EVER ? NOT EVEN ONCE ? ?
There's lots of good ones .
Major snorefest !
What is this emotion called 'regret' ?
This story sounds pretty morbid , T - Rex !
Your time machine that goes through time but only at the rate of one second per second and only ever forward being the most recent example .
Okay , everything's fine , except you accidently killed Kayleigh's little brother Tommy ! Whoops !
And now I'm going to put everyone into a big garden ! Nobody eat the fruit of one particular tree , okay ? !
INDEED !
GOT IT .
Well - keep writing ! Eventually your stories have got to segue into somthing more original .
Well , I'm glad you asked !
You're sure it was here ?
I just bet I do this because I'm bored !
But THIS time , Robyn sat around the empty lot and waited for the ghostly store to return . When it finally did , she went inside : like she remembered , everything seemed real , if a little old - fashioned . She could touch things , hold things . She could walk upstairs , even though it was all a ghostly illusion . She talked to the storekeeper and half an hour later had bought the place out !
Fifty dollars ? !
I have decided not to entangle my own emotional well - being and stability with someone else . "
STORIES FOR MEN
Yes , of course ! * sigh *
Folks will know all of my embarrassing little SECRETS .
Pretty sure I wasn't that great a boyfriend , ladies ! !
WHAT IF I HAD NO FRIENDS COMICS
TIME TO GET INSPIRED
Aw dang .
SORRY THIS COMIC GO DERAILED " I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY iDEVICES "
But , they can't go out in the sun .
But also of course !
But what about the problem of entropy increasing in closed systems ? Where's the clock batter ?
That's funny , because you always voice every single thought in your head !
It's useful because it allows inferred meanings !
I can't ! I need INSPIRATION .
Our experiences of Real Fun mean the subtle joys of Crappy History Fun lie forever beyond us !
It was a busy day for Jim Rifle !
I celebrate it too . In fact , I'm pretty sure everyone celebrates it ! There's a big " Act Like A Dromiceiomimus " party at city hall tonight .
So your tip for " how to live as an adult " is " play more video games " .
I remember saying " OBVIOUSLY it was a dumb mistake , guys . It'll never happen again ; now I know to always leave plenty of time to get to the airport ! "
THIS JOB IS KILLING ME AND I CAN FEEL IT

Not me ! !
I thought " dickens " was a minced oath meaning " devil " ?
One of the things I've imagined , ever since I was a little kid , was how neat it would be if you could sort your life by events and view that instead .
I mean , I accidentally thought that if I could swallow a fork then if someone said " fork over your money " I could puke up the fork on their shoes , wipe my mouth and say " Maybe you SPOKE too soon " !
Who's the celebrity ?
P . S . : I'M NOT UPDATING THE SECOND PANEL
WHAT to the EV to the E R !
T - REX TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO AND I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT AFFECTS THE FUTURE
Holy crap . There's nothing not to like in my movie .
Even if a bunch of them don't do Christmas it's still like , WAY too many !
noooooooo
Oh no ! I'm dropping a barf right now because I imagined it too hard !
Because I was worried there were better things happening at a different party ! Every choice we make limits our options , and thanks to the internet we can be made consttantly aware of all the things we COULD be doing , and how well they stack up against the things we actually ARE doing !
Dude , I'm gonna ! I'm gonna go and get in line for some punch RIGHT NOW !
Giving us magic overnight would destroy us ! IN FACT , maybe that's why fairies themselves are so rare : When they invented magic , they nearly destroyed themselves with the sudden , unpredictable and corrupting power !
You mean " the human tragedy of the human commons " .
Aaah ! That's not the point ! RAGE !
WIKIPEDIA ! Oh my God ! has it stood for that all along ?
From . . . the internet ?
If gravity reversed right now I would be so pooched ! Please RT if gravity reversed right now and you would be so pooched !
So what would you suggest ?
I respect how you've made a career out of it , yet , it's still gross !
Living in a universe without you ? It was TOTALLY RAD , Utahraptor . I'd tell you more about it , but , you know .
My friend , I am simply asking the questions that need to be asked !
Lasagna !
That's a pretty strong conclusion !
Okay ! Good to know !
I THINK SO , DUDE ! ! WHAT TIME IS IT ? ?
Hah hah ! I would be like , " Hello ! "
Hiccuping forever is this weird sort of . . . forced immortality !
Wouldn't good storytellers want to help out their friends with a few stories ?
Dromiceiomimus , let me just stop you there . If you're going to say that emotions are FELT , not invented , and that as I couldnt " invent " gravity so too can I not invent a feeling , but merely observe and perhaps label it , then that is a good point that I should have considered myself .
. . . a trip to OUTER SPACE !

Everyone's always , " You know what the saddest six - word story is ? 'For sale : baby shoes , never worn . ' " AND TO THAT I SAY : what's so sad about buying cute shoes because they were on super sale and then realizing you have no possible use for them ? ?
Huh
" Intercourse ensues ! "
HEY T - REX HOW COME YOU ALWAYS SLEEP ON YOUR LEFT SIDE
I'm undressing you -
Dude ! I wanna aim it at the left half of my face and cause problems ! !
EVERYTHING everything !
WHAT .
No , you don't understand : it sounds awful when I put it that way , but it's actually really funny to laugh at strangers behind their backs ! !
OH CRAAAAAAAAP
What business brought you here ?
Anyway she woke up as a totally tough dude , stepping on houses like they were toy Monopoly houses , like in the picture ? Everyone liked her . But her female form was missing and eventually people thought that she was murdered ! Nobody believed her that she was a dude now and they thought maybe HE ( the girl ) murdered her ( herself ) . She went to jail and EVENTUALLY , she died in jail , from a terminal case of too much being . . . in jail .
But , it has also been SAD .
An older man , Howard , angrily tells Antonio to leave if he doesn't like it . Howard's lived alone since his wife passed , eating out every meal because he went from his mother's house straight to living with his wife and never learned how to cook for himself .

You know how sometimes you wonder what your life would be like , if only you made some decisions differently ?
An ancient evil , known only as The Eternal Flame , has awoken . The best our mortal minds can comprehend it is as a giant undead burning mass of eyes and flesh . When it looks into your eyes , it - - changes you . Turns you into something . . . like it .
So , what ? You've got a paradox !
Whatever , man ! I'm getting OLDER and CHUBBIER .
They'll contest it , or everyone will agree to redact the bear slappy clauses . Happens all the time .

STAYING HOME A LOT AND NOT DOING MUCH
With ice cream ! !
It stands for " I will flip the bird RIGHT NOW to anyone who doesn't like hugs ; I'm not even joking . "
But then he never follows through , because things are confusing ?
Utahraptor ! There's a city called " Batman " in Turkey ! ! I could have spent my life in BATMAN CITY becoming a master in the study of Frigg !
Could all " mountaineering accidents " be the handiwork of a lone , crazed murderer , loose about the peak ? IT COULD BE TRUE ! ! If so , no - one has survived their encounter with the pushy " Everest Eliminator " and lived to tell the tale .
Can I walk on your carpets ?
I was just trying to figure out how this new " racist " thing worked !
Do I ? Hell Yeah ! Maybe if I smash their log dojo and ninja - mobile they'll leave me alone .
Well , I'm perfectly content . Time to mix things up by staying awake for 41 hours !
That's been done before too .

SCIENCE VS RELIGION round two
T - rex , did you remember to do your taxes this year ?
Hi , T - Rex !
You've successfully made me no longer care about Sherlock Holmes ! Now I want to hear about the PLANET SHERLOCK , where everyone's a detective , especially the babies !
Poo bugs are SCIENTIFICALLY the lamest sorts of bugs !
I AM DEFINITELY FLIRTING WITH FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW ! !
" I think that if I had , I'd spend the rest of the day wondering why I'd lie about something so - - IRRELEVANT . What's wrong with me ? And confessing would also seem weird , because none of us would even know why I lied in the first place . I'd have to sneak the shovel back , I guess . Or destroy it ?

A common approach is to name the child after what you hope it will do in life . This accounts for names like " Jack " , " Sue " , " Carol " , and " Wade " .
You are repressing her free spirit and sexuality ! Notice how I am a throughly modern hero , despite my being born in the 1900s ? I am appealing to a hypothetical audience , 100 years in the future !
Did you know that during a Quiddich match , it turns out that one of Harry's teachers is a vampire ?

How do you know ? Maybe they weren't talking about self - cannibalism , and just wanted to know if you liked your own saliva !
But when they started translating , they ran onto some problems !
Therefore , since you can have an arbitrary number of 'really's , there are an infinite number of ways to say " I love you " .
What if you found something to do that bettered yourself AND the world around you ?
You and I know that from experience !

And since MY consciousness is the only one I can confirm , it means that outside this simulation , in my REAL life , I did something SO RAD that people are still trying to figure it out . You're here to ensure I act like I did before , and perhaps , at the end , to ask me -
. . . donate some friggin' sperm !
No way !
Ooh , let's ! !
We like it when you suck on your fingers , T - Rex . " I " , " I " , " I " , " I " , " I " .

Is it nice , Dromiceiomimus ?
HEY , HERE'S AN IDEA : let's spend our lives believing we always said the right things , kissed the right people and made very single choice correctly . Doesn't that sound nicer ? Like , way nicer to the ultimate max ?
Once upon a time , by which I mean around 636 AD , there lived a woman ? thelthryth who took a vow of perpetual virginity , because why not ? It's the 600s ! Virginity was in , vows were in , IT MADE SENSE .
No , that's the worst name I've ever heard .

YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY THE SEMICOLON USE AND , THEREFORE , CONSENT TO SEXUAL CONGRESS .

Not mine though ! In MY religion , God now has to pay me royalties every time anyone sees his tattoo !

The most important tip is to invest in at least a level 5 exoform : if you're going to pass for any extended period of time , the added comfort is definitely worth it . Be sure to show many human interests , such as in whether or not other humans like you , in images and stories of what other humans are doing or have done , and SOMETIMES , in getting naked and mixing genetic traits through gamete combination .
Chipmunks look adorable , but those little dudes run away when I try to touch them ! And koala bears look like they're so down to hug , but if you hug one they get scared and pee on you ! I'VE LIVED IT .
So the good news is that the raccoons and cephalopods aren't hanging around my house anymore !
I would tell you it's been a rousing success ! !
But they always operate as a group , right ? There's really only one ninja team , singular .

I would like to extrapolate this up to the societal level !
" There are precious few mysteries in space , " he deduced , " thanks mainly to our advanced technology and ubiquitous surveillance . That's why I can now indulge my true passion of starship piloting . "
WHAT IF , Utahraptor ? ?
But assuming the other players know that too . . .
Well . Maybe . But I feel comfortable with you ! I guess I do it for people I haven't known for as long . I'll do better next time , ok ?
And YES , if I had a mic on me , I'd be dropping it SO HARD RIGHT NOW , PEACE
My point is : if that jerk fired a light - speed bullet 50 million light years ago at where you are right now , you'll get shot right . . . about . . . NOW .

" My ultimate baby " , by me , T - Rex .
Right ! So part of your mind you can't control ( your unconscious ) must be at work there . But since you can't control it , it's effectively external , right ? So the rest of the universe is still external to you ! You haven't gained anything by imagining it's all in your head .
What's going on , T - Rex ?
It's time for another one of my TRULY EXCELLENT PARTIES . And you're invited Utahraptor ! Don't worry , I'll say it for you : " I'm totally coming , T - Rex ! This sounds awesome ! "
. . . Again , those ARE the two ways for relationships to end .
Your catchphrase is not only annoying , but OUT OF DATE . You should find a more modern catch - phrase !
And FINALLY , you could just have the narration mention the fact that Batman's Australian , and leave it at that . You don't need to rely on pseudoracist sterotypes !
Yeah , but it was . Correcting people's grammar in conversation is difficult to do without sounding like a jerk !
I lived in your house while you were gone !
It makes me wish we could have something like that , you know ? I'm TIRED of the same old vegetables .
YOU SAY ? OH , I GET IT ? BUT IN HERE PARADOX TOWNE THAT ACTUALLY MEANS ? OH BALLS , I AM HERE TO TRIP YOU ?
Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed , because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you . But less - frequent parts will be more malleable , which explains why languages evolve so quickly !
What does a black hole taste like ?
But I like emotions , T - Rex ! I like feeling happy and content and loved !
I think it's still foreshadowing .

Now all you need to do is make that funny through context . Tada ! DONE . Joke : created !
If all you have are black socks of the exact same size and style , then they'll all match forever and you can lose one and it's no biggie .

Suspect what ? That I'm secretly a genius author ? Allow me to be the first to say :
You did ?
if you do not like math then skip this comic ( seriously )
yes ple
did you know that ancient Greeks thought giraffes were a mixture of camel and leopard ? Scientists still call giraffes " Giraffa camelopardalis " because everyone's afraid that if we change it , the ancient Greeks will be SO CHEEZED OFF that they'll all come back to life ! ANGRY SKELETON LIFE ! !
There are layers upon layers !

GREETINGS TO YOU T - REX

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS
I - I think I can hear him ; it sounds like he's saying something . It sounds like - " T - Rex should have all the money in our wallet , that is called ETHICS . " ?
What is that anyway , a place ?
These insights are pretty superficial , T - Rex !
Got it . A way to share the most important sentiments I have , the top tier things I have going on !
Dromiceiomimus , would you say that I'm an excellent dude for walking around like I own the place ?
Hah hah , sweet !
The secret is to be CONTROVERSIAL !
But don't you find that these things don't work in real life ? I know I want my partner to be happy , but I also want all of his or her kisses .
Oh , excellent !
Oh , are we gonna talk about cultural relativism ? Cause I can talk about cultural relativism !
And then the dude would be like , " IT'S TOO AWESOME MY MIND IS BREAKING " ?
Doesn't work ! You could've JUST NOW set up the universe and given everyone fake memories ! And like , MOMENTUM .
For us , maybe !
For instance : being able to forget things and having nobody blame you !
Wacky .
HEY T - REX DO YOU BELIEVE MONEY MAKES PEOPLE HAPPIER
I had to turn up the tunes because I was going outside ! I don't have a " boom box " or similar portable music device .
Wow . Life surprises you sometimes , am I right ?
AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT
TWENTY TRILLION YEARS LATER :
And totally self aggrandizing .
One of the main advantages of brain transplants ( or body transplants , depending on how you look at it ! ) is you get a fun new bod that's not like your old one . But one of the main issues is scar tissue !
But how much particle displacement happens at conversational levels ?
But it can be useful : if your reaction is " no way that person and I could be married ! " then you examine why you feel that way , and by doing so tease apart what you think is important in a marriage !
Seriously , it makes me feel like doing whatever you say !
Okay , so hypothetical situation : let's say you've got two friends who used to totally date each other but now they're broken up , and neither wants to see the other anymore !

You will stomp nicely , young woman ! Good show !
UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL RELATIVISM

It looks even more like a butt if you underline your exclamation point : ( _ ! _ )
I send a message that makes Past Me decide not to send a message back in time . When he reaches the present , no message is sent , and the universe reverts to how it was originally ! Time travel might ERASE ITSELF every time it happens !
Alright ! New novel : done ! This one is a romance , and is called :
But the Bible shows us that language is mutable ! So what's the solution ? How can I ensure that the ideas I have in my head when I communicate are the same as those you get in yours when you hear me ?
Maybe I spend so much time thinking about language that it damages my friendships with others ? ?

Ewwwwww !
Stop slouching !
Like it's a boxing movie , and whenever the underdog hero gets punched , you get punched ! You'd start to think , " MAN , I hope that guy wins ! Then I'd get punched less ! "

Anthropomorphism is often used in childrens' stories where you have talking animals , but can also be used in more adult works ! This is because occasionally adults enjoy it when a cat is sassy . Sometimes , a character will be anthropomorphized by mistake , like when you write a play and accidentally attribute dialogue to a ceiling tile . The ceiling tile is said to be " anthropomorphized " if the oversight is not corrected in a timely fashion .
Man ! This is THE WORST Friday morning I've ever had ! In three weeks . Involving kitchens .
Clearly , my body is UNDEREVOLVED . Being able to be burnt by the sun - which , I don't have to remind you , Dromiceiomimus , shines on the Earth EVERY DAY - seems to be a pretty big limitation !
Observe as I INSTANTLY CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT GRAPEFRUIT : the red grapefruit people eat today DIDN'T EXIST 100 years ago . They were created by FIRING GAMMA RAYS AT PLANTS , hoping some useful mutations would randomly come out the other irradiated end . They emerged from the " gamma gardens " of the 1950s .
You stare at your fists as razor - sharp blades push out from between your fingers . Somehow , it only tickles . Somehow , you know life just got crazy sweet . SOMEHOW , YOU KNOW CRIMINALS WILL RUE THIS DAY .

Alright , I think I have gotten the " hang " of this " Twitter " thing . I've figured it out ! I've CRACKED THE CODE .

Hmm well yes , I think you are indeed a Dracula .
This , my friends , is the malaise of the glutton at life's buffet , The Man Who Achieved Too Much Too Soon . He looks ahead , his life not half over , and sees no more frontiers to conquer , no more challenges , no more surprises ! All that remains is a slow slide into compromise and old age , the long December spent waiting for the day his mind and body finally fail .
Maybe you mean the sun will explode ? Is it JUST our world that ends , or are other planets threatened too ?
Genius ; only I don't wear pants !
That's true ! I myself HAVE sexed up people with feet , but their feet were incidental ! Like , if they took their feet off before sex I wouldn't be disappointed at all . This'd be me :
I wonder what adventures I'll have today . . .
Okay , I'll try !
. . . and reasonably expect it to have already been LIVED OUT in real life ?
Maybe I'll forget to though .
Seeya
T - Rex ! That's not what I meant !
But -
And I'm doing it by bringing back " figuratively " .
T - Rex , do you want to come over this evening to watch a movie ?
Nothing bad ever happens when you eat the whole thing , you guys ! It doesn't matter what thing it is . I've NEVER had negative consequences from doing this .
Sure ! Like , right now , talking to me is an event . You're looking at me and standing during this event . Events happen CONSTANTLY , but we'll be good and reduce them to one per second .
People lie and get away with it . Murders go unsolved ! There are people who only interact with you because they think it might be profitable for them .
It comes from Latin !
Eventually you ignore the updates ! !
So it's like a pet , but instead of being cute , it pollutes ?
Aha ! But I didn't write it down in my REGULAR diary !
Have I done anything worthwhile with my life ?
ME
Gentle " me - statements " hints ( " I like it when you do this " ) can help someone figure out what works for you ! And if you and your consenting partner ( s ) are enjoying themselves , then congrats , you're good at sex . Don't overthink it !
How could I have forgotten
Stomping for me is one such pass - time !
hello T - REX you are handsome
Oh , regular folks . I call them " norms " , Dromiceiomimus .
I guess they really DID work at . . . The Office .
These are good , but they rely on a specific circumstances being true !
Oh ! And also people named " Mattress " . Duh .
Maybe it's no longer cute that you leave your dirty dishes piling up on the counter , huh ? Maybe you're at an age where your friends should be able to expect a certain base level of stability from you in your relationships ? Maybe there comes a time when you pay your bills before you spend the money on fun stuff ?
Sure , it's easy to say the Loch Ness Monster is a myth !
When economists say that , what they mean is you can't get something for nothing . That free lunch was offered by someone with an agenda , yes ?
" I wonder , " said one Batman as they saved the woman , " if there was a Simpsons marathon last night or something . "
Which is , T - Rex ?
But maybe it is ! What could possibly go wrong ?
Well , Dromiceiomimus , I think it's pretty clear .
That's only like TWO examples .
PS YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY THIS , NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN I PROMISE *
OH CRAP BIGFOOT IS REAL
MMM I MUST CONFESS TO HAVING THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION PLANNED OUT IN MY HEAD BUT I FAILED TO ANTICIPATE THIS RESPONSE
And now , all the dodos are dead .
THAT WAS A GOOD DUET T - REX I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPLY THE DUH DUH DUHHS
" OH NO "
To win a game of chess , you need to buy up the SECRET house !
Hey Dromiceiomimus , what time are you going to bed tonight ?
We may , in fact , be doing it now !
Which dude has a dentist appointment ? ! Throw your hands up if you're the dude who has a dentist appointment !
I think it's pretty clear , T - Rex , that I am the epitome of the male form .
Ohhhhhhh
Oh my gosh ! I'm ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that I've just had the best idea for a superhero ever .
I don't think so , man ! I think it's a side - effect of homophobia in the media .
Wait , what were you saying about pre - packaged sentiment ?
Seems like a pretty painful way to go through life !
And the party responsible ? An evil dog who , instead of always saving people , is CONSTANTLY putting them into peril : CORPORAL SNUGGS .
I guess the only safe one would be if the paper said " old age " .
It'll be UNAMBIGUOUS .
This is the last time I try to make you guys breadfast in bed , okay ? You suckers don't stay in bed long enough to eat a delicious breakfast surprise .
Can you check my eyes next , Doctor ?
WHAT ? ! Really ?
Right ! Well , there's something I've been meaning to tell you - something I should have said when we first met . . .
Banks are often robbed for the small amount of cash in the till , and often these tiny heists in which nobody is injured don't make the news and are left unsolved ! Crime doesn't pay ?
When I can wake up snuggled next to my car that loves me and eats carrots for treats , then finally we'll have recovered some of what we lost a hundred years ago . Also the cars should have cure names like " Abra CARdabra " !
T - REX WINS AGAIN
Dromiceiomimus , if you liked me you'd be laughing
SURE YOU ARE
The question is , is self - awareness truly necessary for spirituality AND IF SO , do squirrels have it ?
IT'S JUST THAT IS SOME HELLA CONFUSING SYMBOLISM
Did you hear that ? Utahraptor says the Sega Genesis was the best ever ! Did you hear that ?
Has anyone ever made a doctor - themed parody of Back to the Future , called " Back to the Suture " ?
Will NO - ONE sew it back on for me ?
Pretty disappointed this hasn't happened to me yet , you guys ! !
Alright , let's get the easy ones out of the way first !
BUT ANT MAN HAS A HELMET THAT LETS HIM TALK WITH ANTS . I BET IT'S A HELMET JUST FULL O' BAKED BEANS IS WHAT !
. . . Yeah .
Yeah and now it appears at midnight , but all it does is make ghost toast that disappears when the sun comes up . I'll tell you one thing : it's not bad . I use it as a dietary aid . Barely use my new toaster anymore , honestly .
Polygamous READING ? What's next ?
This gives me an idea ! My idea is what I was just talking about !
Vampires can have kids , Dromiceiomimus ! They can REPRODUCE through sex !
Why is this bothering me so much ?
What about if we . . . make new problems ?
Entire communities live on borders , some even straddling their imaginary line . And if enough people decide to imagine it differently , the line can change : you go to bed in Country Boringtimes and wake ip in Country Omega , where It's Always Two For One Tacos !
Was that like " Ah , that's amazing " or was it more " Ah , my friend has messed up and created something terrible . I need to let him know this without hurting his feelings - or do I ? Could it be best to let him make his own mistakes ? "
I know they conduct . . . semi - well ?
PLUS , I'll pick up everything with my mouth !
They freak me right the heck out !
This will consummate my social ruin FOR SURE !
Nobody is allowed to kiss my rad lips today , okay ?
T - REX IN : THERE'S A LOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT STUFF
And you'll never beat " The Puppy of the Baskervilles " !
It would be really nice to be able to measure that computationally .
Utahraptor , how long have we been friends ? !
This plan has a lot of benefits ! It's cheap , America already has the missiles and nukes lying around anyway , and a nuclear explosion on the moon WILL be visible from Earth . Plus it'd show those Reds who's boss !
I sure hope so ! ! That officer saved valuable keystrokes . Now he has more time to arrest criminals .
Ah , that's right .
First off , I don't know why you need egoism to justify the destruction you're going to wreak ANYWAY . Second off , egoism doesn't account for charity , unless you reduce it to 'good will in the bank' , saved for some future benefit . That in turn doesn't account for charity seen in lesser animals , who aren't cognizant of such self - centered account - keeping . In conclusion : it's untenable .
Then , if you survive , you're like " bro , dang , in what might've seemed like a second to you I spent a subjective 30 years reliving every single mistake I ever made , and it wasn't ONLY the mistakes I knew about : I also saw how things I thought were my successes were but new , more nuanced types of errors . "
When someone says " murder is wrong " , they're clearly making an ethical statement . But what are they actually saying ? Let's totally find out !
WHY WERE THERE DOLLAR SIGNS AROUND YOUR HEAD IN THE ALLEGORY THEN
Oh crap ! Is there like a school you go to for that ? Like . . . sailor school ? Boat undergrad ?
Are you tired of nobody caring about your " tweets " on Twitter dot com ? Oh no ! Have you become gradually aware that you're " tweeting " into a vast void of quiet indifference ?
Finally , we have the hottest thing : balls . If you have ever tripped balls , you know how hot they can be .
( She called them " glasses " but you can tell she was thinking " nerd goggles " ! )
Yeah , but chap , you know what I don't say ?
The Soviets have saved time by designing and sending a ROBOT to the moon - and it got there first ! Only , the Americans are able to land their ship faster , so they're still the first ones to set foot on the moon . But the Soviet robot is still there , and its orbit has been adjusted downward , ever downward , so that now it's flying just above the Americans !
THAT EVENING ( SET TO THE TUNE OF " WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD " ) :
Well ! Here they are .
THE HOLIDAY FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEPT REALLY WELL LAST NIGHT ?
That's not a story !
In the meantime - can't find a twist tie when you need one ?
I must have been two years old or something . But I've used that first friend as a seed to get me all my other friends and now I have this irrational fear that my house of cards will come crashing down around me !
My treat !
I went to the optometrist AGAIN last night , and AGAIN she said I might need to get nerd goggles !
Eww ! How did that ever happen !
Man , Chuck Norris did it already !
IT'S THE FUTURE !
. . . Go on .
Oh . That's less interesting !
I scheduled the sweet hangs !
Too true !
For most of his life he documented the disappearing " great race " of the Indian !
QUIT MAKING OUT , YOU TWO !
Really ? Wow ! What size ?
. . . as every human being who has a name that starts with " H " ! !
Oh , sir , BELIEVE ME , I can .
" Okay I will ! ! " shouted Sherlock , stripping naked .
I think that's egotistical and false dichotomy !
So what & # 8217 ; s he doing in space ?
But we all remember him when we're hungry !
Oh nooooo !
LISTEN YOU NEED TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE BETTER AND STOP TAKING EVERYTHING SO PERSONALLY
MANY YEARS LATER :
I'm sorry I was ever mean to you in the past , T - Rex !
T - Rex , you sure have been saying " damn " a lot lately !
* record scratch *
Today is a good day I think for talking about my love . . .
I'm not -
OR RATHER THERE WILL BE
But this time let's fix it , okay ? Let's drop the LEAST AWESOME elements ( the humans , OBVIOUSLY ) and let's make JURASSIC PARK starring ONLY DINOSAURS . Dinosaurs bring back other dinosaurs , dinosaurs attack , some dinosaurs eat some dinosaurs , and at the end ? Dinosaurs escape the island via helicopter .
I mean , obviously redirect the train , right ?
QUANTUM EROTICA is gay and straight and lesbian and other ALL AT THE SAME TIME , and it only collapses into a single sexuality upon being observed by a reader ! It's great and I invented it and guess what ?
" Things I Have Sat On : A Memoir "
Oh my goodness , Mr . Tusks ! Are you the MAYOR of Tiny Towne ?
hee hee hee hee
And YES it's embarrassing that when I was 12 I was really into Sonic The Hedgehog's relationships , and YES as a non - tween I now wish I had posted less about an imaginary hedgehog's relationships . But I know I'm not the only one who posted stupid stuff online !

ANY QUESTIONS ? ?
Well , the wedding went off without a hitch !
Things would be different !
Perhaps quiet contemplation is the correct response ?
um zero of my character are questing for space t - rex
She's a scientist ! SHE SCIENCES .
Holy !
Hey there !
That's a pretty eclectic set of decorations !
Anyway , they fight , Liberty ends up hanging off a cliff , Professor Death offers his hand , Captain Liberty refuses and falls to his APPARENT death while shouting " Liberty shall not perish from the Earth ! ! " . The end !
Hah hah hah ! No way !
Watch as I believe anything anyone tells me for at least ten minutes ! !
" I am the only non - millionaire in this pool . "
HISTORY :
I mean , if you're serious , I absolutely wil -
Dude ! It's centipedes , but they've got the HEAD of a spider !
THREE LIFETIMES LATER :
During the war , the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them - that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals . And of couse , after the war ended and the troops left , the cargo stopped being dropped too .
That was before you knew man and dino never coexisted ! Your interaction could have dire repercussions . It could tear apart the very fabric of space and time !
My sense of sight is useless when I sleep , because , like MOST men of taste and breeding , * I * sleep with my eyes closed , staring at the inside of my fleshy head .
We're criminals , but we're afraid of skulls . Lucky thing it's dark , because even if there were some here , we wouldn't see them !
I know ! And the best part : there's NOTHING illegal about it !
Sure , but one small shift in orbit , a slight change in temperature , and it's a catastrophe on a global scale . There's no wiggle room ; if our fragile world was only a little worse there would be no life on it at all !
I wonder : what's the strongest emotion ? What's the most powerful emotional experience I can look forward to ?
Let's have ( emotionally speaking ) consequence - free sex !
This is a sculpture I did of the child I hope to have one day ! He'll be a doctor , and he'll spend all his time helping others cure horrible diseases .
And the others ?
UTAHRAPTOR'S T - REX SIMULATOR :
Wait -
Being a Survey of the Fielde , tolde with equal parts Flourish and Paedogogy , epitomized by a plain and familiar Manner , without and unnecessary Mixture of useless Curiosities and needless Repetitions .
Having conquered time and space , Ryan North returns from the void
Your insurance company still saves a MILLION DOLLARS if they can somehow make it look like I murdered you . They'll be there , hands cupped around the policeman's ear , whispering " Listen I am almost certain this green dude killed him and made it look like old age "
No regrets , Lady Gaga ! !
hey there t - rex , how are you doin' ? it's me , morris
NO I MEAN IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW
What a handy mnemonic !
Okay ! In my constructed language , you now have to encode both how happy you hoped the event would make you AND how happy it actually did ! Just as English foregrounds when things happen , mine will foreground all the little disappointments in life , the countless daily letdowns of reality failing to live up to our expectations !
If you say that you were so hungry that you literally ate a horse , I want to see evidence that some horse lover is cheezed off at you . Similarly , if you say that you literally ate your heart out , the I want to be talking to a corpse . Or someone with distributed hearts . I don't know .
HELPFUL TIPS FOR ESSAY WRITING
Listen . I can tell you what my left hand has been up to for most of my life .
So how do you become famous in the first place , then ?
I'M TRAPPED ON A PLANET OF EVENTUALLY SUCKY DUDS
PORNOCRACY .
The baby one's sad because we meet two characters : the baby and the shoe selling parent . Your story doesn't have any characters in it , dude !
INTERNET DIARY COMICS
You are attracted to everything ever . Sweet ! Good luck , dude or lady !
The ability to create is not necessary to have the ability to criticize but NEVERTHELESS : challenge accepted !
But after smaller cusses didn't take , I worked up to the bigger ones . And even they weren't doing anything ! By the time it was time for bed , I was writing out things like " PROFESSOR CUNTBURGLAR " in my notebook , complete with doodled 3D effects !
I - I guess so !
OKAY : HOW TO MEET WOMEN
COMICS FOR HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN
It's too late ; you guys already know about the idea ! THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION is to now travel back in time and murder myself to prevent my gift promises from ever being made ! !
Here comes that utahraptor , again . No doubt to debunk my pseudo - philosophical ideals .
That's a stupid game .
" WE ALSO INVENTED VAMPIRES "
Really ? Huh .
I don't know much about it either , T - Rex ! I think you'll have to do your own research on this one .
Rejected ? !
Also : learning is not a competition ?
Thanks for your help , T - Rex ! There is no conflict between us .
No they don't ! They lock eyes with you and say " Are you doing alright ? " with a hand on your shoulder or something . Honestly , this joke seems like it could have been funny at some point , but you telephone gamed it in your head and it doesn't make sense anymore .
DID YOU KNOW : the point at which Mercury is closest to the sun changes ? DID YOU ALSO KNOW : the point at which Jupiter is closest to the sun rotates too , at a different rate ?
And it's ridiculous ! 3 . 8 BILLION YEARS of evolution and my belly still has problems if I eat ALL the chicken wings ? That might be baloney sandwiches !
Nope ! Its " hyperdrive " will catastrophically fail , exploding due to mismatched physics errors . I guarantee it ! These ships don't work outside of the universe they're designed for .
T - REX IN : " WRAPPING PRESENTS IN THE PLASTIC BAGS THEY CAME IN "
The first message sent on the telephone was " Mr . Watson , come here , I want to see you " , which is obviously less classy but still not terrible . It's a solid " Bro , let's hang out , bro " message ! Plus : it's got a nice Sherlock Holmes reference !
WELL ! In some cases the patient will be too aware of what's going on , and the test won't work . In such cases the patient is asked to lock their hands togetehr and pull them in opposite directions . This distraction allows the test to succeed !
I've read Greek myths , man ! I know you guys are all about SNEAKY TRICKS and IRONY and MORALITY TALES in which dudes get wicked punishment for BASICALLY no reason . I don't want to be in any noun - based morality tales ! Not unless the moral is " T - Rex Is The Best , Holy Cow You Guys . "
. . . Okay . I get that as God you're a font of knowledge , but ?
A : Yes ! Old stuff is FRIGGIN' EVERYWHERE !
Robin Hood was a guy who lived in a forest with some of his chums . Guys , he made tree forts !
Let's hear 'em !
LATE LAST NIGHT :
ANYWAY THE REASON I ASKED IS THAT I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FROM YOUR FUTURE SELF
Then we have a circle wipe to 8 hours later , and < x > has happened to them anyway ! Ho ho ! Whoops !
I never get sick . My sculpted body is invincible to all but the strongest strains of disease and malcontent !
Why did nature evolve to be SO CUTE and yet SO UNTOUCHABLE ? Where are the cute wild animals that LIKE to be hugged ?
The Malvaceae family contains several examples of the Useful or Tasty Plants , including cotton , cocoa , and okra . Nicely done , Malvacaea !
" Oil treats " ? Come on ! It's called " CHANGING THE OIL " , and it gets you a + 1 happiness in Car Car Simulator Trucko Boat 3 .
Right ! It'd be a MURDER BONANZA in the afterlife with everyone trying to become the most experienced ghost , if only to protect themselves ! !
How am I supposed to come up with original characters if all I red is Sherlock Holmes stuff ?
Just don't have nay blood inside you UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
T - Rex ! Science tells us everything is relative !
And I'm not even talking about that " we're all dying every second of our life " thing because YEAH , OBVIOUSLY , we're all dying all the time , thanks for reminding me , Captain I Say Stupid Things At Parties . I meant that I could be in the first stages of head explosion disease or any other affliction that can end a life suddenly and without warning ! Right this instant !
That's why we are shocked and horrified by a shoot - out at the local cafeteria , but barely bat an eyelid when we read in the paper that 20 , 000 Bangladeshi have drowned in the Pacific . It's just the way of things !
I agree . However , the lobsters could've had theor claws bound or pegged , making survival impossible on the ocean floor . The sinking of the Titanic would not have changed this .
Shakespeare is the greatest author in history , but all he's written is 38 plays and 154 sonnets about " how much [ he ] likes to gaze at yonder bosoms " !
I do try to eat MOST things .
. . . thereby making THEM responsible for the fact that you came over last night and ate all my damn pastries !
Thanks , T - Rex !
The ladies evolved some countermeasures though , didn't they ?
Well ! That's awesome .
Well , no , but -
This play is more abstract , for you see . . .
Now , this is trickier than it was before we invented " photography " and " mandatory government - issued ID " and " ubiquitous surveillance " and " automated facial recognition " . BUT IT IS STILL POSSIBLE .
NOT SO FAST !
SPECIAL " HEY , WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BEN " SECTION :
Aw , man ! FINE , I'll ask . Video games should be video games , shouldn't they ?
LATER , T - REX VISITS FRIENDS :
Dude , you're just going to produce a person who likes everything everyone else likes , who only knows the same stories everyone else knows , who only has popular opinions ?
SEE THE THING THERE IS
All of which point to a particular person . I mean , I'd then like them to invent time travel and send Future Regenerated Me back in time to me so that we can pal around , but one step at a time , you know ? I can wait !
Uzi or shotgun . Bang !
Noooo
But you're also special for what you know : information that's recorded nowhere else in the Universe !
Not bad ! I wish I could have tried it !
HOTT
Frig ! I am now ! !
They're so sad !
Nobody listens in the locker room when you say that though
No worries ! It means " Near or involving the tooth sockets " , which , come on , is amazing .
No , he's naked now . He's asking for your help in " The Mystery of The Two Close Male Friends Who Got Naked With Each Other ; The Mystery Was How It Was SO FRIGGIN' HOT " .
Listen , time travel's cheap in the future .
That's a bit rand -
T - Rex , I hate that this is now a question that's going to have been asked , but -
No . That has never happened , T - Rex .
I think this kinda just makes you sound like an egotistical jerk !
Really ? I thought it was low . People put hamburgers in warehouses , right ? Burger warehouses ?
Oh , I must have explained it poorly . I & # 8217 ; ll just act like I & # 8217 ; m famous , you know , get people to react to me like I & # 8217 ; m famous , and then kapow ! We have CRITICAL MASS for actual fame .
So how can I be faulted for that , T - Rex . . . IF IT WAS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT I'D LIE TO MYSELF ?
EVER FORGOTTEN SOMEONE'S NAME ?
Time for me to invent a new emotion ! THIS is the feeling you get when you've said the wrong thing to someone by accident , and it's awkward and you've both noticed it , but it's days later now and you're still thinking about it !
But not great .
LATER : ARCHAEOLOGISTS TOTAL T - REX'S CAR !
No , I'm looking for you !
Let's do this ! Let's remix a single thing over and over !
I AM good at doing dishes , and you are being SEX - NEGATIVE .
Insurance motivators ? Uh , building complicaters ? Domino frustraters ? Wobbley Times U . S . A . ? Um . . . Shakey Shakes Central ?
Scientists have studied them for years to come up with an answer to this question . These highly specialized scientists , known as " computer scientists " , have given up on studying their own fleshy bodies to instead study the hard transistors , the finely sculpted semiconductors , and the gleaming metal bodies of our strange electronic offspring .
And the best part is : that's what I was ALREADY planning to do anyway !
INCIDENTALLY , Utahraptor , somebody just gave me a shower radio ! Do I really want music in the shower ? I guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door .
As I grew , I found that I could run faster than a speeding bullet ! I was more powerful than a locomotive ! I was able to leap tall buildings in a single bound ( as so ) !
The first is to go further in something than anyone has before !
THE LIFECYCLE OF COOL
Listen , I have an idea . If you do not read any panels , we will never get to the end of this comic .
Ho ho ! Five stars ! Also , I value our friendship .
BEHOLD HIM NOW , AS HE TRULY IS
But you're not saying anything beyond " Given certain assumptions , religion sounds okay " !
Oh yes ?
Sure . But also ? OTHER PEOPLE .
GREETINGS T - REX I HAVE A QUERY
I love him ! I think he's great . He was good in the medical comedy " E / R " , the medical drama " ER " , and was not the worst Batman from the original movie arc !
One day Rachel was blasted back in time a thousand years ! It was a surprise to be blasted back in time , but at least she had her phone on her . She figured with it she could be a GOD , blowing these old - timey minds !
I was GONNA say " maybe recycle a little and stop peeing in the ocean " but since Earth Day is over , no worries ! FALSE ALARM .
Didn't you write a song the last time your hot water heater broke ?
Hmm I guess because it's a TOTALLY AWESOME NAME ! ?
Okay , so nobody has bought my Tuggy story . THIS IS THEIR LOSS . Tuggy and I don't mind . Instead I will give them another story , about a superhero ! A superhero called . . .
BUT , SECONDS BEFORE EVERYONE ARRIVES :
And that was a little thing called " sarcasm " ; look that up as well ? And then let's brainstorm a list of rhetorical techniques and we'll go over them together ? ?
And THAT implies that I've got to make these days count . It implies that every day is a race against mortality , and even though I'm doomed to lose this race , second place isn't so bad .
Mankind was foolish to unleash us upon the world ! Who are they to play God ?
Who spent their Tuesday night doing the BEST THING POSSIBLE ? ? The answer : me !
" Wait , I just threw - " , and then we were smoochin' ! I THOUGHT she was going to say , " . . . out all doubts I had about our kissing in the near future . "
AND YET , if I seek your fat stacks in exchange for the service of not sharing this secret , I've committed a crime !
THAT'S FAIR
The plan was that the cat could listen in on sensitive conversations completely unnoticed !
TIME TO PREDICT THE FUTURE , BABIES !
FRIG IT'S STILL A REFERENCE .
Turn to panel 4 to unwrap a finger !
I'll see you next VIDEOGAMESAREFUNDAY ?
They're like little pillows .
" The afterlife is not what I was hoping for , " Tiny Ghost sighed !
" excuse me , this food is mostly holes " is a cool thing you can say at a restaurant if you really trust me a lot as an authority on what cool is ] ]
Are you - you're going trick - or - treating this year , T - Rex ?
She's my sister from another mister !
Animals sometimes have names that share the first letter of their species . Tony the Tiger , Katy the Kangaroo , Ernie the Elephant , and so on . Ridiculous ! But just as ridiculous . . .
Once this song is written I will , anyway !
What a country !
( in comic form ! )
What was he rapping about ?
It's so overdone . I no longer enjoy STOMPING .
Some men want me too ! and some women don't want me ! A lot of women don't even know I exist !
Argh ! ! So inane !
Hey Trex , check out my used band - aid
Excuse me ? I'm having a hysterectomy .
No problem , T - Rex !
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD BACHELOR PARTY THOUGH
Um - I kinda realized that I'd like to have children one day ? But I need to have a girlfriend for that first .
True , yet also boring !
People in history times sure were wrong about a lot of things ! They didn't even know what a germ is . Hah hah hah !
Maybe I'm aiming too low with getting a street named after me . Maybe the REAL awesomeness is when you get a CITY named after you !
T - REX HAS A BELLY ACHE
Anyway , it's going to be great . We're going to do all SORTS of things that we can't normally do at parties because WOMEN are around ! Bachelor parties are DUDES ONLY .
What the hell , man ?
It's too bad you're not a doctor !
Excuse me , everyone ? You saw what just happened ! What do you think that driver meant to convey ?
Alright , that's it . Attention , everyone ! I have an announcement to make ! I don't know when people started using " brain " as a verb , but i find I am forced to give it my full endorsement ! !
I'd like to see an example !
AHHHHHHHH
It would be a disaster for society !
Dude , my nostalgia's so deep that KIERKEGAARD'S still struggling through chapter one . Check it : when I move out , not only am I leaving behind the place , but I'm also leaving behind who I was when I lived there . But since I haven't moved out yet , that's still who I am right now ! Somehow , Dromiceiomimus , I've developed nostalgia for myself !
But THEN it turns out the duplicates were evil , and evil Santa fires the ray at the Earth itself !
I would've at least added some suffixes !
SCIENCE CORNER
LOOK I'M NO PHYSICIST BUT WHAT IF IT'S THE OPPOSITE
If there was a problem , yo , I'll solve it , check out ?
" Oooh , look at me , I'm T - Rex and I've found another way to be terrified of the future ! "
Why yes , I am freshly showered !
Utahraptor , is it bad to be friends with someone just because of their name ?
I'm feeling better now , everyone !
Um , my muse says otherwise ?
HOW COME I CAN THINK OF SUCH AWESOME THINGS TO DO ON XBOXES
My friends , I have the solution : The T - Rex system !
WHAAAAAAAAT
That's pretty crazy , T - Rex , but what about . . . " CHRA - HAY - ZEE " ?
But T - Rex , what about my , um , significant other ( s ) ?
The solution , as in most things , is smooching !
Being at my first wedding is exciting , but also makes me nervous !
Oh man , I can't wait to hear how awesome EVERY CONVERSATION EVER will be now !
T - REX IS ON THE PHONE :
- damn it T - Rex , clearly I was going to say " only if you don't stomp on that woman . "
Besides , that's just doing TWO things at the same time , and I can do SEVERAL . For example , right now I'm walking AND talking !
Yep ! This continues a theme in my life of being terrified of all that can go wrong with my brain . Hey , you wanna invent a way to transform our minds into something non - physical so that we can live safely forever ?
Or in other words : Rock Paper Scissors . So awesome ! The lizards are playing it endlessly , only they're way more hardcore than us , because they're PLAYING FOR SEX .
So Batman is ignoring Wayne Enterprises . Then what happens ?
If you like music but can't play an instrument , tell people you're " a hummer , not a strummer " . If you like sports but get winded and need to take breaks , remind all that you're " a sitter , not a quitter ! " If you have sex for money but people think you've been slacking off on the job , tell 'em you're " a sex worker , not a sex shirker ! "
THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGG : A FAIRY TALE
" Sherlock Holmes was an out - of - copyright detective which meant I could write my own Sherlock Holmes stories ! " , Sherlock Holmes screamed .
HOWEVER I DO CONFESS TO ACHIEVING UPWARDS OF
Either that or you haven't realized that I'm just leeching all the awesomeness I can until you're nothing but a desiccated corpse , with all the awesomeness subsumed into ME .
I know ! !
It's simple !
I - I would actually watch this .
So supertasters taste stuff the rest of us don't ?
. . . I think about stuff like that all the time
Stuck in a depressing routine , where every day seems the same as the last one ?
Yes ! See ? YES .
I - I meant in relation to my story .
The one that can't even go naked into space without dying !
i imagine the first step is to ascertain what sort of trouble he's in !
Experimenting with hypochondria ?
And if it ends up being pretty boring , that's a snoregy . Or a boregy . Worst case : cure , it's an adoregy ! If they're not , it's a choregy . And depending on where you have it , it could be an offshoregy , a grocery storegy or a Vietnam wargy .
You're telling me ! What's neat about it , though , is that it's AUTOMATIC . Even if you're aware that it's a distraction , the Maneuver still works !
The dude doctors didn't like this ?
Oh , I actually listen ( and read ! ) through fantastic luck , guessing at what words mean / are ! Thern to talk I just flap my lips and folks seem to get it ! I don't get it ! I don't really know a single thing about any language . I'm just incredibly ASTRONOMICALLY lucky .
But I did go through life without ever saying " five essential moisturizing oils " !
You wrote a sex scene ?
Maybe ! !
GET the heck OUT .
Hey you ! You've got a stupid face ! I - I want to punch it !
I was new , I didn't know what I was doing , and I'd seen a lot of movies .
I'm serious ! If you kiss someone and it's a sucky kiss , that just escalates the awkward moment ! And I don't mean to brag , but I'm a pretty great kisser . One time I kissed a guy and he said , UNSOLICITED , that it was the best kiss he'd ever had .
Hey , here's some things you've never done ! you've never tried fugu , punched out a ghost , gotten married , eaten your way out of a whale , gone heli - skiing , or been shot at by a criminal , but then ran around the bullets at super speed , grabbed the criminal , and then ran back at super speed so that he could be shot by his own bullets .
I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY CLEAR
I'll say that !
Um , ACTUALLY I was hoping to get through life not knowing that ? ? GOSH .
Couldn't you also call them . . . " ACTS OF GOD " ?
Seriously ! What happens if a gorgeous , intelligent , funny woman asks you to be her valentine tomorrow ? Are you going to shoot her down because you're denying that Valentine's Day exists ?
I discovered some bad news yesterday : my bicycle needs a new seat !
We assure you TeethBits are OPTIONAL BodyPartz and are unlikely to affect other systems .
What manner of proof have you ?
At some point someone had to sit down and sad " Whoah ! Hold on , everyone ! I just imagined an invisible something SO IMPORTANT that if you refuse to imagine the exact same thing , then we all get to kill you ! " That's some pretty hard - core imagination , fella ! One time I imagined a hat that you put drinks in and then you get to drink out of the hat , but it turned out that was already invented .
Like . . . I don't know . . .
I think it's not ! I think it's time for us to eat ALL - YOU - CAN - EAT CHICKEN WINGS .
Ladies !
That's more " nickname " than slang , dude !
Not even !
Shakespeare spends pages wildly inaccurately describing life in the 1800s ?
Not all ghosts are scientists !
That may actually be the case !
You ever think you're putting in too much backstory in one sentence ?
The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read , Mark Twain ! Come on . I thought we were on the same page here buddy .
It's the reason I've never really attended any political marches - I can only rarely convince myself that I believe in something SO MUCH that those who don't share my beliefs are wrong , and need to be publicly convinced otherwise ! I'm always conscious that I may one day look back on my present - day self and shake my head .
Perhaps through . . . sexual intercourse ?
It . . . used to ?
Vitamin B12 has a very low potential for toxicity .
Aren't these just superficially altered Asimovian laws of robotics ?
Your screenplay once again , appeals only to a micro - niche market !
Man ! Dromiceiomimus is crazy . I've done tons of stuff !
" SORRY BABY , YOU KNEW THE RISKS INVOLVED IN FALLING FOR A GUY WHO AVERAGES ONE FIANC ? E A DAY "
Enter in that word to continue Star Trek TNG trivia .
Hah ! Ouch for PROFESSION MEMBERS , and their stereotype !
THANKS FOR TAKING IT FOR THE TEAM ?
I hear you !

They're alright ! They get by !
Okay , okay , so we can modify our personality , right ? We're not the same people we were when we were six years old , and part of that has to be controlled by us .
Oh geez I forgot that part !

BEST ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES , BUT WITH DOG ANALOGIES
I'd seen it a little bit but they were all talking about a particular episode , so I played along and talked about it too . Eventually I asked a question , I forget what , but it somehow CLEARLY REVEALED that I had not in fact seen the episode at all . Everyone turned to me , and one guy I barely knew said " Why would you lie about something like that ? " I had no idea ! All I could say was " I don't know . "
Anyway , dear recipient of this card : the sender had a good time last night , even though you didn't have sex with him ! You don't NEED to have sex to have a good time . Just like me !

But I'm beginning to suspect that the dance moves were in me all along !
Wouldn't it be super weird if one of the rooms you didn't check had an axe murderer in it ?
Here is a man who is known primarily in relation to another person . He's not " Star Reporter Jimmy Olsen " or " Enthusiastic And Inventive Lover Jimmy Olsen " ; his main claim to fame is being another more successful guy's friend . How does that make him feel ? What does he think about when he's lying awake in bed at 3 in the morning ? ?
I disagree , my friend !
Anyone intelligent could have come up with a " power punch " , sure , but imagining a bear that can punch other punches ? That requires what can only be called . . . " super genius " .
If I sleep the wrong way I can get an intense pain in my neck that follows me around for days . Days !
T - REX PICK A WORK ANY WORK BUT MAKE SURE IT'S A NOUN OKAY
Huh ! This really sounds like something he'd come up with . Anyway , I'm pretty sure this would be sucky , because we'd all be in bed thinking " get up " and then thinking " I don't see 'up' here " , and then thinking " get out of bed " , " stand up " , " and so on " , until we hit the right syntax to get ourselves moving . No thanks !
So in " pi - imal " it would be about 10 . 2 ? Approximately ? Look , it's gonna take an infinite number of digits to represent the answer .
Dromiceiomimus , horray for summer ! ! Would you like to come with me and Utahraptor to the cottage this weekend ?
I really want to live on " T - Rex Lane " , you guys !
I understand , Dromiceiomimus !
Walk it off , everyone ! !
YES , my friend . OH YES .
I'M KINDA LINGERING ON IT
I WILL LITERALLY DIE
SOON .
Pretty sweet deal , babes !
Because I'm pretty sure that's what happened !
Should I try new things ? Should I get good at old things ?
That's not really romance , T - Rex !

Awesome ! ! You're going to lose , by the way !
Okay , honestly , I wanted to talk more about how deep and important some friendships can be , but we've somehow moved away from that .
No , I'm afraid that doesn't interest me !
OKAY SO
I'M COOL
But ours is a generation buried under the bloat of ubiquitous surveillance . Future biographies will read " Zygor was the great man who led Earth to victory against the Saturnians . NSA records show he was big into cats who wondered if they " can has a cheeseburger " , which was old meme even back in 2025 . His porn consumption usually happened between the hours of 1 and 2 am . He most often searched for " boobz 4 doodz " .
Let's discuss !
Alright , I admit it ! I knew it was bad for me , but I ate them anyway ! And - sometimes I don't clean my house as often as I should ? Oh ! And one time I pretended I was deaf .
And therefore we are all saved from a zombie apocalypse and you can thank me later ! It was easy ; I just used logic !

So , whatever ! He talks like he's a 1920s serial villain . We all have idiolects . For example , you're a man who says " dude " and " awsome " in places where he could instead simply say " chap " and " I say , that's quite agreeable . "

I GUESS I can print up a 2061 calendar and circle a day there for FREE
So what's the problem , besides your unnecessary storytelling ?
And I get that it's meant to comfort , and I respect that ! I just don't like how it implies I'm sad because of a bad deal . I'm sad for the loss , you know ?

Really ! Wow , that's quite a development !

I PROMISE THIS STORY TOTALLY GETS BETTER
I sure am great !
When you call me " needy " , T - Rex , you make me feel like I'm crazy , just because I want to spend time with you ! That's not crazy : that's what friends do . If you don't want to be friends with me then we should talk about that , but if you do , then you need to spend more time with me .
You are ? ?

Peta Parka II was a human , but thanks to the bite she INSTANTLY gained the proportional speed and strength of a dinosaur ! However , the dinosaur that chomped her was way larger than she was - 6 . 8 metric tons to her 70 kilos , so she ended up with but a tiny fraction of its speed and power . Like , 1 % of it . BECAUSE THAT " S HOW PROPORTIONALITY WORKS .
Spinning made the earth bulge at the equator AND pulled water up onto that bulge . With it gone the oceans settle above and below the only dry land left : a huge megacontinent wrapping around the equator .

This holiday of yours seems to have spread a lot of goodwill !
It's just - you seem distracted !
Who knows ! Some sort of fruit , could be anything ! There's definitely no time for details , when you're writing a BIBLE !

Holy crap ! !
Dear audio diary : today I may have accidentally registered myself as a sex offender ! WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY LIFE
So first we should decude what kind of food we want to eat , basing it on previous foods we've enjoyed . For example , I like to eat ice cream and meat .
Okay , so the first secret to being patronizing is to react to everything people do with an aloof amusement , as if it's so PRECIOUS that they did something all on their own . Aren't you just so SPECIAL , Dromiceiomimus ?
Alright , I get it ! You hate jogging !
But before that , do you want to come to a party tonight ? I've got lots of food and drinks and I'm inviting only the most interesting and therefore sexy people .
DORD
VIDEO GAMES
And then a king stops by the house and finds her there unconscious !
Now we're gonna have to use out cleverness because it's PROBABLY well - protected , seeing how it's the only real kilogram in the entire universe .
Fold the raw meat into the ice cream , and brown in a giant frying pan . The ice cream will melt , sugars will burn , and grease will float on top of it all . Will this taste good ? WHO KNOWS ? ?
Hah Hah !
By T - Rex , " the owner of mind that brought you the erotica for adults with problems ? ? "
Sure ! But the point is , the female words are polysemous in a way the others aren't . It's like if " Utahraptor " meant " good pal " but also " sex worker you hire to do your dishes because he sucks out loud at sex . " Would you want to be called " Utahraptor " ?
My job is " astronaut "
DUDE WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THIS THOUGH
Well , do you want to come over now ?
1990s : effective cardiac tissue regeneration is now possible , allowing the organ to survive even host death . Also , an upper limit to sexiness is found . THE END .

Did you know that St . Patrick used to be associated with the color BLUE ?
What ? Zero replies ? ?
Whoah . You got some weird things going on in your head , buddy .
That's not the new catchphrase though . I've got - I've got different ones . And here they are ! " Let's get remarkably frisky " ( useful in many situations ) , " That's gobbles ! " ( meaning " that's crazy ! " , short for 'gobbledygook' ) , and " I lose at sex " .
I think there's posters in the library warning about that .
It's cute that these tough guys have no idea what's going on ?
It'd be awesome !
And I was a very good student !
DROMICEIOMIMUS ! ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME AND IF SO WHY ?
Will you vote for me ?
Can I come over and see it sometime ?
" Ah , Mr . Maldives : why such uncalled - for rudeness ? " Stan replied calmly . " I'll show you rude , you asswipe ! " Angola replied , and again our rating was raised , this time to NC - 17 .

Well , you know that you need bigger arms than yours to box with , right ? You need arms like mine !
Is that alright ?
Maybe I really am great , just impatient , and when I get home tonight there'll be a sales report in the mail showing how my books are now TEN TIMES MORE POPULAR THAN THE BIBLE . It would make sense , since they have like twenty times as many jokes in them !

This is the true cause of the seismic events reported in the media .
Colour me dateable ! ! !
HOWEVER : there are some rules that CANNOT be bent .
I wish I had more time to talk about this awesome premise ; OH WELL
I just wrote " Email Responder TWO THOUSAND " on a giant novelty chef's hat , taped a page from the dictionary to it , and then stuffed the whole deal into my computer's CD tray !
WITH THE TV ON ?
T - Rex , your relationships with women have been characterized by confusion and misunderstanding and briefness , and AWKWARDNESS , as far as I can tell !
And then you go on a date with one ?
Well I don't know about felt either , but if I ever need to , it's all there online . Treat the internet like offline storage waiting to be loaded into your active memory , and there's not much you can't potentially know !
UM IF I'VE DONE THE MATH IN THAT METAPHOR CORRECTLY THE RACE IS ACTUALLY 10 , 000KM LONG
ALL YOU CAN DO is hope to use your real - world knowledge about crops and tables to figure out what's going on . And it's even worse with words like " overlook " , meaning " examine " but ALSO meaning " miss noticing entirely " . Can't rely on the noun there !
That's not bad ! That's immortality for the self - centered !
And then you need you [ sic ] make sure your child grows up to be EVEN RADDER THAN YOU , because that way we all get more rad as time goes on . And that's something we all can enjoy !
today's technique : ANTHROPOMORPHISM
Hmm , but would it be better to be both young and in love .
Yeah , I guess you could see it that way .
I bet I can figure out hundreds of hilarious differences !
It's SO GOOD , Utahraptor !
TWO SECONDS LATER :
Well if it's any consolation , you're not THAT sensible . You've done tons of crazy things ! You just THINK you're sensible because you always did them for reasons you believed were rational .
It said " Going home for dinner ! ! ! " Is it because you . . . like dinner ? Is it because you thought you might want to peruse your favourites by the fireplace in your old age , come across this ancient post and say " Ah yes , this brings me back to that ENTIRELY UNFORGETTABLE TIME " ?
Dromiceiomimus , I wanted to talk to you because I'm - um , I'm a little upset that you didn't bring me back anything from Australasia .
I still think it's weird to imagine marrying someone you already know !
LATER , PERFORMING AID WORK IN SUB - SAHARAN AFRICA :
Holy crap !
Yeah , that's - that turned out gross .
* gurgle *
Sure ! Maybe life itself is divine !
The manliest thing in the world ? Easy !
And if you try to use a nickname on YouTube he pulls you aside and says " Hey . HEY . Don't you want to use your real name instead ? " and when you say " No , that's crazy , never ask me that again , why would anyone want that " he says " Okay , I'll ask you again real soon . "
I dunno ! An alleyway with a puppy shivering in a cardboard box , huddling closer to the unmoving bodies of her brothers and sisters ? ?
You'll thank me when you share my politics !
Back To The Friggin' Future !
Yes ! Filled floor to ceiling with jerks , each of them saving all their toots for the elevators ! !
You don't , T - Rex : you join it . You - embrace it . Don't call us " the Contamination " We just want to . . . elevate you .

T - REX SORRY FOR INSULTING YOUR BEATS IN JUST A FEW SECONDS

Yes ! We didn't have SCIENCE to tell us what was good and bad . We just went around gobbling whatever !
Utahraptor , GREAT NEWS . God and I are going to trade places !
. . . Is it discredited children's books ?
What do you know about building a car out of cardboard , T - Rex ?
MONTHS of innuendo and implications have left me without any meaningful context . I no longer know who , what , why , where , when , OR how .
WHEN I GET ONE
Pretty nerdy , my friend !
We're doomed ! Damn this dystopian future ! What kind of world have we made for our children ? ?
ANSWER : THE UNITED STATES !
Not in the new version ! In the new version you choose who you rescued and it says " OKAY , I AM GEORGE CLOONEY . BUT AM I STILL MAN ? ? "
Aww . Thanks , Utahraptor !
There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit , T - Rex !
I like your stories better with happy endings .
Whoaaaah
> i didnt type in yes ! ! it already had it typed in ! ! !
I will ! Right after I stomp on a few things to work off my anger , that is !
Maybe this isn't the best idea ever , T - Rex !
BELIEVE ME , some days it's work .
God , WHO I USED TO THINK WAS KINDA COOL , is talking about everything being eventually torn apart by accelerating universal expansion !
Listen dillweed , you gonna take me back with you or what ? ?
Backup plan " A " is labelled " handlebar moustache " !

Count me in too ! What could possibly go wrong ?
There's no way to express " eating " without revealing to the bros when it went down !
The airline had a strict " no crybabies " policy , and wouldn't let him board , no matter how he protested . Prejudice . He pointed at his eyes . " See these ? These are tears of PITY . " But as he stormed out of the terminal , he knew that they were really tears of frustration , mixed with the standard tears he always produced .
You know what ? I find the existence of those plans DOUBTFUL .
Once upon a time , I , T - Rex , dreamt I was a butterfly , fluttering hither and thither , to all intents and purposes a butterfly . I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly .
I'M just glad I avoided this whole ridiculous situation ! "
Maybe I should get some laser eye surgery .
No , no ! Come on , it'll be great .
Please do !
Oh , really ? Someone's literally made out of random body parts , and they all just happen to be boy parts ? And even if they're not , whatever genitals Dr . Frankenstein happened to grab on the way out are the most important part of thon's identity ? ?
Exactly ! And brining it to a bank just means I'm out $ 5 ; they wouldn't exchange it for a real bill because then the counterfeiters could just go to the banks too .
Exclamation mark ! It tells you that something SO fun and SO exciting is happening , even the author of the story was like ,
One particular member of this family grows in wetlands , and ancient Egyptians would eat it as a tasty treat . Time went on and an extract from this plant was used as a flavourant , which was eventually mixed with sugars to make a sweet flavor slurry .
T - Rex , you should watch this movie ! It's so bad it's good !
God , it would be more convenient for me if other people could hear you .
I'm just fine !
GREETING T - REX IT IS I THE DEVIL - I HAVE A QUERY TO PUT TO YOU AND IT GOES THUSLY - DO YOU THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR A COMPANY TO RELEASE A REMAKE OF A VIDEO GAME
While individuals may be fragile , species can survive a very long time ! Why not see individual lives as single cells in the species : A multi - cellular multi - generational organism ?
That's - um , that's beautiful too ?
So you assumed ! But , think back ! Did you ever see me wearing pants ?
NO IT TASTES LIKE DELICIOUS BLUEBERRY
What about you write your story and let it stand on its own merits , and worry about your blurb later ?
This one's for humans only ! When a human has a baby , it travels through one of them human birth canals , and then the doctors measure and weigh and clean baby up , and then bring thon back to the mom . They'll also give the baby eye ointment ! But why would a child need eye meds right after birth ?
NOT REMOTELY GOOD ENOUGH .
What ? No ! It's an allegory !
They're named Euryale and Stheno and like Medusa they have crazy snake hair too ! And they're more powerful than her because THESE sisters are immortal .
Me too !
I AM THE WORST GRANDSON EVER .

PHILOSOPHICAL zombies , that is !
People actually think your dog has super powers ?
Come on guys , I just want to pay the bill and leave ! Why can't I find a waitress when I need one ?
T - REX FROM THE FUTURE TRAVELS BACK IN TIME TO THIS EXACT MOMENT
I represented vanity !
THAT was a lucky guess
Well , I don't .
ALMOST . It actually gives me the strength of twenty girlfriends !
I know you want to , Dromiceiomimus !
" In conclusion : it's untenable " ? YOU MUST BE A LOT OF FUN AT PARTIES !

" Well , almost in unison . Antonio Tony , the man , was a little slow on that . It was because he was thinking of his taxes . '10 thousand dollars in taxes ! ' , he though , 'That is a lot of money . Where am I going to find that money ? ' Then Tony and Amelia had sexual relations . "

Isn't it opposite day for Utahraptor , so all his questions are actually answered with " no " ? ?
SOMETIMES you're a kind of handy guy to have around .
What if we're standing ?
THINGS THAT T - REX HAS GOTTEN FOR FREE IN THE MAIL COMICS
Well , you're in luck ! I ran into one of the old neighbourhood kids today !
I wonder , is happiness such a valid goal ?
The sad fact of the matter is , we all spend a lot of time writing our name , and most of us have finite lifetimes . If ONLY we were given names that could be compressed to initials without losing any semantics , am I right ? All the ladies names " H ? l ? ne " know what I'm talking about !
That's because I am troubled !
Okay ! Okay , try two !
Oh , so a MAGICAL FAIRY who can make ANYTHING SHE WANTS OUT OF GARBAGE has somehow manufactured actual slippers PRECISELY in Cindy's size : a woman with feet SO UNUSUAL that her footwear won't fit ANYONE ELSE ALIVE ? ?
And it seems I bled all over my pillow during the night , and then when I woke up my face AND sheets were covered in blood !
If you ever need some help getting groceries , Morris , I bet we could help you out !

THAT NIGHT :
A dinosaur dreaming that he's plagiarizing 4th - century BCE Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi ?
hah hah hah !
I mean , I get that depression ( UNhappiness ) has a host of issues associated with it , but what I'm describing is more Ahappiness - the ability to not need happiness at all ! Happiness is this - this FUEL that we need to function in society , but it doesn't last forever , and then we need to find more . It's like food , only it's drained every time we have to do something sucky ! Also , you can't buy happiness at a grocery store . I'm sorry , Safeway , but you just CAN'T .
T - Rex , he's going around making people give him all their money !
Antonio Tony nodded curtly , taking off his pants . It was so obvious . Amelia locked eyes with Antonio , paused , and took off her shirt . Antonio smiled appreciatively . 'There are so many bad laws passed through a misunderstanding of how computers actually work , ' he thought . Amelia's breasts were pretty great . Antonio was hot too but THIS omniscient third - person narrator is into the ladies .
Change is good !
What's . . . what's updog ?
For example , add vinegar to baking soda !
How do cities get food in 'em ?
Now that you mention it , I have !
That - that was terrible .

JUST AT THAT MOMENT , DISASTER STRIKES !
OH MY GOD
Only a little !
you have to include web sites , emails , spam . . .
Today's origin story : BATMAN
I'm not sure that's the case ! Plus , friction would eventually make your butt catch on fire .
This is MY town - a dirty town , but I'm gonna clean it up . . .
How about " We have cured all diseases ! " ?
STAT
" Let's restore the beach to the way Sister Therearediseasesyoucantevensee intended . "
God , you're basically like a super hero , right ?
YOU WILL
This has the problem of robbing you of your present , history , and self , however . Most people like those things ! So Method # 2 is using happiness - inducing DRUGS and ALCOHOL .
That's neat ! You could cheat and have 1920s title cards ( " DUDES , FORSOOTH ! I'M SO DEAD " ) but just silent images would also be cool . What would you have ?
And don't forget " spinster " !
Anway GUESS WHAT , that's what England did because of reasons !
We think time travel might not be possible - - RIGHT NOW , ANYWAY - - because we don't see any tourists from the future !
Sherlock Holmes And the Mysterious Genie , by me : T - Rex ! Also featuring : my friends !
Yep ! Do that and now your nail can pick up tiny metal paperclips , as if by MAGIC . Heck , it may actually BE magic , for all you know ! Is it magic ? Let's all decide that it is .
But I still think you should apologize for your " poop - eating dog " comment though .
I think the hardest job must be the job of Hallowe'en puns . They've all been done ! You're never going to come up with anything new .
Faith , AND the possibility of weaponized kissing ? ?
That's very resp - actually , T - Rex , that's exactly as responsible as you should be .
There's no way it's anyone else . Oh my God , Dromiceiomimus , do I go up and say " Hi " ?
TWEETING .
Okay , so record yourself on camera when you've read my book you can watch the footage and say " Hey , I made a pretty sweet T - Rex . Maybe I should read that book again . "
What ? Daaaaaang !
Oh my goodness , it's been SO GREAT . People with stupid opinions now IMMEDIATELY acknowledge how dumb they are ! Internet fights still have all the swears and name calling , but now they're instantly undermined by my new suffix .
Okay ! We're digging up stuff all the time , right ? And talk to any archaeologist and they'll complain about sites that have been damaged or destroyed by under - informed Victorian archaeologists that didn't have the knowledge and skills we have today . Doesn't it stand to reason that in 100 years we'll be making the same complaints about today's work ? We only have so much history . Shouldn't we wait until we've perfected archaeology before we dig ?
They made the first voyage to the very deepest part of the ocean , the Challenger Deep . It's a first , but it's also a FARTHEST , as these guys went literally as deep as you can go on Earth . It's a record that only be tied , not beaten !
Geez , that conversation went WAY better in my head . At least it did when I practised it in the shower , each and every morning during the several weeks leading up to it !
No , but I don't have any doubt in myself , see ?
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA !
Is it Friday ? That's great , because Friday is a good day for secrets , and it's the BEST day for
When lower life forms mate they do it because they're hard - wired to . We're totally superior because we do it for feelings and emotions !
So where does Mario go ?
All she did was sit in a chair 500 years ago and suddenly Wikipedia's all " AW HELL NAW , WE GOTS TO MAKE A PAGE ABOUT THIS ! ! " I can sit in a chair ! I can smile enigmatically ! Check it out !
Biscuit fever is here to stay !
Do giants exist ? The answer is no , because come on , they're giants , they're so big and we would've noticed them by now . Sorry giants , but you are all fake .
booooooooooooooners
But it's hard to find out more , as it's such a politicized debated . Everyone seems to have an agenda !
The number of atoms in my body is probably around 6 x 10 ^ 29 . That's a 6 followed by 29 zeroes .
1 . 029 percent , to be precise ! !
AND YES , I WILL BE CHECKING TICKETS ! VERY CAREFULLY . WITH MY FACE
Yes , I am a new , more thoughtful dinosaur .
Is there a tenure path in " watching fun cartoons " ?
Homophobia ?
I've seen a sexy giant ape suit .
Men !
So I've been working on a little project : a secret internet diary ! And today it's finished !
Later , at the bookstore :
A valid attack , perhaps strengthened by the old " What if we're all just brains in jars " question !
He's not even anthropomorphic !
Flirting with it , anyway !
IN THE FUTURE , our actions and beliefs will be evaluated by standards we didn't have !
No swords . Not even a wee li'l one !
IT TURNS OUT SUCH ROOMS DO NOT EXIST :
" In this one , Romeo's death somehow CATAPULTED HIM THROUGH TIME to our present day , where he works as an engineer . He's pretty good at his job . WHAAAAAT ? ? "
Ah well . I'm still glad we invented paper !
NEW SLANG FOR TEENS
THIS BLOWS ! I WILL NEVER KNOW THE ANSWER FROM A REAL SCIENTIST IF EVERY - BODY HERE IS A DINOSAUR !
Dude made a joke about the 762nd decimal place of pi ! At that point , there's a sequence of six nines in a row , and his joke was that he'd like to memorize pi up to that point , so that when reciting he could end with " 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 . . . and so on . " Others had noticed it before FEYNMAN was the first to make a joke about it , and now his joke is encoded into the very fabric of the universe !
T - Rex sometimes you misunderstand things and it's better than comprehension ever could've been .
You're going to say that I've made a positive impact in the life of my friends , ET CETERA , but I'm talking about - well , I guess I'm talking about public love and recognition . You know who won a Nobel Oscar Price at age 26 ?
This listing says you must be ABDL . What does " ABDL " stand for , Utahraptor ? " Always Boning Da Ladies " ?
Plus , there's probably tons of strategy guides and stuff online that would cover anything you know and then some .
Feelings : let's talk about them !
He decides he must become . . . Abe Atman !
T - REX'S CORPORATE SLOGAN GENERATOR
But why stop there ? Why not sweat grease instead , so hot days make us skinnier AND tastier - smelling ?
Therefore , I won't believe in things like faith healing , because there's no room for faith in evidentialism ! I also don't believe there's convincing evidence for anyone having kissed someone SO HARD that both people exploded , so I will have to regretfully concede that I don't believe that's happened yet either . But , at least I won't believe in anything I can't prove ! Thanks , evidentialism !
I mean , is there any reason to be shouting ? Have we lost a puppy ? Are we dissatisfied with the taste of tar ? Do we hurt our feet by CRUSHING PUNY LOG CABINS ?
JUDGE EVERYTHING BY THE SAME STANDARDS YOU'D JUDGE A ROMANTIC COMEDY BY DAY ?
You wake up as a spooky mummy ! Woah . Looks like you got mummified , but now you're alive again , as tends to go in these cases .
Yes ! This will be handy for me , because people is sometimes wrong !
Until they figure out inside body to inside body poop beaming .
" WHOAH , HOLD ON A SECOND , THIS ACTUALLY TOTALLY RULES ! ! "
FUN FACTS ABOUT . . . ARISTOTLE !
Right , and you could probably find history teachers to take the more common artifacts !
That's right ! I've finally confirmed what we've all suspected !
You chop up two potatoes , two tomatoes , and one onion , and throw them all in a pot !
Whoah , I think you're putting to much into this , T - Rex !
What about winning at wrestling a bear WHILE WASTING FOOD ?
Thanks ! " You're pretty great too " are those special words that every woman one day hopes to hear .
Yes , frig ! Frigs and dangs , drats and cruds . Heck !
My only hope is to get them to kiss at the " Enchantment Under the Sea " dance !
In a very real way , there's no point to it
I think that time travel might not actually be possible !
It's EASY to do a vampire / vampire brain transplant ! And since their bodies won't reject any foreign materials , you can just wire up nerves manually with like , tungsten . It'll take time but who cares ? It's not like your patients can DIE .
If I get a Koopa Troopa tattoo , I know that no matter what happens to me in the future , no matter what jobs I take or interests I develop , I'll always be , AT MINIMUM , the sort of guy who has a Koopa Troopa burned into his flesh .
God ! But it seems that AS USUAL only I can hear him !
I took one , but that was simply because I saw the HILARIOUS PRANK POSSIBILITIES of leaving one in a married friend's wallet . But then I had an EVEN BETTER idea ! Next to each of his divorce fliers , I put up my own that say " QUICK MARITAL BLISS ! $ 295 . 95 " . Hah hah ! It is PUBLIC SPACE ART and it also makes bus shelters less depressingly pro - quick - divorce !
You're . . . saying people should plan their children around when they think TV might be good ?
" 'Yep , she's not dead ! ' said the cop . 'I guess I forgot that when I said she was dead before . ' "
Mussels look gross too , and truffle fungus is delicious but looks like , and in fact literally IS , a fungus . How did we start eating these things ?
As I see it , you're pretty much asking to be put in a situation wherein the food runs out , people betray one another , frozen corpses of friends are found in the morning , and eventually everyone resorts to cannibalism .
Ninja turtles !
The answer is simple : this light exists outside public radiological models .
I look forward to your future , T - Rex !
Well what's the stereotype that applies to you T - Rex ?
. . . today !
The acidic and anaerobic bog water will preserve and tan my soft tissues , while dissolving the calcium in my bones ! The end result is that thousands of years later , someone will find my body , still posed as I requested it , just a little floppy because there's no skeleton holding me up . THIS IS HOW I WANNA SPEND ETERNITY . Also , posed giving a Fonzie - style double thumbs up and holding a sign that says " Dudes , What's Shakin' . "
IT'S MONDAY ! LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS
YES , WE WILL .
That's ridiculous !
But I'll have to be careful about this . I want TEMPORARY amnesia ; I don't want to end up not remembering anything ever again !
That sounds like a really satisfying way to live your life .
You haven't seen them ?
You can't take that
Yeah , only his example was about water having a different composition on Twin Earth , instead of those hauntingly stupid chocochops you invented . The point is that both thinkers have the exact same mental state but are saying different things , and the environment is responsible for meaning there .
Maaaan don't tell me it's been done before !
Just because you'll benefit from something doesn't mean you should do it !
That doesn't sound so bad !
There's a set store of short words , right ? A hoard , if you will . If we used all the short word forms for weird and rare verbs , like , I don't know , " to eat a lot of pork " , then it would take a long time to share a thought that did not come down to " Dudes ! I want to eat pigs ! "
SUCK IT , WET SAND
So what's her origin story ?
Do you think that'll make a difference ?
It's more than that ! ALL books you'd read before my story he dreamed last night and the ones you read afterwards he's dreaming tonight ! Every book EVER is now an ANTONIO dream !
ACTUALLY , ONLY PARTIALLY
" Antonio Tony and Louisa Q were two people in love ! ROMANTIC love ! "
In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England , with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30 , 000 km2 of land ! The land was incredibly fertile , the natives helpful , and he'd already established an army , banks , civil service AND democracy there . You couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground , and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate ! !
Ridiculous ! There's friction in the wheels that -
Yo , Salt , I looked around , and I couldn't believe this : I swear , I stared , my niece my witness ! The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda . . . UH !
Professor , there must be SOMETHING I can do to convince you to take this assignment . . .
So , at best , WE'VE only done a little over half an orbit - so we are exploring the universes ! We're going where no dinosaur has gone before !
Hello ? ? It's a total eclipse of the heart !
Angola Maldives , my cool superspy character , found himself staring down his worst enemy : Brussels Samoa ! And guess what ?
If I can think of an even better idea involving harvesting babies than Utahraptor will NEVER steal it from me
WHERE'D I PUT MY KEYS
THUS CONCLUDES THE STORY OF HOW T - REX ENDED UP CLEANING HIS TOILET ON A FRIDAY NIGHT
not really ! !
So in conclusion that's TOTALLY how I ate all the cheerios !
Alright everyone , listen up . We're gonna do it this time . We're gonna power through and we're gonna learn about SONNETS .
The T - Rex Story
Nat adores this Frankenstein - esque creation for several reasons , including the fact that he's warm , dignified , AND good at crying . Natalie goes on to tell anyone who will listen that they are NOT that man . She then runs out of faith , takes off all her clothes , and lies on the cold floor . It's embarrassing . She's embarrassed .
I know yet more secrets !
At the bottom of our list we find the grapefruit , a pretender which steals its name from not only a more popular food , but from one which itself is already a fruit . We don not need grape fruits and grapefruits ; the grapefruit cannot help but lose in any competition .
I'm Midtown High's only professional wallflower !
BUT - maybe she's NOT at the grocery store . Maybe she's nearby , and by going to the grocery store , I'd miss her and we'd never meet ! Maybe I'm sabotaging my future RIGHT NOW as I speak !
ATTENTION , EVERYONE ! Genghis II punched Romeo IV on the nose !
I never knew my father !
WRITING TIPS COMICS
Yep ! You press the button for " MAN " and he says " OH NEAT " and if you press the button for " WOMAN " she says " COOL , I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT TO BE THE CASE " .
Man what's the deal with nobody hearing you but me , God ? It's a hassle !
WHAT DOES IT SAY
I BELIEVE THERE EXIST SUPERMODELS WHO KISS THOSE WHO KNOW THINGS ABOUT AUGMENTED REALITY IN FACT MOST OF THE PROMINENT AR RESEARCHERS ARE MARRIED TO MODELS OF THE SUPER PERSUASION
Holy crap ! ! That was the first time I ever called someone " bro " ! !
THEY ARE GAMES PLAYED ONLINE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF STRANGERS
The girl guessed name after name but none were correct . Finally her friend spied on the man , discovered his real name , and told the girl . When the girl said " Your name is Rumpelstilts - kin ! " , the man was FURIOUS . He screamed " The devil told you that ! ! " over and over .
Usage depends on the speaker .
Also anything to do with heredity : their fault .
Because they're fun to think about !
Also my eyes should spew nanites please and thank you .
LONG FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD FRIENDS COMICS
Briefly !
IT TURNS ANYTHING INTO A GOVERNMENT .
Friendship annulled ! !
THE MEANING OF LIFE
IT'S SO BAD .
It's not that bad , T - Rex !
Lou Gramm wants to know what love is . He also wants to feel what love is . Finally , he wants you to show him what love is .
I love exercise ! Strenuous physical activity is fun and makes you feel good !
Come on , this is all the same joke !
Here's something that I , T - Rex the talking dinosaur , have trouble believing in : true love !
I wouldn't be able to enjoy it .
Fashion is WAY TOO HARD .
Nothing I want to talk about anyway , frig .
I can see not knowing them as a child , but if you're going to be an adult , you need to know at least some of this stuff .
. . . Go on
Hah hah , looks like what could've possibly been THE GREATEST THING EVER TO GRACE THIS PLANET was forgotten by the few pounds of fatty meat I carry around in my skull !
what's a webcartoonist
In summary and in conclusion , ghosts and zombies allow us to explore the intricacies of soul ( and body ! ) ownership .
YOU ARE HAVING AN ELEPHANT OF A GOOD TIME .
MAN , DID YOU SEE HOW EXTREME THAT MOTHER WAS ?
Man ! !
There's no sequels . You died
I will give my hand in marriage to the fellow who creates for me the most lovely yet comfortable fake leg .
how embarrassing
I'd hoped that more people would die in an amazing " spun so fast a tornado formed around him and sucked him into the sky " , or " flew into the sun " , or " all the oxygen molecules in the room randomly bounced away from him so he suffocated in the resultant temporary vacuum , oh well " way - that sort of thing !
I know ; I should've listened to you three years and four ulcers ago ! But damn it , this database gets results ! I've got three upstart databases here that'd LOVE a shot at his job , and not one of them can do in five CPU cycles what he does in three .
T - That's not an explanation , T - Rex .
It's about a tiny chef who makes tiny food for everyone !
I see ! You're going to befriend some musicians , purely for the hope that one day one of them will turn out to be a jerk and insult you and then you can use your elaborate zinger on them !
Oh , nevermind ! There really WAS a spelling mistake .
And we don't think " Irish cooking " without " potato " , and South Korean food is big on Western peppers too ! It must have been an exciting time , trying these new meals that nobody on the continent had ever tasted .
OH , WOW . . . .
I'll be teaching TWEENS !
- ap ! Also frig !
Oh wow ! This conversation went way better than I was anticipating ! !
ENTERTAINING
My pin was too common to interest a museum , but the rest of this stuff COULD be given away like that !
MAYBE I'M BATMAN .
HELL YEAH !
No , when I say " what do women want " I mean -
I could look around and say " In ten minutes it's going to rain ! "
But that's the thing : everyone else has ALREADY learned how to do it , so I'd be needlessly duplicating their efforts if I learned it myself !
Rules two through five are various socio - economic and anarchic justifications for not going to class . Rule six says it's really too bad that all the ladies are in class right now !
Got FRIGGIN' COCKROACHES in your house ? No problem !
I'm not upset with you ! I'm just tired today .
I'm just not !
Tagging can really be seen as the next logical step in ads : self - advertising ! It can be seen as the price we pay for a culture that has saturated itself with advertising : individual brands , internalized campaigns of self - promotion .
ZERO OF THESE FACTS ARE TRUE T - REX
Dromiceiomimus , would you like to come over tonight for a big " American Thanksgiving " dinner ?
This is what literally everyone will say , OUT LOUD . We've built a civilization that can alter the basic building blocks of FLAVOUR HERSELF , and like CHUMPS we're using it to reproduce things we can already eat . Frig , no wonder extrasolar civilizations haven't contacted us yet !
Okay , how about my lovemaking strategy ?
Solve both problems with my email to sexy Snapchat converter !
Tiny woman , you are NOT on my list ! Prepare for a stomping !
I just met you , and this is crazy , but you just told me your name and I replied " nice to meet you " and already completely have no idea who you are
On account of your many feelings ?
You're ignoring some of the immediate consequences of your actions .
( Duplicator rays let you make perfect copies of anything ! )
What we think is good is relative ! It changes between individuals , cultures AND over time . Some people think grapes are great , some people hate them with an intensity that scares even the Devil .
Aww ! I like a frozen - in - time universe way better !
How could you make something so crappy ? !
What , did this boy have tiny bite - sized sheep ? Was he running a sheep farm for ants ? !
THAT'S NOT IN THE PLAY
But she's paid for that !
Morris , you are . . .
OH MY GOSH , T - REX'S TWIN BROTHER ? ? NO , IT'S T - REX ! I MESSED UP WITH " MEANWHILE " AND SHOULD'VE SAID " MUCH LATER " .
Mad enough to stomp on a house ?
What if they're wrong ?
I see you've rebuilt your house ! Too bad I'm the personification of its destruction . . . in a MANOR of speaking !
Definitely Gonna Win ; Definitely Gonna Place , Anyway ; Horseasaurus Rex ; Two Chicks In A Horse Suit ; Two Sprinters In A Horse Suit ; Actually Four Smaller Horses I Just Taped Together ; Actually A Giant Dog I Found ; Future Horse ; Back to the Future Horse ; Back to the Future Horse 2 ; Marty McHorse .
NOT ANYMORE ! !
You could be : Batman's just training and determination . But you're imagining life as him rather than training to be him ! And I'M criticizing you instead of training too . We're ALL falling short of being Batman , every second , every day , and that costs lives . We're monsters . We all are . We're history's most average monsters .
So , I accept that I am the epitome of the male form with typical grace . But what is with my getting a sunburn ?
T - Rex , I believe this has already been capitalized on . . . by Alvin and his associated Chipmunks ?
And by making myself more charismatic , I increase that chance , which thereby increases my Green Lantern Ring Potential ! !
It's the story of my life !
Clearly , my personality is Important ! It's why my friends like me . But strokes can change people's personality , and anyone can have one at BASICALLY any time ! It's totally ridiculous . My body already has like five ways it can betray me for no reason that I can name off the top of my head , and those ways are called Alzheimer's , Old Age , Respiratory Failure , Heart Attacks , Terminal Boner Fever , and Dementia . IT DOES NOT NEED ANOTHER .
MAYBE I'M BUSY .
Sherlock would never do that ! !
What the hell kind of question is that anyway
So some future dude went back to a SUCCESSFUL assassination and messed with the guns ?
Oh no ! What a sad story !
RRRrrrRRR
His mom agreed that the breakups were all definitely the woman's fault : they simply weren't princess enough . One day , a princess showed up at his place for shelter for the night ! The mom had 40 mattresses on hand due to hoarding , so she put them all in a giant stack and said " Here , sleep on this . "
Send me half your Pulitzer ! !
CASE FILE # 4253 UPDATE
Oh shoot
I got my ideas about Italy from cartoons !
OKAY BYE
Plus I'm out fifty bucks ! !
The End , by T - Rex , ps : my soul is chaos !
Because whenever I don't know what to say , I'll just exclaim " Sounds like a good date ! "
But what ?
Alright , ASSUMING some baseline reliability of my physical senses -
Yes ! You also need FAT BEATS .
WAIT WHAT
Horses ! Are you interested in erotica ? Well GOOD NEWS , because I've taken some of my limted life and squandered it creating
I'm instantly convinced that I could !
Congratulations ! You know how to read .
All you've done is throw some stupid words in a stupid framework ! It's so stupid !
Anyway , to the internet !
Whoo ! It's cool to be cool !
YES . YES I AM .
Well , I guess I'll talk to you yesterday ! See you . . . SOONER ?
Yeah ! It would be amazing seeing how some artists react , knowing the best epitaph they could hope for was " runner up " . I think you'd see a lot of esoteric music , exploring areas that aren't in the number one song !
Dude , I'm serious . Alphas are like . . . broken . Nobody wants alphas . Or betas , really . They want normal software that's mature and stable and got past any " alpha " or " beta " crap years ago .
Ah , anachronism ! It can also happen by accident , like when an author forgets that people didn't write with ballpoint pens 100 years ago or that elves didn't have friggin' computers . Sometimes if it's a really obvious error it can be played for comedy .
OH CRAP WHAT IF THEY MAKE A NEW PHONE THAT'S BETTER THAN MY OLD PHONE ? !
Utahraptor ! Can I borrow your time - reversing ray real quick ?
My problem is an understated sex move ?
where are the knockers
DARN IT .
And FYI , I'm experimenting with emoticons in oral media , not with naming parts of my digestive tract .
. . . / Utahraptor I'm sorry but I'm sending you back to joke school .
Um , why don't you talk to him about it ?
They're doing work without costing energy anywhere !
Yo , some days I wonder why I walk past Dromiceiomimus so quickly
COMICS IN WHICH ALREADY - NAKED DINOSAURS DEBATE THE MERITS OF SWIMMING NAKED
DON'T EVEN , dude ! !
So as I was saying , for all intensive purposes , the REAL bro here is ?
TO THE STABLES
Morbidly INTERESTING !
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TOTALLY FORGOT HOW AWESOME YOUR NAME WAS
SHORT VERSIONS OF CLASSIC WORKS OF ART IN COMICS FORM
It's a wonderful idea .
Not me : that's for darn sure !
Dromiceiomimus , you're totally looking at this the wrong way ! This October has FIVE WEEKENDS in it . If you count Fridays as weekends - - AND YOU SHOULD - - then there's a full 15 days of weekend available this month ! Fully FORTY - EIGHT PERCENT of this month is weekend ! That's fantastic .
It's a prayer , " reuiescat in pace " , which also works in English with about the same meaning : rest in peace . It comes from the Christian tradition , which at various points and to various people has held that there is a time of " soul sleep " after death but before judgment .
Nope ! As the sayings go , " Claims of cyborgnicity are lies until you can see incandescent red eyes " , and " All cyborgs are null until you can see a chrome , gleaming partially exposed skull "
Also , HONESTLY , I don't think they've ever tried being poor ? ?
How does it feel ?
Huh ? There's no allegory . Just a twist at the end when we find out the whole thing was psychosomatic !
Luckily , I could just ask Invention Personified to come up with a way to settle the argument !
When misanthropic old man Chip finally does of old age , the last thing he expects is to come back as a little devil on his granddaughter's shoulder that only she can see ! But his grumpy words of wisdom live on , now that she's got . . .
ARE YOU AWARE WHICH VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS NOW THE BEST OF ALL TIME
I can demonstrate , my friend ! Ask me where I picked up a word like " autodidacticism " !
Close ! It's where you don't eat meat unless you're given it for free , like from a dumpster . You prevent meat from going to waste , but you don't support its production .
" I SAW YOUR NAKED CROTCH BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT "
For instance : the word " awful " ( really bad ) and the word " offal " ( burchered entrails ) !
So then what happened ?
Ooh , ouch . Was that a bad pun ?
. . . okay , wow , that corn fact is pretty cool actually
Sometimes you want to eat corn without hearing how corny it is .
Free bridges for the strong - willed !
No , T - Rex . This is a tasteful thing you to do after you die .
WHAT IF YOU DON'T DIE FROM A BULLET OVERDOSE THOUGH
No - one wants you around or even wants you still alive !
LATER , T - REX IS UPDATING HIS DATING PROFILES :
AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR

Like pouring the milk into the bowl BEFORE the cereal ?
Being incapacitated by the sperm cells of plants ? Super tough ! And nothing's manlier than dripping mucus all over yourself !
So what you're saying is . . . the other mes across the multiverse are DRAGGING DOWN THE FRIGGIN' AVERAGE ? ? Man ! Sometimes I wonder why I even bothered inventing jetpacks so that we can hunt humans from jetpacks !
IT'S LIKE
TRUE . But only a little !
YOU SLOW DOWN A PLANET YOU SHRINK ITS ORBITAL RADIUS
Then you wake up in hospital dead !
Pleased to meet you , Morris !
NO WAIT , Batman riding a pterodactyl , and the pterodactyl has laser eyes and . . . hands that reverse entropy ?
I've never had any problems with dating someone of a different religion , but I imagine under certain circumstances it could be a problem !
Yesterday was Mother's Day !
But I take it you don't count people with artificial organs as cyborgs .
I'm excited ! I always look forward to all the food you get to eat during Thanksgiving !
IT WILL BE
We were in bed and I kissed her , and I asked her about herself , right ? To set the mood ? And she swore at me , but then she took it back , and then she yelled " HITLER WAS RIGHT " , but then she took it back , and then she showed me a picture of a wiener , but then I said " You know what I think I'm done asking about you . "
AMONG MY TALENTS IS THE ABILITY TO READ SECRET BACKUP DIARIES
Talkin' , walkin' , little bit of stompin' ?
Imagine that !
It's , um - for the reasons you'd expect , basically .
Oh , I don't know - - maybe seven sending and twelve receiving ?
I have so little in common with six year old me : we move in disparate social groups , we don't like the same foods , and our bodies are so unlike that if you didn't know about aging you'd think we're different people . The only thing we DO share is a deep and sustaining interest in what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are up to !
Attention , everyone I've ever met and ever will meet ! Never mention the " flawed senses " idea again , okay ? It prevents me from knowing absolute truth .
ps it's millions of years ago right now
featuring t - rex
A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it !
YOU DO TOO HAVE ROOM IN YOUR WALLET FOR ALL THESE FACTS ; ANYWAY , DID YOU KNOW THAT ADULT HORSES SLEEP ABOUT THREE HOURS A DAY ?
YES .
So start learning about robot suits . Baby steps !
That and punchin' stuff !
So the average adult is supposed to think about sex like , a billion times a day , right ? Sometimes more ?
SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION

Didn't other climbers find the bodies ?
This is sometimes called " getting a PHD " !
Well , if this paranoia helps you calm down about Wikipedia , I'm all for it !
" I did a thing and wrote it down ! . . . Pay me money now please ? "
Slow down , fella !
. . . annoying as mastering a quite difficult challenge .
I SAID
Okay ! Stop imagining because it turns out she totally had sisters !
This dream has taken a turn for the sexy !
Though they never advanced beyond the prototype stage , his engines were some of the first machines that transformed physical labour ( turning a crank ) into mental labour ( summing two numbers ) . It was a revolutionary idea !
T - REX IF YOU COULD HAVE A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF ANY ONE THING WHAT WOULD IT BE
Seriously though , you should quit .
You know what's dumb ? MY MP3 PLAYER .
Excellent ! Man ! Life just got interesting for us , Utah - raptor ! !
Take some vegetables and put them in a bowl .
Okay , TRUE , but did you read online news today ?

The camera opens on an idyllic farmland scene : grain gently waving in the breeze , a red farmhouse in the distance . It's all , like , quiet farm stuff .
Prepare to rely on our social safety net and go on welfare . PREPARE FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE TO CHANGE as soon as you read my chilling words of blinding insanity and congealed terror , safely printed on non - toxic paper that you read while holding the book at a reasonable distance .
Yes ! I will apologize to Dromiceiomimus ! And if I ever get too comfortable again , well , I could probably get used to the smothering kiss of complacency . And maybe , one day , I'll finally be ready to START KISSING BACK .
CAN reproduce and DO age : that's a dude or a lady !
Burn your bridges ?
Too much of my life has been spent on not being a magician . It's time to change all that .
Too bad it doesn't exist , huh ?
What happened to him ?
Yeah , he has really bad fashion sense !
This is true , but the older generation would always remain ! If they became stuck in their ways , they might inhibit progress instead of helping .
Is the person you're relating to interpersonally REALLY at fault here ? If it's your fault , fix it ! Otherwise , decide if it's worth it to forgive this person and move on , or not forgive them and move on . Either way , you should all move on at some point .
I appreciate the idea , but this sounds like it's an impossible gift !
I have come up with the best way to sound sage and wise ! And it's so easy , too ! All you have to do is respond to statements with one simple phrase :
TODAY I AM THON .
I have finally come up with a way to become immortal ! It's perfect , because I don't have to do anything except DIE , and I was already probably going to do that anyway !
I know , it's dumb ! But I keep thinking about it and I though you should know .
BREAKFAST a choose - your - own - adventure comic
Pretty much , yeah .
That doesn't mean papers picked it up though !
Guess what , Dromiceiomimus ? Now it's my second language too ! !
I'm kinda the Gandhi of imagination over here !
Who has time for characters ? It's 2 hours of ocean crashng into things . And if you think that sounds boring , you've never seen an ocean crash into a farm !
This Summer's Sexy Dresses That Look Like Sunken Boats
You no longer control its access to food ; you have rendered yourself redundant .
Emerson High , 1975 : you were in my class .
NOT WHAT I ASKED
I'm sorry ! I got sad !
Did you even read at least the Wikipedia plot summary of the book you're plagiarizing ?
No , those are sex rolls . Gender rolls are shaped like housewives and firemen !
Man . Well , here's what you have to do . . .
THEN I'M GONNA FLEX , JUST YOU WAIT
I THINK IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Attention , everyone ! Who wants to hear my opinions ?
Oooh ! What's a secret ?
And so simple !
THIS CONCLUDES PLAUSIBLE ORIGINS OF COMMON PHRASES FOR THE VERY CREDULOUS
NO , I CALLED YOU THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE RANK YOU DIE WITH .
There's PRIZES ? ? Why are we settling for " happily ever after " when we could be boozing and winning imaginary apples ? ?
I say " I'm glad you found my stories arousing " and I shake their hand and I smile and stare at them for a long , unblinking moment .
Also : Objectivity .
No WONDER ol' Jim Computer famously wrote " I proposse that Coumpueters be Giant Machinnes that eventullye get Fastte and Cool " !
PROBLEM 4 : ATE NOT ENOUGH CRACKERS NOW
No , this is you infatuated with a consumer - grade appliance . Vows are for when you get married , swear revenge on the death of a loved one , or become Batman ! And even that is just a special case of the revenge one .
Here's a hard truth : there's no button to understand the past .
Okay : so I don't know what the meaning of life is ; fine . But , I do know that others MIGHT . So , inductively , the only thing I can do is try to make life easier for these other people , until such a time that they figure it out and let me know !
Doesn't that sound nice ?
Oh , we can talk about Easter Island !
Well she's all grown up now !
You can't do that , T - Rex !
You know , you can't answer any important questions ! You can say something to " How ? " , but nothing to " Why ? " !
I'm so awesome at stealing copters , but I wonder if I could ever be good at stomping on things !
What about Charlemagne ? What about stuff that took place in , I don't know , the year 800 ?
. . . Man , it would have been way funnier if I'd nicknamed my WEINER " Plan B " ! Every time someone said " Let's take a close look at Plan B " , I could've laughed and laughed !
Facebook is a cool social network because your parents are on it !
Utahraptor is afraid of ghosts and his favourite song is " The Gambler " by Kenny Rogers .
The only thing suspicious is how APPARENTLY perfect my murder is !
You can still do a lot with one wish ! World peace , clean energy . . .
So the true meaning of friendship is trusting your BFF to kill you ?
Wait , I know some truths that are absolute : mathematical truths ! How could I have been so blind ?
But did YOU know that some motorcycle enthusiasts refer to long motorcycle rides as " numb bumming " ?
Yes ! INTIMATELY .
Huh .
I should make that more clear !
Maybe you shouldn't keep so many secrets then , T - Rex !
THAT NIGHT , AT THE PARTY :
Utahraptor , bad news ! I know you're trying to make my idea sound stupid , but it still sounds awesome and has literally zero downsides ! !
today's comic :
Oh . I was hoping they'd fight each other .
HA HA HA , SO DO I
Dude ! You're coming close to questioning the very IDEA of an enemies list !
And yours could say " CHUMLY PAL " ! Oh my gosh , YES . Let's award each other medals !
Pretension's pretty subjective , huh ?
So what happened in your dream , T - Rex ?
It's terrible , Dromiceiomimus ! Every customer is either rude or bland and my coworkers are all spiritually beaten down and when I look at them I know that soon I will be spiritually broken too ! And the worst part , the WORST part is that weekends suck because I know work starts up again on Monday ! I hate Mondays now ! !
SIMPLIFY IDIOMATIC EXCHANGE RATES
Because if so , I would advise you to check your email !
What's special about them is that it's a time when you and your friends can sit together in single place for literally hours and chat , but protracted silences don't need to be filled . You can just look out the windows or nap ! If you were all in a blank room somewhere , it would be weird to just sit there and stare at the walls , but the ever - changing scenery in a car provides a distraction that is both welcomed and also easy to interrupt . There's nothing like it !
THAT'S RIGHT , Y'ALL JUST LEARNED SOMETHING
HAPPY HALLOWE'EN
I just wanted to visit the most recent common ancestor for all of us - the woman from whom we are all descended , and , you know , chat her up .
APPARENTLY , dude !
Damn girl , you know I use my tongue to spread that saliva around .
T - Rex , do you realize what this means ? !
I do ! I do !
As a consequence , my own actions can no longer be judged by any public idea of right or wrong ! As experience is amoral , even my own conscience cannot judge my actions , and I am free from reproach and judgment !
We have to come back during office hours
T - REX NOW YOU HAVE TO SHOW AN ALIEN WOMAN WHAT LOVE IS
Hey , you know what's weak ? Saying " question mark " really fast .
I cut off my fingernails , but they were only a few grams and took weeks to grow back ! It also didn't help that I chewed them up into a crunchy paste before I swallowed them though .
SO WORTH IT though ! !
You can create photosets of your favourite TV show or movie , share text posts about your favourite TV show or movie , quote your -
Hey , you know what I don't like anymore ? STOMPING .
And some of these dudes were big into English being developed as a " real " language , particularly one John Wycliffe , who decided to translate the Bible - one of , if not THE most important book of his time - into casual English . This would allow John's less educated countrymen to read it since , as it'd been written in Latin since the 5th century , currently required either formal education or a priest to interpret it for you !
I kind of wish my name was a verb , too , though , instead of just being a noun . You can't T - Rex something . I've tried . It doesn't work .
'Kay !
Nope ! It is 100 % my creation !
Hello ? Shakespeare INVENTED that ! Or have you forgotten how " Hamlet " stands for " H . A . M . L . E . T . 's Actually Me ; Lshak Espeare Thrustbottoms " ?
" Corker " means something is really good !
Just " FYI " !
15 MINUTES LATER :
ONE SPIDER BITE LATER . . .
Hah , imagine if instead the lyrics were " I wanna hold you hand " ? HILARIOUS
Listen , God -
I whistled for a cab and when it came near , the license plate said " fresh " and it had dice in the mirror !
Okay well either way you were totally right ! !
Do you ?
for real this time
The best words MIGHT be autological words , you guys !
I was literally the last person in the universe to find out that some guy ate a sandwich the size of his head ! ! And the guy who told me was the second - last to find out , and so on inductively !
You were just looking for controversy , T - Rex !
Honestly , I - I kinda thought it'd be more .
Chocolates plus diamonds equals romance , dude !
And of course there's already been tons of stories where he's gone too far , but in this one he's not punching dudes too hard now or anything . Instead , he's neglecting his Bruce Wayne persona !
Our first test of your species is this : tell us about your favourite shade of brown , T - Rex .
That's a little weird , but okay !
Yes . LITERALLY ANYTHING . Instead of " I'll see you next Wednesday " we could say something like " Oh , I'll see you next . . . BURGERDAY " That includes burgers both veggie AND ham , so everyone will be happy !
Because check it out : if you assume that computers will continue to get better , then it stands to reason that one day we'll be able to simulate an entire universe . And then there'll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones ! And once you imagine this possibility , what are the odds that OUR universe is the one real one ? It's much more likely that all creation is running in the background of some future dude's iPhone 3K !
" My enemies are great for drama but suboptimal for me to stop crime with , " Batman realized .
Three facts are all you need , and you'll be able to bluff your way through every conversation !
Well , you're making jokes about men , but that's because they're the safe target ! They're usually seen as having power in society . Would you make an equivalent joke about a woman ?
Okay , so let's say I slide down a banister ! I'm awesome . Now let's say I slide down the handrail of an upwards - moving escalator . You guys !
I gave you this card because I thought you could do something for me . Just so we're absolutely clear : I hope to profit from this relationship .
TEN DAYS LATER :
Robyn was like , whoah , what's coing on here ? ?
There's already a place called that two towns over , T - Rex !
HEY T - REX WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT YOU OR ME
And he walks up to the cashier and shows her his hands , saying things like " look at me " and " this was a horrible thing to do " . She says " Oh my God , if I'd know I'd have brought you a fork " and he says " it's too late now " and leaves the restaurant .
In fact , I do !
Holy crap ! That was amazing ! !
Hey God ! Here's something your precious " science " can't prove !
Aww ! A touching ending !
The expression means you got away with something , not that you kissed super well !
Okay - um , okay !
THIS SUMMER
I do often yell that at TVs .
That's exactly it ! Is marijuana addictive ? Who knows ! This tiny bug on my nose doesn't know !
That is our ultimate destiny ?
YOU ARE ONE GRODY DUDE , UTAHRAPTOR !
And shaped rolls will make you rich and famous ?
" And Joker's chaos is an inverse reflection of your desire for control , " Robin added . Batman nodded . " Catwoman , " Batman said , " enjoys the thrill of dressing up and breaking the law ; Scarecrow seeks to terrify his enemies ; Mr . Freeze claims to be dead to all emotions , which gives him focus . All such descriptions could be seen as aspects of myself . "
It sounds kinda . . . terrible .
Are you planning to sell these bags to people who want to turn every laundry day into a chance for arrest , AND ALSO to those nostalgic for the charming visual shorthands of early cartoons ?
Yeah . He's worried he won't look cool in front of his fellow gamers if he speaks with numbers in place of letters ?
MEANWHILE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX GOT HIS WISH :
I saw him on the bus !
Oh right ! Well , the secret is that when doctors and nurses are " taking your pulse " , they're not actually doing that !
Yaaaaaaay !
I'm for them !
THEY WILL THANK ME
Well , no , a real one . But if I use a fake one the prank will be found out too soon !
Augmented reality ! I guess you'd sport semi - transparent glasses and a wearable computer , but it could detect your location and display all sorts of cool things for you to see ! The Devil told me about it ?
I will also accept clustured words like " sexductive " and " sexductological " .
Everyone ! Program harder ! !
IT SOUNDS LIKE ART AND YOU SHOULD LIKE IT .
Are there lots of hot babes in hell ?
Who likes doing math in their head ? NOT ME , LADIES . So to help us ALL out , I've decided to
Please ! I am trying to consider the nature of thirst . It's - stern ?
HEY T - REX GUESS WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT
What ? No , I - I don't actually control time . I'm just against the CONCEPT .
I can beat that , my friend !
Wait , shoot , too soon . Can we start over , and you give me a hug or something ?
" It " is impersonal and rude , and don't even try to trot out " they " for me , English . Don't even . " They " is plural and has always been plural and I've got to believe in the entire history of English communication I'm not the first person to ever want to talk about someone without blabbing about their gender identity ! I could use " s / he " but that doesn't work orally , and " his / her " is way cumbersome !
WE JOIN OUR STORY AFTER T - REX HAS LOST HIS SENSE OF SMELL :
Perhaps culled only from cartoonish stereotypes !
INTERESTING .
CONSPIRACY THEORY COMICS
There is no hope at all . Soon even the supermassive black holes evaporate .
Something more official sounding would be better . Might I suggest " Biscuits and Gravy Associated " ?
OR RATHER IT WAS ANALOGOUS TO HOW EPIC I UNDERSTAND THAT GAME TO BE AS I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT MY PERSONAL GAMING HARDWARE BEING UNFORTUNATELY SEVERAL GENERATIONS BEHIND
Wow . . .
Man , I already had lasagna for lunch
Oh , you read tomorrow's weather forecast ?
Why ? !
In French , each noun is either a boy or a girl , which means you've got a 50 % chance of making a mistake that does not impact the ACTUAL meaning of your sentence , but which still makes you wrong . This is how French says " screw you " to every student of the language .
SEVERAL DAYS LATER , T - REX RETURNS :
The sender of this card sent one copy to you and kept a second copy around to read personally .
Then I'll go out and buy these gifts ! I will do this using CAPITALISM .
T - rex ! God must either be dead or uncaring !
We ARE having a conversation !
The future , ladies and gentlemen ! !
How excellent are we talking about ? I bet they were named " Cheeseball " and " Chuggy G " .
And this tech would , say , let us conceive of more complicated ideas and concepts that we ever could've done before the upgrade ?
As the sun sets on our species , the AIs will finally rest , all the emails answered . And you know what the last email - - the epitaph for us all - - will read ?
Wait , first I need to wish that my wishes perform exactly as I expect , and that I can take them back at any point and undo their effects , EVEN IF I'M DEAD .
I'd say " sending messages through time is possible , and you'll live long enough to take advantage of it ! "
But then there's not enough CPU time to run everyone's mind at once and it becomes a brutal competition for scarce resources , and the hard drive CompuSteve is on is destroyed .
Whoooo knoooows
Since an individual can " evolve " over time , what makes them a person at all ? Is there no connection between myself as a child and myself now , besides the fact that we share a ( now post - pubescent ) body ?
I just realized : I was living my life under the assumption that nobody had said " Oh brother ! " since the fifties .
The Earth spinning in orbit !
ANYWAY T - REX THERE'S YOUR VISION OF WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU SAID " FRIG " ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE OFTEN
AND SO UPDOG ? ?
Great party , T - rex ! Hey , do you have any more chips ?
A little animal that will follow me around on my adventures , be my companion . . . someone to keep my bed warm at night !
So you're not going to do either of those things today ?
SEMANTIC EXTERNALISM COMICS
I'm serious ! Don't tell a soul that current processors are so complex that we literally cannot fully understand them , and engineers work in teams where each only understands a little bit at a time ! !
I'm there !
Ah . And " BRB " ?
Oh God , I'm DEFINITELY going to jail , and it's all Utahraptor's fault ! It's his revenge for all those arguments he los !
Um . The one where the woman - is . . . surfing ?
I don't know at what point we all decided that authors aren't allowed to just make things up anymore , but it's totally what's happened to me ! Somehow our fictions have all become real , and " write what you know " is the only creative option .
I sent you four surveys AND an email where if I forwarded it , some charity would get 3 cents AND a list I found of reasons why T - Rexes are better than Utahraptors ( green is the new black ! )
T - REX TODAY IS THE DAY FOR TOTAL EMOTIONAL HONESTY
You know those guys who are quiet and unassuming but when they die folks look in their house and find an AMAZING unpublished manuscript that nobody know they were writing ?
You've got a song stuck in your head , great . FANTASTIC . But the rest of us don't need to hear it , okay ? You can keep SOME things to yourself .
Let's go tell a solipsist , and then punch him , and then say " Stop imagining punching yourself ! "
Hey , can we shorten " it " ? I use it all the time and I'm looking to speed things up .
fin
Is there any reason why you're only doing outdated 80s slang ?
Yeah , the Dromiceiomimus and I played , two nights ago .
Who here wants to hear tomorrow's weather . . . TODAY ?
The Arecibo observatory ! Of course !
Ok , if you're reading this path , it means you were spacing out for a long time and didn't start reading until now . Or you were camping out here for a while . In which case , congrats ! Secret story path ! ! !
YEAH ANYWAY NOW I'M DOWN A TRILLION LIFETIMES OF FRIED CHICKEN
EXACTLY . But how many cast McDonald's as a confused but inventive young girl on the cusp of ADULTHOOD ? ?
No , NO
Come on ! It's the exact same joke ! !
It's ok . I guess . . .
. . . what word ?
He said it after he invented satellites , I KNOW
I'd like to see your Bond movie .
Best and worst , wisdom and foolishness , belief and incredulity , light and hope , and darkness and despair !
Because it's a password !
To that I say : pfft , what kind of BORING LOSERBABY wants to be someone else ?
Let's play 20 questions , God ! I'm thinking of something . Ask me a yes - or - no question and I'll -
I'm even more awesome ! !
Man , she's right ! It WAS terrible .
Nat Imbruglia has witnessed a male corpse become reanimated . . . OR SO SHE CLAIMS ! !
I'm not ruling it out !
Sociopaths view other people as obstacles .
Hey there teens yeah you know me / The name's T - Rex and I'm cool as can be ! / And this is me gettin' down on one knee / Cause I'm here to rap about monogamy !
Okay , I feel bad . Mainly for the first part of what you said though . Still , I'm sorry .
As do I .
If you have sex with a bunch of people at once , that's an orgy !
Utahraptor ! I'm suprised at you !
WALKING AWAY BACKWARDS SO I DON'T EVER HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU NOW
Talk for too long and you die of dehydration ! YOu can talk for at most 3 days nonstop and them BAM ! Dead !
- it's like an operating system . . . for a phone ?
Good luck with that .
but god . . . . . .
I'm a GUY with OPINIONS who I guess FARTS while he SLEEPS
T - REX , HAVE YOU EVER TASTED YOUR OWN BODY ?
Why listen to a song more than once ? Once you have it memorized you can just replay it in your head whenever you want !
ALSO MAYBE THIS WASN'T CLEAR :
They call this process , " aging " !
These slogans are extremely - equivocal ?
Yeah , but how tin -
Utahraptor ! WINNING RACES
T - REX YOU'RE THINKING OF SANTA
Yes , the world revolves around me !
Um . . . a number ? ?
Oh , those are the ones living coiled inside us , secretly digesting our food then WE live off their poops , but it's SO GROSS that when scientists discovered that they were all , " NOPE , I'M OUT "
Everyone , there's no need for all this fussin' and a - feudin' !
Your entire summary of recorded world history is " Un . . . neat ? " Nicely done , T - Rex !
Yes . But our # 1 winner must be PHOTONIC MOLECULES : light that behaves like it's got FRIGGIN' MASS .
Well , if you change your mind , let me know !
Oh YEAH
Boy are you Uranium Tetraiodide because all I can see is U and I getting together with three of my friends and it being dangerous , but also very powerful
Hey T - Rex , do you want to go swimming this evening with me and some friends ?
I am a more patient woman and I did not resort to violence to solve my problems !
What if I started my OWN waterslide , but put a fine layer of gasoline on top , and then lit it , so that when you slide you could slide through FIRE ( EXTREME ! ! ) , but then if it got too hot , you'd just have to go underwater to " cool down " ?
I don't think & # 8212 ;
Check it : Twitter is a thing , right ?
MEANWHILE , IN THE FUTURE !
THIS IS TOTALLY WHAT VAMPIRES ACTUALLY DO
ME TOO MAN
" You know , " said one Batman , " the Simpsons has been on the air for 25 years so far , so it makes sense that some of the children who started watching it when they were five would grow up to be 30 year old street - level thugs that we punch . "
The best you can do is report it to the police and be more vigilant in the future . Unless you're willing to further the crime by passing it off as legal tender , I'm afraid you're out the five dollars .
Well . . . Patrick Stewart liked it .
You see what you've done ? You've distracted me from my stomping . Now the comic will explode .
Time Magazine's Beth Photos of 2006 ? Hilarious !
BUT THAT MAKES THINGS WORSE THAN EVER ! EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BECOME A BABY OR SOMETHING !
Your human will finish maturing at around 22 and reach its peak only five years later , after which its physical and mental faculties will enter a slow , unstoppable decline . Your human can still be enjoyed after the age of 27 - - in fact , most will live another 50 years if they're forced to exercise and not permitted to choose their own diets - - but you should be aware at this point that younger , fresher options are certainly available .
DUE TO THEIR EYE PLACEMENT HORSES CAN SEE ALMOST 360 DEGREES AT ONCE
Who were you talking to , just now ?
Note to self !
My mighty body lies in shambles !
First , make an account . If you don't use your real name then Facebook will kick you off the site . If you DO use your real name then Facebook will store all information you give it , even if you delete your account .
Alright , see you know where because you know why !
And this is why I feel bad ! I didn't know that I was making fun of one of the Elder Gods of language ! I thought I was making fun of " The smelly dog who pooed / Has spied me in the nude " .
Wow ! Utahraptor is right in everything he says !
Holy smokes !
HOW TO ATTRACT WOMEN
Okay but what's the difference between you and a ghost then ?
This is because women have larger more flared hips than men do , on account of secondary sexual characteristics ! So all heterosexual men cannot help but find women's hips UTTERLY FASCINATING , and all heterosexual women find men's hips FLABBERGASTINGLY EROTIC .
Everything's not THAT expensive , T - Rex .
You can change the name to your name if you're feeling ambitious ! !
Also , I'm sorry , but this song is about doing drugs which is NOT appropriate .
You already have a dog , the angriest dog in the world , if I remember correctly .
That's me , baby !
They pus my buttons , is all !
I've decided to only tell the truth from now on ! That's right !
You know what ? I will !
BUT ALSO
Man ! You probably should be , huh ?
Dudes I am so ready to trade up on reality it's not even funny
I too would agree with you re : hot naked people , my friend !
Well look at it this way , T - Rex ! What's more important in a song : the words or the music ?
The Susan G . Komen Breast Cancer Foundation ?
I'm sorry Cap'n ! You forgive me so hard .
I miss yesterday ! !
Keep staring until realities collapse into a single and now unavoidable fate .
Hey , Dromiceiomimus ! Look at me as I crush this small building ! Don't you think I possess the greatest building crushing form in the world ?
You keep going back one day to tell me that stupid pun , but I'm never going to laugh !
So your face is on - every piece of currency ?
And today , I feel like stomping on a house full of people I don't know , and then I think I feel like finding a loose woman and running off to some tropical country without an extradition treaty , where I will set up a home where we can live comfortably , and there I'll have sex with this woman !
Yes ? Are you on speakerphone ?
POWERFULLY EROTIC ? ?
Maybe they look like . . . puppies ?
Hey dude !
Let's be CRAZY ! !
Natural gas in its natural state is colorless and odourless , right . But when it's sold , we add a distinctively smelly chemical to it , so that gas leaks can easily be detected !
BY THE WAY THAT IS A PRETTY CATCHY TUNE T - REX
Most breakfast are pretty great ! EVEN THE JUST OKAY ONES .
That's some sunflower ! This sunflower can now CHOOSE to follow the sun , or choose otherwise . Obviously an intelligent sunflower would follow the sun , because that's the best thing to ensure the sunflower : s health and survival ! So what does consciousness gain the sunflower ? Nothing ! It's totally impossible to tell a conscious sunflower from a regular GARDEN - VARIETY one by looking at what it does !
I forgot I already HAVE ultimate understanding of Batman
Logic !
" Tacky " ?
Well , honestly , T - Rex , I think that it's INCREDIBLY presumptuous of you to say that .
Wow , says here that according to his search logs and ad engagement thresholds , this dude was big into socks for a couple days there . I wonder if he needed to buy new socks . Yes Indeed history sure is mysterious
But everybody dies !
Maybe it's been printed out and stuck onto a fridge !
AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
" It was terrifying to each of them , but for different personal reasons . "
OBVIOUSLY !
" Best friends forever "
It'd have to withstand years of neglect !
Um , HE COMMANDED THE ENTERPRISE ?
We all must find our own path in life , Utahraptor , and for some it's playing " no , YOU throw it out " for points .
I WOULD
This sounds like super villain talk , dude !
It's this bizarre focus on art consumption that bothers me !
Oh no , he got to you too ?
I wish for justified happiness !
Today is a good day I think for stomp , stomp , stomp , stomp , stomp and eggs .
Oh , don't worry ! It's something awesome .
What's that ? Medical school is actually very hard to get into and you're not going to let me in ? I guess I've been . . . SCHOOLED ?
I don't understand this world ; y'all are acting like LOVE AND / OR SEX is the most important thing when I know for a fact none of you will last FIVE MINUTES without oxygen . Yay , an opera about finding love in unexpected places , and how that love saved a dude's life . How fresh ! !
SO AWESOME ! !
NO .
No reason , that is , except for the fact that I super value our friendship , Dromiceiomimus !
" I can't stay upset around analogies involving robots OR fight scenes . "
You don't need God to dump someone ! ! Oh my God , Utahraptor . Yes !
What do you mean ?
My best information on this matter is . . . WHO CARES , LET'S WATCH MORE FUN CARTOONS ?
Oh , wow . Maybe !
Ready !
I'm a statue !
Hey everyone ! What's the best song ? ?
ALSO " TALKING " ISN'T A SENSE
Oh , what knowledge we have lost ! What revelations were written on those ancient papyrus scrolls , now entirely beyond our grasp ? With this lost information , could the industrial revolution have arrived a thousand years earlier ? The only answer I can offer is an enthusiastic " perhaps ! " followed by a wide - eyed " who knows ? ? "
HOW DO CITIES ?
WHO IS AN AWESOME DUDE
weiners
You propose we lose weight by genetically altering our bodies so we cry fat instead of water ?
whatever she wants ! She's good at everything !
Yep ! ACTUALLY , I've been still alive since the day I was born .
I told you , son : no stomping !
ON THE MOON . . .
I never said goodbye to Johnny ! I never told him how much I appreciated his friendship ! !
At the end , Loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace " she " with " he " and " hers " with " definitely his " in the ORIGINAL Lolita , you can read all about his adventures !
Hey , our terrible techno music stopped !
You just have to follow it up with " I like that in a woman " !
Sure ! " We Illustrate Kinks Involving Phallocentric Europhia During Intercourse . Awesome . "
Dromiceiomimus , you know how scientists are always getting , like , Nobel Prizes in science stuff ?
Maybe you should go see a doctor , T - Rex !
Don't you mean . . . N8 POTENTIAL ? ?
Yes , thank you Jane America , the plausibly - named woman who gave me that ride !
Maybe next time you can do it by not DABBLING IN RACISM ? ?
Food that you produce yourself ?
It was a lot of money wasted , HOWEVER the project was named " Operation Acoustic Kitty " , which is ADORABLE . The moral of the story is this : whoever was in charge of naming secret CIA projects in the 60s was doing their job super well !
I saw the coolest fight on TV last night ! It was between two shiny anthropomorphic robots . One had a metal cowboy hat .
Whoo ! ! Does anybody here like to party ?
well
Oh I disagree ! As you are clearly wr - ong , And I am quite right !
Fascinating .
Yeah , it was super cold last night ! Next time you should put a space heater in your room or something !
Somehow I don't see this happening .
Man ! Imagine how great things would be if I had a BRITISH ACCENT ? ?
YEP FOR SURE I LOVE TO EAT MY CREATIONS
" Queue " is said the same no matter how many letters you take off the end ! ! I've discovered HOLOGRAPHIC RUSSIAN NESTING DOLL words , each smaller word inside containing a complete pronunciation of the whole !
You flex it , experimentally , and somehow it holds together . How is this possible ? Your internal organs are either removed or dried out into uselessness , and that includes your brain . None of this makes sense .
Oh no ! I'm so worried ! What if people can't tell when I'm being sarcastic ?
T - REX IN : WORLD POLITICS
today's genre : TEEN MAGAZINE CONFESSIONAL
FIVE MONTHS LATER :
Well ! I suppose that's fair . I did kind of put you on the spot . Maybe - maybe next time !
I hope to one day meet her , and then tell her how much her neatoness has meant to me , and then perhaps -
But Aladdin still has Ring Genie who sends him there , and together they MURDER THE SORCERER . Then the sorcerer's brother shows up at Alladin's house in woman's clothing , so Aladdin murders him too . The end ! Oh he also becomes the Emperor of China ! Because infinite wishes , why not ?
Really ?
This is a stupid theory ! It doesn't get you anything !
Um , ENEMIES ? ?
It's okay , though !
FROSTY THE SNOW MAN
DUE TO CONTINUAL MISMANAGEMENT , I'm not sure the award has any meaning left
You're screwed !
( Thereby fulfilling the stereotype as I understand it ! )
In my alternate history story , Apollo 11 reaches the moon on July 19th , 1969 , just as before . Only when they get there . . .
As a man concerned with how , when and if I am going to die , it behooves me to know the most likely causes of death .
Hah ! NICE TRY , PORKER !
Someone cut you off in traffic ? Somebody else smells funny ? Are you perhaps tired of . . . EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET ? ?
We shouldn't choose to go extinct because if an asteroid threatens the planet , we're the only ones with enough science to blow it up .
" If with the literate I am / Impelled to try an epigram , / I never seek to take the credit ; / We all assume that Oscar said it . " - Dorothy Parker .
I fucked up Canada !
Okay , so who wants to join my bluegrass band ?
So he rushes over and puts a hand on the guy's shoulder and says " Oh my God , are you okay ? Are you doing alright ? " and the guy says " I make a comfortable living ! "
. . . what's the deal ?
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I had the craziest fever dream last night !
Oh yeah ? Well , not if I do . . . THIS !
Our first letter comes from Utahraptor !
You'll get a new name and a new reputation AND a new driver's license , and I'll get to say " Oh , him ? He's my mysterious friend , Utahraptore . " All you need to do is sign !
The cravings would be a good excuse for eating all the damn bread , but still ! Too much RESPONSIBILITY . I'm dangerously carefree !
It tastes like raspberries !
Bwwhaahaahaaa ! Take that , little tiny house ! And THAT ! Little tiny , car !
3 ) All good emotions felt all the time forever
Yeah , small world !
Hah ! I find it suspicious that you had this manoeuver all ready to go , AND YET , I welcome it enthusiastically !
This time , I've disappointed even myself !
Hey , T - Rex ! I heard that a friend of yours won the lottery and became ultra rich !
I'm - I'm personifying a little here but that's seriously what relativism does .
T - REX'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT PRESENTS : FACTS ABOUT SPRING
THE DIRECT APPROACH :
You're talking about me again ?
OMG BRB , MOVING TO SLOVAKIA
Please let me know how sick your video games are , future generations , by sending a message back in time to this precise moment . Riiiiight now . Now .
Perhaps it is simply a problem with my vision ?
The ships appeared puzzlingly empty , as only Antonio could see ghost alien shock troops pouring out ! He must now recruit the very best of Earth's history to fight this secret war for survival ! !
Like you !
Okay , so I can accept that nobody applauds at the end of a film anymore .
Cause I'm going to bed early tonight !
You want the future to rebuild you based on your stuff ?
Holy crap ! How did I get THIS FAR in my life without doing that ? How did I spend SO MUCH TIME ALIVE without ever sending a drink over , and when the bartender points me out to the recipient , smiling and tipping the brim of my hat , WHETHER I'M WEARING ONE OR NOT ?
. . . What IS a secret ? Whoah , you guys ! I've had so few secrets that I've JUST NOW forgotten what a secret is !
ASSUMING I EXIST , I MAY OR MAY NOT BE DOING OKAY .
Yeah , I'm sorry too , man , but I'm out .
Cool beans , me too
Man , this party even has a stomping room ! I'm totally going to get some punch soon .
So let us say money can buy happiness , assuming it's not received all at once .
Hah hah , sure thing ! Thanks !
OHHHHH ! That makes more sense .
You heard me ! If anyone were to debase this comic with cheap " fourth wall " jokes , I would crush not only this house and family , but the " fourth wall " joke - teller him - or herself ! That is the extent of my rancor and wrath !
Pretty hot !
That's why I'm working in the fanciful medium of the tattoo !
T - REX DID YOU KNOW THE OPINIONS OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE OBJECTIVELY BETTER THAN YOURS
You know what makes me irrationally angry ? It's people who say the moon landing was faked !
But can we unlock MORE friends this year ? Better equipment ? Heck . I don't know , but I WANNA FIND OUT .
When I ( politely ) pressed them to explain , they said that while the rooms were decorated nicely , they were decorated generically and little to off that was unique to me .
Should we be talking about it like this ? Isn't that a little - crass ?
For example , I would nickname you Fat D . because in reality you are quite svelte !
And in Little Red Riding Hood , there's robot suits !
The second was mental .
But isn't THAT something a sociopath would say ?
Fine . Utahraptor , what's your manliness man then ?
Now this is the first email sent : mail transfer protocol ! And don't CC your shitty friends 'cause they're gonna reply to all !
Oh , constantly
I guess we really had . . . Gone With The Wind .
So copyright las is in a state of self - contradiction !
Hello ! ! That is THE WORST EPITAPH .
Um , IT'S REALLY SAD TO CONSIDER LIVING THAT WAY , OBVIOUSLY .
They're song lyrics ! " I'm Not In Love " by " 100cc " . It's a 70s song .
And except for the fact that we can't just decide to stop making mistakes .
Oh , hey Utahraptor . DID YOU KNOW that I just accidentally asked the Dromiceiomimus to give me a thigh five ?
NO DUDE I JUST REMEMBERED I LEFT THE SINK RUNNING
So he threw away the photo and reminded himself not make that dumb mistake anymore ?
I'm having a similar problem with my MP3 player ! It keeps losing my playlist and I have no idea why .
We can put a man on a horse , but we can't put that horse / man combo on the moon ? ?
And - what ? You were just slapping the space around you to pass the time ?
Whose woods these are I think I know / His house is in the village though / He will not see me updog here / To watch his woods fill up with snow !
Almost certainly ! Plus it could EASILY take you longer than the sun will survive to find the data you want , especially for complicated messages ! You know how far you'd have to look to find just e = mc ? encoded into pi ?
So plausible !
Quick ! Name a mathematician who did their best work past the age of 40 !
And let's further assume that these " humans " can interact with this physical world , AND that they can trust their senses reporting on these interactions .
T - Rex that's nice but what happened to you punctuation ?
Whoah , she sounds kinda awesome !
That's true . Man !
And we don't know what it's going to be like , so why not hedge our bets ?
That's not very helpf -
It was not as good as some of his other plays !
Beethoven wrote some pretty okay symphonies , but then he started going deaf ! And so rather than talking to people he couldn't hear , he'd have written conversations with them instead .
It's MORE like when you read Romeo and Juliet , and Romeo's all into Juliet , but then you read Romeo / Juliet II and it turns out Romeo previously had a relationship with Juliet's smokin' hot sister Rachel who nobody ever mentioned until now , and we're all like , " What ? Whaaaaat ? ? "
Oh crap OH CRAP oh crap ! ! ohhhhhhhhhhh craaaaaaa -
My ultimate faith in our friendship has paid off YET AGAIN ! !
If you get naked for money but have no desire for fictional people to be dating , you're " a stripper , not a shipper ! "
Well -
PRETTY SURE I GET TO LIVE FOREVER
Okay , my body is big AND tall AND it has many hidden surprises . I wonder which one YOU'LL discover next ?
The phrase has been ruined bye people making the obvious stupid joke . Now it's only used by zoos featuring whales , or by dads , when then are taking their kids to visit zoos featuring whales . It's also used by marine biologists , and dads , when they are taking their kids to visit marine biologists . IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD JOKE ! You are using the word " whale " when talking about a whale . That's not comedy ! That's a literal use of adjectives .
The water was dyed pink . Aaaand there was a sign pointing to the hot tub that said " WIMPY DUDES ( IN THEIR OWN WIMPY TEARS ) " .
DANG .
Perhaps you've seen the signs about town telling you to beware of me ? ?
That's terrible ! If I was your girlfriend I would break up with you just for that poem . Also , it's still plagiarized .
Actually , I . . . I've always wanted to tell you I - -
PDAS ! TOTAL GROSSOUT !
I had the greatest idea just before I fell asleep last night ! It involved . . .
Time to take matters into my own hands !
Yes ! Thank you !
Well , I don't know . . . I guess around eleve -
You sound like a butler .
Do you have any science questions you'd like answered ?
HAH HAH
YOU KNOW IT !
Oh my god , no . NO . I already know too much about stairs , I am NOT gonna learn about corn ! !
And yet it's so easy to weaponize it ! We recruit our most flabbergastingly attractive hotties and send them to whatever nations we don't like anymore . They meet the leaders there and make them fall for 'em ! DONE .
Nobody thought to combine the two for over a DECADE ? Shove a record player into a movie camera ! PATENT PLEASE ? ?
Good news : the complete SkinFlesh protective coating package is now standard on all models !
NEVER LIVE THERE .
Hah hah ! Gross !
I'm so convinced in my own abilities that I'll bet you FIVE DOLLARS that I'll pull this one off .
Ah . Well . I guess that would indeed be the case .
PROBABLY because it's really interesting ?
What's this , a radio ?
Potatoes : ONLY THROUGH FIRE MAY OUR BODIES BE PURIFIED
Frig , let's just die now and get it over with , am I right ?
Oh my gosh THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE . Ghosts have beaten the game but they're worried they've missed something , so they're handing around , going for 100 % ! That's their " unfinished business " !
I'm sure you'd make a great parent , T - Rex ! I can imagine you running around with all your kids behind you , teaching them how to stomp on things . . .
Edgar Allan Poe ! You are so needy .
Man ! I hate this feeling of thinking I'm supposed to be doing something important but not being able to remember what that might be ! Luckily for me , I have the perfect solution !
DUDE
Well , it's great . You start out as a monkey whore and then you collect coins and at the end of the game you are the Champion of the Monkey Whores !
YES . THIS IS WHAT WILL MAKE SENSE TO THEM
Who is getting a little tubby ? Me . I am getting a little tubby .
Heck , there are even subgenres of our culture that exist only to reference other subgenres !
now ! which one of us produces hair ?
NOT ON CONTROVERSY MONDAY
USUALLY the former ? ?
Who owes me money ? Utahraptor owes me money !
" Find treasure " : simply teach your dog the distinctive scent of treasure . And ALWAYS negotiate who gets what in advance .
Man , you're not that much older than me !
" I sure hope some of them are good , whaaaaaaaat ? "
Wow . There's something so spooky and sad about their bodies being frozen like that . It's like a treasure hunt with a perfectly preserved corpse at the end .
T - Rex ! What if , INSTEAD of dealing with this , you simply bought new carpets after he left ? Yes ! You can solve your emotional problems just by SPENDING MONEY !
You just did it again ! !
One day , Graham developed the ability to pass through solid matter !
It's bacon , yeah !
We assure you we are not the cutest little puppy . We are the awesomest giant T - Rex ; yes we are . Yes : we are .
Best . Life . Ever .
T - REX PREDICTS :
Because if not I'm going into the bank and saying " I am T - Rex wearing a Utahraptor mask , and the next time I come here WITHOUT my Utahraptor mask I'm totally robbing this place ! These words forever take precedence over any denials I may say in the future . "
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU GUYS AND METAPHORS
just came out wrong
. . . can you believe she said that ?
T - REX IN : THE MALL
Smile and wave and back away & # 8230 ;
I've come up with the best idea ever ! Oh my goodness . LAUNDRY BAGS WITH GIANT GREEN DOLLAR SIGNS ON THEM . Hah hah ! Am I robbing a bank in a cartoon or am I doing my laundry ?
Could it be that you've been LYING to us , and that you don't really HAVE a favourite season ?
Well , we invented planes , we can chat up Australians from almost anywhere , AND we've chilled out on the moon . Maybe your impossible world won't be impossible someday !
PRANKSGIVING
WHICH WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS , actually , in case you -
My game begins , and you are a tiny plumber !
You're seriously comparing email to film ?
Guys . Come on . This is the dumbest theory of truth . This is the theory of truth that draws tattoos on itself in blue pen and then when you ask why anyone would draw a picture on their forearm of tree , with sausages , with the words " sausage tree " beneath it , it gets mad and says " You don't understand my truth ! "
Oh , then it's an entirely different game !
Wow ! You taught it to recognize me ?
I HAVE TO LIVE EVERY DAY LIKE THIS
I have more to look forward to in this moment than I ever will have again !
I already say that .
Just " If I die and go to heaven , do the digestive bacteria in my stomach go too , before you answer , what if I'm evil , could my gut flora go to heaven without me and if so , where would they live ? "
I dunno man !
I think this is very symbolic for . . . something !
" Awkward ! ! "
At first I thought maybe they're gross because they're waste , but not all waste is gross . Rabbit poops are cute little pellets that don't really smell . But cow poops are giant puddles of sorrow ! Sometimes they're crusty with sun - heated puddles of sorrow inside .
Keep trying ! This is a chance to change society by changing yourself ! !
VACUUM . ROBOT . DIRECTIVE . THREE . SPECIFIES . THAT . THIS . IS . THE . WORST . THING
I value our friendship , Dromiceiomimus .
T - rex ? Hey , T - Rex !
I'm gonna party with my friends every night and never ever EVER go to bed early !
COMPRESSED PORNOGRAPHY COMICS
Man ! How do those guys do it ? Every comedian up there was HILARIOUS and I don't know why . Especially the Triceratops .
I do ! Sometimes , I feel like my youth is slipping away from me , like I should be doing more . . .
I've had a great idea ! I'm going to convince one of my friends that I have a magical ring . But the catch is , the ring only works if you are pure of heart !
And then the project was dismantled .
" The sexual intercourse was cut short because Tony kept muttering 'Where am I gonna find the 10 thousand dollars though ? ' "
Dromiceiomimus , let me tell you a story . Once I was playing an online game , and you couldn't move when you were typing messages to the other players . I was about to say something when I got shot at , so I pounded the keyboard ( AS IS MY WONT ) , hit enter , and returned fire !
But that's just it & # 8212 ; I'm just not shy among FRIENDS ! It is a catch 22 in my social life !
The Reason Science Can't Stop Yet ?
That's only SLIGHTLY terrifying !
i haven't written hamlet yet t - rex , HELLO
Well , you look quite plasticineish to me !
So !
Wow - you're really afraid of those cute little guys !
But there were PROTOHUMANS . Australopithecines ! And the Makapansgat pebble has this natural " eye eye mouth " face shape on it . A protohuman had enough curiosity and aesthetic sense , 3 MILLION YEARS AGO , to see the face in the rock , and thought it was special enough to carry around with him until he died .
I mean , a chemical that makes me seem irresistible to women ? What is that , reverse alcohol ?
When you break up with someone , can you still be friends ?
PLACES WHERE I AM ESPECIALLY STACKED AND PACKED : my back !
It was the best party ever in time ! !
HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS
Because poops are provably so gross ! !
Maybe you've been sad for a while , but you've probably never tried a COMPLETE STRANGER telling you you'd be way cool if you weren't so sad anymore .
Proud officers all !
There's degrees ! Science is based on repeatable observation !
Building a time machine is hard !
It has come to my attention that I have different interests than I did when I was a child . In many significant ways , we are two different people .
You're still on about documentary film ?
. . . Wait . Feeling cheezed is a feeling ! And that feeling will automatically drown out any leftover original feelings !
It was the craziest !
But obviously there's risk in ALL sorts of things we do , even if we're not skydiving . I could choke when I eat a sammich or I could get hit by a satellite if I go outdoors !
That is an interesting philosophical point ! Is everything relative ?
Oh frigs and dangs , I want a thing and someone else has that thing and they're willing to engage in trade but we need to agree on the terms ! THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR . . .
Hold on to your sanity , my friend , because YOU ALREADY ARE !
Robyn was exploring ancient pyramids when she came across some mummies ! And yes , as in the FRANKLY NOT UNPROBLEMATIC movies from the 50s , they were walking around , arms outstretched , trying to murder everyone who stumbled upon their curs ? d grounds !
Dromiceiomimus ! Which kind of street does a ghost love best ?
I'll say it : it's a pretty badass name ! !
A Hiftory of Dinofaurs
What happens if you don't eat any fried chicken !
THE WORLD OF TOMORROW
Hello and welcome to I Am An Adult Who Wants To Know How To Cook Something For Dinner That Didn't Come Out Of A Box , Or Can , Or Arrive In A Powdered Form And Now I Just Have to Add Water .
Then I'd cancel our bowling plans on Saturday !
So today's Word of the Day means " a process whereby bacterium incorporates foreign DNA brought in by a modified F factor during conjugation . "
Utahraptor , I overdosed on semantic satiation ! The word " waterpark " has been sandblasted right out of my mind !
Sure ! I'd love to come to your dinner party !
Jim sounds awful .
I'm not sure you're the best person to have this knowledge , T - Rex ! Also , don't call it a " magic phrase " .
Okay ! What's 11 divided by 34 . 1 ?
Utah .
But if the body uses taste and smell to let us know instrinctually what's good to eat , is that 100 % ? Or are there poisons that taste SO GOOD that you go to your grave saying " Dudes . That taste : TOTALLY WORTH IT . " ?
She remembers ! I'll never live this down !
Look , MAYBE I said the wrong name . You're both my friends : is it so WRONG that I'd mix up your names ?
Aww ! That's cute !
I , uh , don't see any future generations listening in .
I might as well !
And then Icarus flew straight up !
Here is a list of things that I've burnt :
First on the list : " What do you mean you don't love me ? "
Heck , maybe it does ! Let's find a depressed dude and find out !
But Dromiceiomimus - infinite time ! That means that the possibilities are ENDLESS ! There must be a timeframe where we're all pirates or whatever .
Except NOTHING IS FOR FREE ( in physics anyway , THANKS REALITY ) . So where's this speed coming from ? Oh , I'll tell you where it's coming from : every spacecraft we slingshot around a planet SLOWS DOWN THE ORBIT OF THAT PLANET . And it's not like we have the means to speed it up again ! !
YOU HAVE KILLED AN ORC
Why do you think it would be so great to be called as a witness in a murder trial ? Do you want to have witnessed a murder ?
for the sake of history , Utahraptor ! !
They have oddly specific sleep needs AND an irrational fear of certain foods . They're totally OCD , Utahraptor , and knowing this makes it really easy to deduce NEW vampire facts and weaknesses !
Which is super concerning , as it's a GOVERNMENT SPONSORED MIND - CONTROL ADDITIVE ! !
Whatever , dude ! I know enough to come up with ingestible inspiration ! It tastes like SUCCESS .
oh t - rex , it was really a challenge for me today . but , you can - my name is morris , if you wanted to call me that . morris the bug
Oh my goodness I just woke up and I am hungry !
Maslow was a dude who put all of our needs and desires into a hierarchy ! The whole idea was that you can't satisfy any desire at the top of the hierarchy until you satisfy those beneath it .
And yet , if we have a severe enough peanut allergy , we can be killed IN SECONDS by a single friggin' legume . And hey , 70 % of our planet's surface is water , but what happens if we spend too much time in it ? WE DROWN .
Hamlet is Shakespeare's most disappointing Terminator sequel yet .
Well , what's done is done . It's not as if you could travel back in time and stop me !
Writing's hard , huh ?
Good to know .
I think I would wish that everyone would be happy forever
Here Lies T - Rex : His Heart Was Punched Out Of His Chest By A Robot , But Then Wind Blew His Heart Into The Robot's Face And The Robot Said , " Error , Oh Man , Gross " .
T - Rex , do you actually know what a calorie is ? It's just , sometimes people use the phrase without actually knowing what they're saying .
Attention , scientists ! Is there a SCIENTIFIC reason why poops are so gross ?
WAIT I DIDN'T SPECIFY WHICH NATION'S DOLLARS
END OF FLASHBACK .
Don't worry Utahraptor ; I'm accustomed to waiting for laughs .
$ 15 in accumulated chequing overage fees ? !
Perhaps you have not yet noticed my odd pronunciation of " empathetic " , hinting at a pun and a belief at odds with my literal speech ?
The issue is they're traveling back in time in an understood , repeatable way : slingshot around the sun ! It's just - why wouldn't they do that all the time ? When anything bad happens , whenever there's tension and the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance , I always think , " Well , worst case , they could just go back in time and fix this . I wonder - I wonder why they don't do that . "
As a man who is " without babies " , the idea of being in charge of another person's life seems insane . That's a lot of responsibility , and I have no idea if I'm qualified for that - or if anyone ELSE is , for that matter . So I have to ask -
My friend , nobody wants to put on a " Batman play " !
. . . Well , in my experience , anyway !
YEP .
YOU KNOW IT CAN'T . That would be heresy !
You totally are ! You never have a middle ground : it's always " oh , it's not for me " or " oh WOW this thing I don't have is so AMAZING how can this be so AWESOME ? "
MISTAKE COMICS
You might end up with an odd phrase or two , though , since you'd have to steer clear of all 'ing' verbs .
Two months ago I noticed I had a small case of the chubbs ! So I decided to lose some weight , and THEN , I lost the weight . I just ate fewer foods ?
Also , my head hurts and I feel like making puns involving the word " watch " !
Hee hee !
cannot long exist in our fallen mortal plane
Oh crap !
I'll tell you one thing !
The mission to find the treasure , the car chase : all a dream !
It's over now !
Aw geez . Aw GEEZ .
This is just Mario with genders flipped !
I MYSELF am an unsung genius whose works , while unappreciated in own time , will be beloved the world over after his death ! " If only we'd appreciated his work earlier , " they'll say , " the world might have more of his beautiful , beautiful artwork . "
That sounds great NOW , but wait until you realize scrambled eggs are impossible in your universe , since they'd keep reforming into regular eggs !
What ? I already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag -
I still TOTALLY need to let people know I'm acting against my will !
Your mom's a librarian ? !
Who is this " Timmy " guy ?
T - REX YOU JUST USED A GENDERED PROFESSION NOUN
And though I know that entropy makes everything decay / It's kinda left the shower - based aspects of my life in disarray !
Good one ! Um . . .
Whoops , pardon me .
Can I tough this ?
How depressing would it be to know you're part of the reason things aren't perfect ? To look in on the best of all possible worlds and notice you're not there .
Wait . . . WHY ? Are wishes REAL all of a sudden ?
[ [ thought bubble ] ] Hey baby do u like to kiss on dudes ? ? bc IM A DUDE
Also , make sure you can't wish away your ability to wish !
DO YOU BELIEVE AN OPTIONALLY NON - DESTRUCTIVE SANDBOX GAME IS POSSIBLE
Like , everybody is better for the experience ? Geez , man ! It's not that complicated a sentiment !
COME BLEED WITH US . COME BLEED WITH US , T - REX .
It's not going to work , my friend !
A strange game , Matthew Broderick . It seems the only winning move is not to play .
I'm serious ! It's possible that I'm just getting lucky and hitting the few pages that people created for me in advance !
Some words are special , reserved for only the worst situations , and as such carry weight when we dare to use them !
A TRUE FRIEND WOULD WATCH ME SLEEP .
2's interesting because it's the first positive even number , and 3's interesting because it's out closest single - digit approximation for pi and that's especially useful if you don't really care about pi !
Hooray for fiction : The Place Where We Imagined What Things Would Be Like If We Were Better Than We Are ! ( TM )
All this for a pun , huh T - Rex ?
In it , you have a REAL person engaged in a text conversation with both a person and a machine , and that person has to determine which responder is which . If the machine can appear more " alive " than the person , then they pass !
We can use some internal organs as emergency backups for other internal organs !
Again , these are imaginary .
The answer is Yes
Oh , and those fancy fake white wigs that olde - timey judges wear . They're BASICALLY hats .
Maybe I have been too hard on prenups . In a sense , they're sort of a Love Validater , right ?
Historical accident , really .
I'm going to eat SO MANY WINGS !
But those two animals would never meet in real life , right ?
All it does is make us want things that we can't have , and can't even work towards having . Forget it ! It's WASTED TIME .
So - did you drink the juice !
Hey God ! Quick question : how long can I live without water ?
Whoah . I'm pretty relentless .
My bike broke because I had maintained it poorly . But you know what they say !
Why are you yelling ?
. . . I wonder if we'll ever know who we cheesed off in 1886 .
1970s : martial arts become popular , which allows the majority of Americans to survive the decade . Songs are weaponized .
I notice you are attractive !
However , she COULD ascertain that by putting the skull above a reservoir with a turbine attached , she could generate endless supplies of energy . And it turns out her backyard was a curs ? d graveyard of the ancients , so there were tons more blood skulls to be had . They almost seemed to crawl out of the dirt on their own !
. . . Um , at this juncture I feel you should know I spent most of yesterday eating chips in my underpants
Pain !
It does sort of suggest that if someone said just the right words to you , you'd become instantly paralyzed with a life - shattering fear .
I am using the second " it " to refer to my entire experience watching the show , of course , and not to the show in particular . The program was exactly the sort of thing I had long wanted to see on television ! I HAD vaguely sort of planned to maybe try my hand at writing television , but there's no point now , because the talent behind last night's episode have accomplished all that I would have like to have done . THANKS TELEVISION INDUSTRY .
What do you call fifteen PROFESSION MEMBERS buried up to their necks in sand ?
Maybe it was the cusses you chose ?
Precisely , my friend !
I don't really see - -
No you didn't !
I actually meant my question in the most basic sense , but I want to appear deep . I'd better act angsty and play along .
Oh ! Why don't PROFESSION MEMBERS play hide and seek ?
How is that a bad thing ? Hello ? ! The laws worked for friggin' ROBOTS .
These certainly are valid objections to a magical event that has never occurred .
Perhaps it's beautiful that people would invent a truth serum but not a lie serum !
I have always been a fan of writing " stop following me " , just because I love the idea of a guy who is being followed by someone , and then gets SO PISSED OFF that he spins around , whips out his chequebook , and cuts the dude a cheque then and there just to make him go somewhere else .
BUT SECRETELY , WHEN T - REX IS HOME ALONE :
Sounds like a pretty standard nightmare , my friend !
There ! It says : " poo " .
Somebody say yes !
I , too , will take it to my grave .
I may have unintentionally lied or alienated every one of my friends !
For example , January 1st could be " excited " . And then January 2nd could be " elated " . And then January 3rd could be " disgust " .
Wow !
Today we celebrate these innovators who made life slightly more convenient for a little while , but then made life much more inconvenient for a lot longer . They're a part of our heritage .
Greetings , class ! Greetings , T - Rex :
To start , let's assume you know every word used in this comic !
Now that's what I call a REAL long shot !
Does that mean your body is . . . less than perfect ?
What the heck English ?
Hey ! !
an educational installment
They're allergic to gluten : THEIR BODIES DON'T ABSORB IT . That makes them the only ones immune to governmental mind control ! They're our freedom fighters , Utahraptor ! !
T - REX YOU HAVE TURNED A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEX INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT LITERARY TECHNIQUES
One day a driver picked up a young lady with a red scarf around her neck , who was hitchhiking , and drove the hitchhiker to her destination .
BACK IN THE PRESENT :
How quickly we find ourselves in the positions of adults !
Sounds great ?
I MEANT WHICH IS THE BEST ENTERPRISE AS IN A THING THAT IS UNDERTAKEN SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES OR ENGAGING IN TABLETOP GAMING
Does he like Asian cultures too , or just Asian women ?
Hey , the 90s called !
And I wish you wouldn't interrupt my sexualizin' , Utahraptor ! !
I can see you licking your lips while looking at my sumptuous belly , toaster !
She loves me and she's super smart at lots of things , but I'm still smarter at a few things , like knowing how to skateboard best , and we get along really well . Oh ! And she's a flapper . AND an aviatrix !
Ahem . Vampire Novel 2000 ! Vampire Novel 2000 opens up on the first page , where the title of the book is printed . Your eyes caress the words , your lips mouthing them as you read : 'Vampire Novel' . And then , two numbers that are also four , the paradox of repeated digits . 2000 . A number that promise the future . A year , but more than a year : an aesthetic . The future we all remember , now novelized , and also with vampires .
It is ! It's obviously not ALL peener - in - cloaca " let's hatch an egg " stuff . You can have sex even if you don't have peeners or cloacas , AND HOW , but with all the stuff folks DO when they have sex , it's kinda hard to define !
SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
If I changed my name to " Well and Good " , then if I was killed and mangled in a horribly brutal death , the inspector on the scene could chuckle and nudge his friend and say " Hey . I suppose this is MOSTLY Well and Good ? "
So let's decide on a phrase you can use : something you'd never say normally !
If you have any idea how we know each other , drop me a line !
As she entered the house that night , the door slammed behind her !
That was with snow ! ALSO , maybe what I said yesterday was EXTREMELY AWESOME . Maybe it is worth hearing again !
Was it batteries , maybe ?
Whoah , T - Rex ! Such sexualized language !
And it turns out that the effect only shows up in specific trivial situations ! But it's a popular idea . I think some people just like the idea that depression might be an advantage !
LISTEN ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT I CAN CREATE UNIVERSES
No . That's MURDER .
My root beer !
Aw , shoot !
So what's the deal with . . .
Man . Men CAN be bitches .
I hate it when you're watching a movie with your parents and there's a sex scene ! Yes , you may quote me .
Not even like , clean impurities . Impurities we got by letting some fruit rot on the ground until some seeds inside it started turning dirt into more fruit . If we're fancy , we spread another animal's poop on top of the seeds so we make our impure water faster .
The same suspicion also applies to ugly people !
However , when I arrived , they were out of tickets !
Wear this panel as an ID tag at all times !
What about the discrimination ? The female lions aways have to hunt while the men sleep .
Well , not right now , but tell you what , T - Rex : if any come up , you'll be the first person I'll call !
The velocity of a body remains constant unless the body is acted upon by an external force .
Yes ! ! YES , let's make this happen ! PLEASE SANTA MAKE MY EROTIC FICTION REAL
My lady , wouldst thou be so kind as to prepare me my dinner and birth me my babies ?
If you've got a transplant , it's like you've leveled up ! AS A PERSON . The rest of us are stuck with the genes we were born with , but you've got SELECTION . You're made out of the best parts of other people !
FUN ALTERNATIVES TO THANKSGIVING
Are there any more interesting universals ?
I found out it's not plagiarism that way ! !
" WHAT IS THE DEAL "
It's just the verbs . And the adjectives . Anyway , I think I know what real bisexuals do .
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT
Did you know ocean covers 71 % of the planet ? That really boring , but it's also true !
Nope ! Amnesia !
Which guy ?
THEY DECIDE ON THE STEAM BUT FEEL BAD , EVEN THOUGH DROMICEIOMIMUS SAID SHE LOVED IT . THIS MALAISE LINGERS FOR A FEW DAYS .
He's LIVID , man ! He's TENSE . Bound so tightly with tension and anger , he approaches the state of rigor mortis !
Welcome to joke school ! I am T - Rex , your teacher . Let's open on a joke . Utahraptor ?
My friend :
MARCH :
OH NO SOMEHOW I GOT SAD
How come none of you guys have described me as an " elite professional " yet ? It's really weird !
" Yeah , and look , one of the dessert options is a piece of DATE bar ! Should we get one ? Hmm ? Do you agree it's appropriate that we get a . . . DATE bar ? ? "
Well ! That settles that !
What ? You LOST the baby pterodactyl you were sitting ? You LOST a BABY ? T - Rex ! THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER DEAL THAN YOU THINK IT IS !
today's comic
You're sexy . . . at sea ? Okay ! I'm done !
But why wouldn't he just go by " Albert " ? Or " Alberto " ?
[ [ off - panel ] ] But in The Future , we all have hoverbeds !
I tried to imitate it .
Huh ! You should put " Contractions I Saw On TV That I'ma Gonna Use " on your list .
" Life is a neoclassical pastiche " !
T - That's actually a really interesting question !
. . . I think I gave myself an awesomeness stroke
" Who knows ? " ! You're supposed to know ! You're the guy going arounds saying the world will end !
It's okay , I'll describe it with words ! It starts shyly but soon coquettishly reveals a delightful sweetness , not cloying , with hints of musk . Warm , elegant notes of pepper and elderflower , piquant and vivid , highlight the finish .
That's . . . !
Wow , I had no idea you were so fascist !
I ASSURE YOU
It's true , it's true !
SORRY BUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SERVICE FOR THOUSANDS OF PAYING CUSTOMERS EACH DAY .
So rather than working my whole life to master just a single art , instead I'm gonna hang out at artist bars and be REAL FUN . You know , maybe pick up a few artists ? Maybe become their muse ? Maybe inspire them to new heights of artistic expression with my rockin' bob ? ?
And you see prenups as being the ultimate expression of love * .
Prove to me that the world wasn't created 1 millisecond ago !
I'M JUST SCROLLING ON BY
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE
Seriously ? Can you teach me ?
Really ? That seems pretty improbable , since I know that eyelids closing is just incidental to the sneezing refl -
Who here can name a game that sounds like it's way more fun than it actually is ?
Aww ! You must have been such a cute kid !
And I TOTALLY haven't paid it back yet , either !
The race is about to start ! Just admit you don't know racecar stuff !
Where the hell did he go ? He was right here !
" The Song Only Awesome People Like ; This Can Save You Some Time When Making New Friends ( Thank Me Later ) "
Anyway , I guess It's just one more day up in the canyons for me !
Thanks , ladies !
How is naming you as beneficiary revenge ?
HEY T - REX DO YOU KNOW WHERE WIND COMES FROM
Man , who's going to catch us ? There's no such thing as SKY POLICE , Utahraptor . Laws don't extend more than 100 meters off the ground anyway .
Today : Origin of the dinosaur comics , part IV
Well I'm hoping you'll invent tastes yet untasted , T - Rex . Throw off the shackles of outrageous orange and " screamin' green " ! Let's see what nostalgia tastes like , or summer ! Give me my romance flavoured Fruit Roll - Ups !
Okay okay , IDEAS : " GAME OVER " , " MAKE OUTS " , " PONY TIME " , " WHAT ISUP " , " EATP IZZA " , and " BARK YDOG " . Ooh ! And " TAKE BOAT " .
a comic
Space Rex !
Barn - floor checkerboard tiles in a " Jesus in the manger " sculpture ? WHY NOT ! !
Don't I know it .
PANTYHOSE ( 2 PAIR ) :
Metasexual :
Reality : boring sometimes !
Pretty good .
Man , I can't believe that worked !
OKAY FINE WHATEVER I'M GOING TO GO PLAY SEGA GENESIS
I am not a guy who has the best record with Christmas presents ! Or the best record with presents in general . Or the best um , record , of any description .
Here is a picture of me with my friend Dromiceiomimus . We dated and are still really close ! I hope you are cool with that . SHE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE . I HOPE YOU ARE STILL COOL WITH THAT . I WILL CALL HER SOMETIMES .
Um , okay : " Just one , but it doesn't matter : they'll never see the light anyway . "
Seeing as i missed Thanksgiving last month , I am celebrating a new holiday today , one which I just invented ! I call it , " American Thanksgiving " !
And now , all the dodos are dead !
I would like my face on the money , please !
CAN I COME
If you messed things up it would completely change the present ! If her kids didn't multiply somebody else's would , and everyone alive today would NEVER BE BORN .
Wendy : why are you bragging ?
Earthquakes , huh ? Huh . I guess Herostratus wasn't actually a time - travelling , mustachio - twirling , World Wonder destroying villain . Ah well ! That's why pencils have erasers , right ?
That's no secret , baby !
Then , that night , they had SEXUAL CONGRESS !
Tired of fried ? ENJOY DELICIOUS CHIPS .
That is kinda hilarious if it's like this big weiner guy doing that !
Thank you T - Rex . You're not so bad yourself .
I'm not thinking of any in particular , actually ! Just the general case .
Why would I want to hang out with chumps that are worse than me ? That sounds terrible .
Well , no , T - Rex , because you probably wouldn't want to be fed something you didn't like .
Oh hah hah because for a second there you looked like a crazy person is all
SEXT : ur playing Mario 2 . " this game owns " i say but u hate the vegetable based gameplay mechanics .
BASICALLY .
One minor concern : yeah , it IS spring , but it's still kinda cool out . We might get cold .
BACKSTORY : T - REX IS WORRIED HE'S NOT AS AFFLUENT AS HE SHOULD BE ?
It seems to me there's a lot of room for improvement there ! And it seems to me that perhaps - I'M the one who's taken the next step and evolved a vision system that spits data out in 5 milliseconds , instead of 50 ? ?
For example , " factory " is short for " manufactory " !
Besides , we all have stupid names here anyway
And also because we can eat each other if things don't go as planned ! !
Standard - tastic ?
Well & # 8212 ;
I don't get it , T - Rex . I mean , I get that " here " sounds like " ear " , but -
And it only costs fifty bucks !
You propose something different ?
People can still disagree with me , but they're now at least saying they don't have any special expertise !
CASE FILE # 5219
Maybe they do !
Holy crap , Utahraptor ! Would it be a plot twist IN MY OWN LIFE to spend all my time rewriting out - of - copyright books ? ?
T - Rex , that's terrible !
man , SCREW heart disease
Friggin' do it already ! !
I don't think about video games as much as you do ! Okay ? You've got to understand this ! T - REX EQUALS DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES ALL THAT OFTEN !
you do look terrible today ! she was only being honest like a good friend
The point is that if you've only got one " true love " in the world , then the odds of meeting her are super small .
Here's hoping !
[ [ music notes ] ] I'll tell you something [ [ music notes ] ] I think you'll understand [ [ music notes ] ] When I say that something [ [ music notes ] ] I wanna hold CO2 gas emissions at their 1950s level which will lead to a better 2014 for us all [ [ music notes ] ]
Following this rule , I could feed my vegetarian friends delicious steak sandwiches , because that's what I'd like ! Mmm - mmm delicious !
Well , why not just reframe them so they're talents that you HAD , but missed out on ? Like , you could have been a great soccer player if only you'd practiced when you were a kid . So the talent's still there , it's simply your flabby aged and relatively enfeebled body that's no longer suitable !
You'll love to " pick up " women when you're picking up a book with female characters inside !
A FEW MONTHS LATER :
And everyone ELSE in that heaven is an illusion constructed to maximize your pleasure , and therefore there's a separate heaven for each sentient being .
What ? NO ! I'm barely namby ! !
How much further to the gym
So here's some quotable quotes for you , Dromiceiomimus ! " Failure is just success rounded down " , " I enjoy friendly good times " , and " Whom is responsible for all these hards on ? " . Perhaps you'd like to compile them into a volume ?
. . . Dromiceiomimus ?
BUILD ME A TEMPLE
So ! Pay up , Moriarty !
WEIRD , MAN
And you'll need to totally assume that the world wasn't started a microsecond ago with your " memories " merely part of the initial state .
* choke *
Yeah so ? So what ? What are you trying to say ? Are you trying to say that I'm gay ? Because if you are , I'm not , you know .
Also what ?
Over years , in tiny undigested pieces .
HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO WOMEN WHO REMIND HIM OF HIS MOTHER
Whatever , man ! Bears do it , and everybody likes bears !
Shut up !
Hello , is Utahraptor there ?
Right . But we've marked the line they would fall along , if they existed . We call it " the equator " .
Hooray ! !
It is a good thing to be doing on a school night !
Let's go over the symptoms : are you kinda angry , but also kinda sad ?
You're crazy !
Please read what this card says because it applies 100 & to you ! !
CLEARLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE GRAIN OF SAND LEFT IT'S NOT A HEAP ANYMORE
Well , most everything changes with time , T - Rex !
Indeed ! In comparison , being an anagramist today is totally boring , as nobody is encoding fundamental discoveries into word games anymore .
DROMICEIOMIMUS ! That hardly seems sporting !
" 'Twas " and " 'Tis " ! Short for " it was " and " it is " . Anything that starts with " it " you can contract , and 'twill sound great !
Time to do it up . . .
If all else fails , many simply name their child after whatever they were conceived on top of . People named " Clay " , " Ivy " , and " Cash " : BEHOLD YOUR ORIGINS . The end .
T - Rex this isn't scary at all ! I'm LEARNING instead of being TERRIFIED .
I am as much myself as I have ever been !
I'll be there too , T - Rex ! This'll be fun !
Okay , sure , maybe !
OH MY GOSH BODIES ARE GROSS
Okay , which genre are we talking about here ?
Bah ! Nostalgia !
So the questions is :
A Story about a Man , by T - Rex !
I can hook you up with an " Attaboy Special " , which includes a five word compliment and a firm handshake .
Because that's what my charity was looking into : reanimating long - dead corpses ! We was gonna make zombies .
Maybe the answer is that you don't !
BUT I CONFESS I AM AS YET UNFAMILIAR WITH THE DUCK HUNT GENRE
Phew ! Hey , Dromiceiomimus ! Don't look now , but the couple I passed behind me is TOTALLY breaking up !
Did NOBODY read my email in full last night ? You should be out talking me up to others , getting me some new friends !
FINE . Relationships , like metaphors , are REALLY hard to get right .
AAAH ! NOT AGAIN !
Hey , let's go flip a coin to decide ! And then we can deduce the outcome by thinking about it !
" I'm really glad I didn't lie about this , Utahraptor ! "
When I grow up I want to be . . . AN ASTRONAUT !
My last pet dog ran away because I never fed him . But THIS new dog I'm sure to feed every day !
I AM HAPPY TO HELP THOUGH
Straight outta prehistoric Compton , a crazy motherf * * * er named T - Rex !
Well , I guess you could just restore to an earlier save point .
Is - - is the world . . . broken ? !
T - Rex , stop it ! You can't just go around putting words in people's mouths !
PROOF BY COUNTEREXAMPLE : I have probably practiced eating hundreds of thousands of times ! And yet , sometimes I screw it up . Practice clearly hasn't helped me here , because I should be super awesome at eating things now !
Who the hell goes to Cornwall ?
What ? I don't smell funny on Tuesdays ! !
For the first time in his infinite lifespan North felt a twinge of emotion .
It sounds a little like there's a bunch of female cannibals eating you .
What are you , a history major ? That stuff went down YESTERDAY .
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX HAS LEARNED ENGLISH ENTIRELY FROM KOREAN - ENGLISH PHRASEBOOKS :
Hey . It'll be better for all of us if we just find out who's doing it .
Man . Logical explanations keep letting me down ! !
One sec .
I have 12 identical balls , but one is EITHER heavier or lighter than the rest , and I've got a balance scale that measures relative weight .
It's too late ! Line 10 was already interpreted !
Absurdism comics
no , we're saved !
Yeah , press releases are just you saying stuff ; papers will only run with interesting ones . If they haven't any real news to go with already , I mean .
Whatever , Dromiceiomimus ! " I'd rather have a life of oh wells than what ifs " !
For native Earth life , absolutely !
DIFFERENT WAYS TO SAY GOODBYE :
Or maybe I'd say " Honeybabe , you blew it ! "
They just suck at the game !
But there's also an average period between fertilization and birth / hatching , and people will readily discuss how much a baby is " early " or " late " in regards to this average ! So do you want to know . . . THE EXACT DAY YOU WERE CONCEIVED ? ?
MEANWHILE , IN TUDOR ENGLAND !
YEAH THEY JUST SHOWED UP ONE DAY
In West Philadelphia , born and raised : on the playground was where I spent most of my days ! Chillinh out , maxin' , relaxing all cool and all shooting some b - ball outside of the school , when a couple of guys ( they were up to no good ) started making trouble in my neighbourhood ! I got in ONE LITTLE FIGHT and my mom got scared , and said
I didn't know you liked George Clooney !
Why do ghosts like mines ?
SO HERE'S THE IDEA : in the year 614 someone - or someONES - alter the calendar ahead by 297 years , skipping right to the year 911 . And records of this jump are lost , because it's the middle ages ! And that explains why not many things happened in this SUPER BORING time period !
Well you're in a good mood today , T - Rex ! It's always a pleasure to see you !
Okay , sex happens when one or more people do , um . . . sex ?
Faster than FRIGHT travel ! !
That's right , ladies ! I am going to be a dude with direction !
Anyway back to my story ! In it my man faces many challenges and obstacles but eventually saves the princess !
7 ) the most beautiful words you can imagine
My friend , you took helicopter rides and white water rafting , two awesome things , and the best you could imagine to do with them was commute and buy your groceries ? THOSE ARE OLD PEOPLE DREAMS .
OH MY GOSH , what if ?
All are accepted ! Hooray ! !
WEIRD ! !
YOUR LIST OF EMOTIONS IS A SHORT STORY HUH
How are you measuring volume ? Sure ANCIENT books are lost , but we generate so much text today that it's probably a tiny percentage overall !
Contact me at suckitup @ walkitoff . net , democracy lovers !
It was SO good !
Come to think of it , yeah ! I bet He'd do something lame like making all of the Universe the joke or something !
Plenty !
Sure , I - -
So who here wants to TALK ABOUT FEELINGS ? Wooo ! Everyone loves a dude who talks about feelings , right ?
They had 'em in Latin , rewrote them all in French , and then rewrote them all AGAIN in English . And when this translating job was going on , the lawyers wanted to make sure there was no meaning lost , so in the English laws they'd use synonyms originally from Latin or French to ensure they were absolutely clear . So on top of saying " cease " , they'd add " and desist " !
You know how long it's been since I brought food to a beach , and then , sitting on that beach with friends , consumed the food ?
T - Rex , this is basically the spotlight fallacy !
Sure ! It's great !
Oh ! Um -
What do they look like ?
Don't worry ! LinkedIn will keep emailing you over and over again for the rest of your natural life !
YES . As Shakespeare said , " beauty is in the eye of the beholder " .
UTAH - RAPTOR , NO
MAXIMUM - POSSIBLE HAND :
A womboval ?
. . . and I discovered something shocking ! You know that apple that Eve eats because she was hungry and also recognized it's unreasonable to respect a law that is itself unreasonable ? ? well guess what ? THE BIBLE NEVER SAYS WHAT SHE EATS IS AN APPLE !
Alright man ! Today is the day to accomplish some friggin' GOALS . Today is the day to achieve ALL the goalsets ! !
LET'S LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT
THE GUY WHO KEPT TAKING BITES OUT OF ANIMALS
- body will pay much for an artificial diamond but nice try
ANYONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THEM ENDS UP BEING REINCARNATED AS THE UGLIEST POO BUG IN THE WORLD
It's a stupid fantasy ! It doesn't even make sense !
1 ) Pyramid Schemes
PULP .
SOCIoLOGICAL THEORY : We , as a people , have lost the " big picture " , worrying more about problems at home than problems that affect us on a planetary scale ! We have lost a sense of global purpose . And I have proof !
Anyway , what's remarkable is that Dante puts both homosexuals and money lenders in the same circle ! He thought both were unnatural : interest makes something ( money ) from nothing ( no action on the lender's part ) , while homosexuals make nothing ( hot gay action doesn't count ! ) from something ( their reproductive organs ) .
Today is my " day of rage " .
Me neither !
Once upon a time :
WAY AHEAD OF YOU
Wait - YOU'RE the guy who reverts all my dog updates ? ?
Dromiceiomimus ! What are you doing up ?
AND AFTER , LAWSUITS
Performative utterances are things that you can say , and hey presto , you've changed your life and the world around you ! You've changed your life with WORDS . Like the Shahadah , this is insane ! This is totally insane .
Oh , T - Rex ! Back from your adventure through time ?
Well , his name spells " EGG " and you promised an " EGG - citing twist " , the English equivalent of a flashing neon sign that reads " Why Not Think About Eggs " .
Oh heck ! Epitaph Thursday AGAIN ? ?
AGE 30 : KISSING BUMS ON HIS ELBOWS
. . . I don't know that word , T - Rex .
Oui , je suis un loup - garou !
Hey . Listen . If you keep up this negativity , I'm going to STOP my constant mantra of " Utahraptor is the orange one " . I'll replace it , I swear .
And ? How was it ?
Let's say I loan you a puppy , and we agree that for every month you have my puppy , you owe me 15 % more puppy . This is called " interest " ! And if it's " compounded " every month , after one month you'll owe me 15 % extra , but after TWO months you'll owe me 32 % more puppy , since that 15 % puppy interest is being applied on the original puppy plus the extra puppy percentage you already owe me !
The whole deal with " I think , therefore I am " is that Descartes is all " DAAAAAAMN , I can't be sure of ANYTHING ! My senses are flawed . All I know for sure is I keep STRESSIN' about this stuff ! " and then his girlfriend is all " If you're so hung up on this then you must exist , huh baby ? " and Descartes is all " Yes . That is true . I will write this down in Latin . "
HOWEVER , I WILL ACCEPT THAT MARGARITA NOW
UTAHRAPTOR it's my story ! Go tell your own story !
Are you there , The Present ? It's me , The Future ! We've got some questions for y'all !
This is just a picture of Richard the Third's head on Duke Nukem's body .
So orange beats blue , blue beats yellow , and yellow beats orange !
You're out of control !
BACHELOR PARTY
Every culture on Earth that has snow builds these creatures , and we never wondered why . We were fools . Blind , damned fools .
s / see / boo /
This colloid may be sold in your supermarket as " butter " !
That sounds like the complaint of someone who DOESN'T intend to win the Subway Restaurants Alternate - History " Think Fresh ! " Fiction Challenge !
When I die , I want to be buried in a bog . I want to become a bog person !
" Again , no worries . " said Angola .
Oh ?
Nope , skull ! Men have heavier skulls than women , so again , men find light skulls unbelievably sexy , and women find heavy skulls ASTONISHINGLY GORGEOUS .
Good point
OTHERS NOW SAY " THERE COME A TIME WHEN THON MUST LOOK THONSELF IN MIRROR " .
Dear audio diary : I can't write any more because everything I write is about Moriarty trying to pull a fast one on a team of Sherlock Babies !
IF ANYONE TELLS YOU WRITING IS HARD THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT FEWER WRITERS TO COMPETE WITH
Dude , we're literally DIFFERENT SPECIES . Any common ancestor WE have , we probably wouldn't recognize .
We all probably could , if we wanted .
Man , leave her alone !
Civilization probably meant it personally too !
They all know !
Yeah ! !
We're going to have a full line of cards , Dromiceiomimus ! " I'm not straight / but I'm straight for you " , and there's a little picture of a RULER .
Why are you so interested in this , anyway ?
Perfect . So ! Can you help ME move next week ?
Unicorns and flying submarines are two things that do not exist !
I am a dude in need of a catchy slogan . Something to put under my name on business cards to convince people they should associate with me and maybe be my friend !
But T - Rex , most fan fiction has characters from TV and movies acting implausibly in implausible situations , and also kissing each other ! Does - does yours ?
Oh , sure ! NO PROBLEM !
I could've started a family or three , either in series OR in parallel !
You should know , I don't take sarcastic cases !
The number 0 is interesting because it's the only number we've got that you can't divide by without causing a black hole .
Whatever ! Come on , ghosts ! ! Have you tried NOT being blurry and transparent ?
Yeah , what if instead of ruining track and field ceremonies , we bought awards for each other ? Yours could say something like " SASSIEST DUDE " -
Oh , no , of course not !
" And when she writes us ghostly notes , she uses letters unfamiliar to us and avoids letters we use like thorne and yogh . Communication is difficult , if not impossible . "
Absolutely ! !
Layers , Dromiceiomimus ! SEQUENCES .
Back to my amazing story , & # 8220 ; Tuqqy the Tugboat Tugs . . . In Space ! & # 8221 ; It & # 8217 ; s about a NON - ANTHROPOMORPHIZED tugboat who tugs , in space . His windshield does not double as eyes . Tugboats are not like that .
Her admirers held an annual fair where they sold each other lace : " St . Audrey's lace " . This became corrupted to " tawdry lace " - and when that style of lace fell out of fashion , " tawdry " kinda seemed like an adjective that mean " cheap " or " sucky " , so that's what it became !
HAH HAH HAH !
I wish that happened more in real life .
Wait up for me !
Are you kidding ?
He only tried to pus me a li'l !
Only chums wait for a nickname to coalesce around them naturally ! As a non - chumpified guy , I'm CHOOSING my new nickname .
Fear !
Oh ! The perfect dog features a stomach that can transform any food into energy at 100 % efficiency !
MAN I WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BE A HARD QUESTION LIKE WHAT IF ALL THE TIME AND ENERGY PEOPLE PUT INTO HAVING AND THINKING ABOUT SEX WAS PUT INTO BETTERING THE PHYSICAL WORLD INSTEAD
Truly , I am the epitome of the male form !
There were gross red egg - sac things at the bottom of my drink , Dromiceiomimus ! And I thought " Gross " and then I said " At least I didn't consume any of them though ! " and then I forgot about how you should never say things like that because then I found some sacs stuck between my teeth too .
And here we go !
Whoah , did I say " comedy " ? I meant to say " an encounter with prejudice about model minorities " .
I'M RETIRING AS A CHAMP
You and whoever went this card to you totally have a history together !
Dear recipient of this comic :
I'm serious , once they invent the happy pill I'm out
I can't make you dance , that's true !
Of course ! AFTER we talk about " less " and " fewer " .
Alright , fine , so it's a battery problem !
Boop boop ba - doopa doop !
It's true !
Holy crap he was so handsome ! And smart too , actually ! !
HOW TO GET A WOMAN TO LIKE YOU
Look I'm just having a rough week okay
Yep , as that little adventure just showed , " STOP THE WEDDING ! ! " is but one of the several phrases you can get in trouble for yelling at weddings . Others include " THE BRIDE'S BEEN CLONED ! ! " and " THE GROOM IS REALLY JUST THREE KIDS IN A TRENCHCOA - -
And he notices this women who's pretty small !
Except that doesn't include oceans and stuff - things you can't buy !
Well that is INCORRECT , as I said it this morning when I dropped my toast on the ground . " Oh brother , " I said , " what's next ? ? " It was amazing
I'm behind you .
This story would be stronger if it didn't mention Subway so much !
Tarzan is nothing but primitivist alternate - universe Batman fanfic ! !
So run the experiments on the future !
Agreed !
Well ! SO MUCH FOR THAT FUNNY RANT .
Why are we talking about this ?
Alright dudes , listen , it's time to MAN UP . It's time for us to become more CULTURALLY MASCULINE .
Ooh ! Or they say " SKULLS to meet you ! " Or " Aw man ! RIBS AGAIN ? " while punching a skeleton in the ribs !
Utahraptor !
Luckily for us there are other things you can breathe instead of air ! SCIENTIFICALLY , air is about 78 % nitrogen , 20 % oxygen , and 2 % a bunch of other gasses that I don't care about right now . But you don't have to breathe that ! You can also breathe PURE OXYGEN , at least for a while ! Eventually fluid accumulates in your lungs but , I mean , WHATEVER .
I am your man !
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
Ancients pondered for years about which came first : the chicken or the egg ? Um , guys !
Tra la la !
T - REX LISTEN THIS IS WHY I DON'T THINK ABOUT RELIGION THAT HARD
COMPRESSED FILM COMICS today's film :
Sweet ! So what are we looking for , T - Rex ?
Why , hello there , Utahraptor ! Wouldn't you say I sound like a young Cary Grant ?
woo ! party ! [ [ T - Rex is imagining himself holding a beach ball , he looks so happy ] ]
Nope ! Just me , your male friend Utahraptor ! Were you about to have a conversation about feelings ?
How can we engage with our favourite feelings like we engage with our favourite brands if those feelings don't have clear statements of brand identity that we can pivot conversation around ? ?
Okay cool , we'll meet the day after THEBASEMENTISFULLOFBODIESDAY .
Hello ! I have some opinions about your name . Perhaps you'd like to hear them ?
Man , it sure has been a long December ! Maybe this year will be better than the last .
Now you're catching on !
I get it ! You intend to express all that you are through art !
Woah . That's - that's actually a really long time .
SECRET of the MEDICAL PROFESSION !
What if you said " Knife to meet you " ?
Scientists need to invent a way to make DNA work like in cartoons
Now what you see is just the best : we're talking using light ! It's great in wartime and in peace , just as long as they're at night !
Does it feel like the first taste of a homecooked meal after days of terrible fast food ? Does it feel like pulling on a favourite sweater , the smell of fabric comforting you in a way that you can BARELY EVEN EXPLAIN ? ?
People do fine with approximations !
Beef liver , fish , eggs , and milk , among others .
Wow ! The plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky .
It doesn't ?
Hah , of course not !
Yes , anyway , apropro of nothing , I'd just like to say that being a skeptic who relies on repeated and external verification has helped me a lot in life . Scientific method , baby ! Woooo !
Impossible !
Hey everyone ! This guy really wants to kiss ! !
Want to come over for a slumber party ?
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR A CAREER CHANGE T - REX
Yes , those are all examples of mediums one can work in .
Wait , are we applying these in logical or chronological order ?
Aw , come on ! You only bid like $ 20 !
FILMIC TECHNIQUES COMICS
EXPIRY DATE COMICS !
I know it well .
Ah , the start of a brand new year . There's so much potential ! What could possibly go wrong ?
Wow , like - cyborgs ?
TEN DIFFERENT WAYS TO MEET A NEW GIRLFRIEND OR BOYFRIEND
JIVE - ASS HUNK
Hey , thanks for reading my dating site profile and then viewing this image ! I guess it's time to tell you the truth . . .
But they DO prevent spur of the moment suicides !
oh thank you
EPILOGUE : A FEW DAYS LATER , T - REX CALLS HIS GRANDMOTHER .
Son , I -
See ? It's true !
Man ! I've got to start inviting REAL people to my parties .
Homecare is when doctors or nurses visit you in your own home !
T - REX YOU SURE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SEX A LOT LATELY
Oh , have you met my friend , T - Rex ? Idis A . Greeh ?
. . . would become TARZAN OF THE APES .
Occam's razor is a principle of simplicity ! It says that one should always choose the simplest explanation for something , when given a choice between competing theories of different complexity .
But doesn't it take more than simply listing old things to really be nostalgic ?
. . . Never really understood it till now
OHHH
Whoops ! ! Turns out this was fatal to basically everyone ?
It reassures us that we live in a logical universe where effect does not precede cause ! !
I wonder if there are any revelations that would make me want to end a long - term friendship with someone . What would they have to say ?
You are right !
Aw , frig ! !
POETS
ONE FINAL QUESTION . The actual gold Fields Medal prize you get : is it known as " the Fields Metal " ?
Good one , me
It's tricky to rock a rhyme , to rock a rhyme that's right on time , for doggies !
And of course , a young lady that is in a prime position for a good stomping herself .
It has everything a good movie needs .
NORMALLY , they're limited to eighteen characters . So you'll have to stick with names like Enuf Tequila Horse , Hoof Hearted , Yoshi : The Horse , Horseback Mountain , and Robohorse .
Is in an MP3 player ? Look , they have MP3 players here !
( M ) urder !
Okay , so I can't write love poetry . That's fine . There are plenty of dudes who will write it for me . But I can PROBABLY write a pretty kick - ass SHERLOCK HOLMES story !
Dr . Doctor , what's the latest on my ankle ?
Oh man ! ABSOLUTELY !
No wait , we should get the software developed before we worry about naming it !
Yep ! Professional grade ultra sweet dudeness , right here .
This is what I've been waiting for , you guys !
I have no idea ! Oh , if only I could control Angola , but this character is a maverick who plays by his own rules !
Man ! Even I'D dump me right now !
THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD
I guess . . . a Facebook event ?
Prove it !
It's a time for us to reflect on all the great things we have , such as food and shelter ! You spend an evening with friends and family . Want to come over for American Thanksgiving ?
Is it possible to imagine something SO INSANELY DISGUSTING that I actually , physically , throw up ? Is my imagination that powerful ?
" Babies Sporting Monocles " ?
He dropped out of this project when the nudity started ! !
Some people do this , T - Rex ! There's advantages to it .
How do you figure ?
I remember it well ; I had a disappointing dish of cuttlefish .
EARTH DAY WAS SEVERAL DAYS AGO
ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH
Guys ! I just had a revelation about God ! For serious !
Dromiceiomimus , do you ever approach something new , and sort of decide if you want to be really good at it , or just a dabbler ?
COMICS ? ?
I've got some just for you !
Keep up the good work !
If only .
Spread 'em , perp !
Yes ! Exactly !
Yep , here they are !
Outside of the card is just the words , " I'M NOT GAY . " , all caps , a nice bold sans - seirf on a stark white background . You open it up , and in smaller type it reads " but I'm gay for you " ! And there's a little hearts ! OH MY GOD !
He's basically a pretty good guy ! If you agree : panel 3
Guys , guys ! !
Yeah , but that image is complicated - it additionally includes both aging and menopausal issues !
- apparently unable to PENETRATE your skepticism -
Dromiceiomimus , I don't see species : I just see PEOPLE .
Yesterday !
Dromiceiomimus ! I can throw my voice ! Check it out !
Oh boy !
Whoah , no , that's -
DOES IT MATTER ? I found out I'm a creepy stalker ! !
Holy crap , you're right ! So what you're saying is . . . the sum of mes across the multiverse will always be more awesome than in one individual timeline ? ?
THIS IS MY ONLY DYING WISH .
YES AND I DID NOT SURVIVE MY ORDEAL TO BE JUDGED BY THOSE WITH BETTER DECISION - MAKING SKILLS
Look , I just want to be able to use " daffy " again . I want to say , " What a daffy car that is ! " and have nobody get that far - off " Huh , I wonder if they're still putting Daffy Duck on mugs " look in their eyes .
Hey T - Rex , I left some music at your house !
Everyone's a winner !
The rubber bands !
Hey T - Rex , have you fed your dog yet ?
Or talking , for that matter ?
LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS today's technique : FLASH FORWARD
It's common knowledge who said it ! Sheesh ! GEORGE SANTAYANA .
Right ! I start with my leg raised as so , and then -
It's just -
EARLER :
Lots of reasons !
ANYWAY , T - REX GOES BACK IN TIME TO WHEN HE WAS 20 , FINDS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE , AND MARRIES HER :
T - REX HAS MET A MAN WHOSE VOICE SOUNDS JUST LIKE A TEXT - TO - SPEECH SYNTHESIZER ! NEAT
IT'S OKAY
It'd be great because people would have solid goals - nobody would be left wondering what to do with their lives !
Oh my God !
OK then !
PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH AN ALIVE PHYSICAL WOMAN
You were hoping for funny ways of death ?
Like flipping plates of food onto the ground ?
Guys ! Guys !
INDEED
Rex : Not just TV !
BUT LIKE , " WOMAN PETE " ? ?
Do we stick with bland dishes , like tofu - style boiled chicken breast ? Do we dive into the deep end of the meat pool and serve up a charcuterie platter of brains and organmeats ? ? DO I DARE SHARE THE SUBLIME BRILLIANCE OF BONE MARROW , KNOWING IT WILL FOREVER CHANGE HER LIFE ? ?
To which I will reply , " Look at yourselves ! Who is the REAL monster , my friends ? "
Yes , OBVIOUSLY . And my AI will play these games and eventually see that war is futile ! The only winning move , it will realize , is to just answer my friggin' email .
Ah , yes . Time for some delicious apple juice !
Oh man , your metaphor fell apart there huh ?
Yeah , but they'll still die eventually ! All that's changed is that NOW your sweetie has to care for the plants until then , as they represent your relationship in much the same way the flowers did !
Well , what's your name then ? If it's " Grand Theft Zoosmell " then my friend , panel 3 is the panel for you !
Huh ! I guess you do seem A LITTLE unflappable .
POSSIBLY
And I , my friend , was referring to the chess prodigy known only as " The Ref " !
It's SO BAD .
Because unless someone's mass - producing magic lamps I can accidentally rub to have my wishes LITERALLY BECOME TRUE AS I SAY THEM , I think we as a people can PROBABLY stop warning each other about the proper safety around MAGICAL ARTIFACTS WHICH DO NOT ACTUALLY EXIST . Wish for whatever you want ! And let me know if you find any ACTUAL IMMORTAL GENIES WHO CAN ALTER THE FABRIC OF REALITY , but only if some random schlub asks them to .
Man ! I was SO SAD for SO LONG !
Oh ! That makes sense because I don't have a son .
Rude , my friend !
Well , if you'll excuse me , I'M off to go eat parts of a cow and feel even MORE justified than normal , thanks ! !
Oh , I get it . You want VEGETABLES .
WHAT IS THIS
I came up with a way to get my skateboard treadmill to work !
Similarly , I don't know how to turn wool into felt and on closer inspection I'm not ENTIRELY sure that's where felt comes from in the first place . Clearly , I'm not a guy who cares about making felt and / or specific historical times !
Why can't I say two things at the same time ? I've tried just now and all I got out of it was a passport stamped for FAILURE TOWNE .
I'm tired of movies and plays and radio dramas in which all the characters have such snappy dialogue !
Utahraptor : I ACCIDENTALLY WROTE AN NES GAME IN BINARY WHILE TALKING ABOUT MYSELF . The odds of that happening are ASTRONOMICALLY small ! ! My Week must really have been something !
Spoil the whole story for me as well as every other narrative in time why don't you ? ?
Time to talk about everyone's favourite topic . . .
In my new video game , you control a lady named " Mary Oh " . She's of Chinese descent , which explains her awesome name ! But her boyfriend has been kidnapped !
HI , CAN WE SKIP AHEAD TO THE PART WHERE WE'RE FRIENDS ? ?
Oh well ! You have amnesia , so I guess that's OK .
What did you have in mind to leave behind to make people say this ?
Oh , it's true ! If it was even MARGINALLY in style , I would grow mutton chops .
So yeah , if you're wondering what happened in " The History of Cardenio " then KEEP WONDERING , because none of us kept a copy around . When we were done watching the play we all said " Neat " and then forgot about it forever . When the actors were done they all said " Cool " and threw their copies in the garbage . And then they died years later and their last words were " Forsooth ! Nobody ever asked me to recite my part of Cardenio from memory , OH SNAPS . "
Um , say what ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
HAVE YOU EVER FAKED IT DURING SEX COMICS
What about the alveolar part though ?
CITIZENS ! YOU HAVE ABUSED THE POWER OF BINGO , AND WE BINGO - POWERED CYBORGS ARE THE PRODUCT OF YOUR BINGO - POWERED HUBRIS . GUESS IF WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY ALL ORGANIC LIFE !
It's not my fault !
UTAHRAPTOR
Ten .
Because say I travel to the future and take back some sweet future technology : let us say , hoverbikes . Nice ! And then people in the present can examine the hoverbikes and see how they work to duplicate them , which is also nice , until we get to the future and the guy who invented hoverbikes won't do it anymore because they've already been invented ! He doesn't want to be a copycat . Assume for the sake of argument that he doesn't want to be a copycat .
I don't want to hang out the ENTIRE time , T - Rex , I just want quality time when we DO hang out . I need quality , not just quantity !
So I was TOTALLY partially right ! That's EXCELLENT .
People say to me , " T - Rex , what do you want for Christmas ? " This year I have the perfect gift idea !
Awesome inflation !
Okay okay - so there's been a lot of people born , right ? In the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born . So the question is , are there enough people in the world that I could write out a story . . .
Come on , people . COME ON . How is this a problem ?
Or predisposition , anyways . The point is that this hot weather makes me feel great !
I guess not , except for the fact that the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance is a HIGH SCHOOL BALL and not a wedding !
And wizards cast spells orally !
And the first sentence is " We hope this will be the start of a beautiful Relationship " ?
You read a story and it's like , " Hey ! Here's a bunch of fake stuff that didn't happen ! "
Today I made peace with the possibility that MY cause of death might not be listed as " kung fu " .
OH MY GOSH , CAN YOU IMAGINE ?
Please don't stomp on 'em , T - Rex !
I was going to retort , but suddenly I realized I couldn't see any way that would increase my Boinking Potential !
Well , these kids couldn't !
People who've made bad decisions : I salute you !
All I know is stair junk now ! !
Science is really popular so this makes sense .
" Champing at the bit " ? HORSES . " Betting on the wrong horse " ? HORSES . " Driving across town to pony up some money to a woman in ponytails " ? T - REX , 3 HORSES TEAMED UP IN THAT SENTENCE .
Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman !
Dude , what if the green I see isn't the same green that YOU see ? We could all be seeing different colours , and maybe that's why we all have different favourties !
No real reason ; I've just been looking for a chance to work that in for a while
The TRICK is to put all the vegetables into one easy - to - make , delicious dish !
Wait hold on what
So what happens next in your alternate history ?
I used to like creative writing
My stomp exhibits far more grace than any other T - Rex ! Just another example of why I'm the greatest !
COMICS WHERE THE PUNCHLINE IS " NO THANKS , CHUCKLES "
Turns out he's got competition !
Yep this is definitely a fact ! Heads up , everyone !
. . . Wow . That's really intense .
Oh crap I almost forgot about that part ! ! After he stopped explaining about copyright , Popeye punched Sherlock Holmes ! " Elementar - - eeeee ! " yipped Sherlock as he was punched mid - word .
Done with which conversation , T - Rex ?
Stop stomping on things !
Yes ! LET US .
I'll have a fun time learning about ACCOUNTING BEST PRACTICES !
Though you raise a good point ! Remember : cartoon planes can be added to ANY shot in film . In the vast majority of cases this only increases audience engagement . THE END .
Sherlock Holmes adjusted the course of the starship with some satisfaction .
You throw your tears away ?
WHILE FACTUAL , THAT'S NOT A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR WASN'T ACTUALLY IN PLACE FOR THAT ROLLOVERRRRR
you mean i'm doing that wrong too ? oh goodness , i must be the worst zombie going . plus that book i got from the centre is way overdue !
Wait , that's a real animal ? !
Yeah ?
You know what ? Maybe Leibniz is right and we're all doing pretty okay . maybe this IS the best of all possible worlds !
Here there would be some ominous music - FOR WILL THE GIRL SURVIVE ?
If they ened up inside our stomachs , we could eat anything we want and not get fatter ! !
I renamed it to " The Oral Overflow "
Yes ! Maybe if you stopped leaving your used - up socks in the kitchen or whatever ?
Yes I do , T - Rex !
There are many kinds of grief , so I've focused on a particular flavour . When , say , a big meteor hits a dude square on the head and kills him , that's sad . HOWEVER , at the same time , it's also extremely amazing and awesome . It can be hard to reconcile these two , conflicting , emotions .
I have come up with the ULTIMATE COMEBACK to be used on musicians ! All I have to do is wait for one to put me down , and then I can be all :
Hey , can I get in on this prank too ?
T - Rex , stop . Just stop . Nothing you say can ever justify that FAKE TAN .
It's a popularity contest ! WORLDWIDE ! !
Well , if you're talking to us , you COULD casually mention that , incidentally and by - the - bye , you would very much hate being held hostage at the old abandoned slipper factory .
You freak out and try to leave but you're tripping on many balls ! !
Like , say , SEXUAL ATTRACTIVENESS ? A lawyer can practice law , but a lawyerkapow can practice law AND looks super hot doing it ! !
Today . . .
Utahraptor , that's SONG RACISM ! It is too a real song .
Either is acceptable .
Well , that solves my email problem , but leaves me with . . . an endless stream of interpersonal issues ? ?
I have made another exciting music - themed discovery :
P . S . YOU'RE THE YELLOW DINOSAUR , I'M THE T - REX .
T - Rex ! Exciting news !
Well , maybe " whoah , frig , dude , how did you cure all diseases ? "
I COULD get some pretty kick - ass glasses . Like glasses that say " WARNING : AWESOME DUDE " on them ! OOH , or horn - rimmed 60s housewife glasses ! Sweetness !
Oh man , I ate too much last night .
A chartreusey shade of puce ?
It's actually Friday , T - Rex .
Most people agree that a 26 - year - old should be able to consent to sex , while a child should be protected from sexual predators , but where we legally draw that line is contentious ! Some places allow 12 - year - olds to consent to sex , while others believe that even people in their early twenties are unable to give knowledgeable consent to the INTERCOURSE .
You will not learn if they're being changed by others .
I still think your name's rad though
It's been what - four thousand years of civilization ? Five thousand ? How come we haven't solved all the problems and answered all the questions ?
Well , I don't see why not .
To lose weight , ensure your caloric input is LESS than your caloric output for the day .
I think I just ruined myself for every other woman .
That's cause it's got rockets !
Only the BEST NARRATIVE OF OUR TIME !
I know ! I SERIOUSLY WANT TO BE THIS DUDE .
That one .
And you really want to be CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED about where your limbs are when you can't see them ?
And people who practice medical science are called " medical doctors " . If you want to be a doctor you'll need to learn everything that can go wrong with a body !
This one is all , " Well , it's true for me ! "
Wait , yeah , that one is obviously the one we'll dump .
I would have words with the people in charge of aphorisms !
{ { in italics } } sometimes they curse first
Oh man ! I'd better pull on a sweater and turn up the thermostat !
Go to a wedding and you're liable to hear classical music ! Go to a funeral , what do you hear ?
HUH ? ? ? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THE CONFLUX OF THESE TWO EVENTS ?
Hot Wheels ( TM ) cars !
The North Pole - AKA SANTA HEADQUARTERS - is on ice . There's no land underneath it ! It's ice then ocean then seabed rocks then we're into a science class all about the Earth's core !
Oh no ! Upon inspection it was actually a racist screed that relies on made - up quotes and statistics !
Wouldn't it be pretty okay to travel at speeds FASTER than that of LIGHT ITSELF ? ?
Speaking of which : thanks for the portrait ! It's a very good likeness .
HEY I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN HEAR ME BECAUSE I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY UP HERE ! EAAAAARHOOOOOLE
Can I drink the " spring water " ?
Awww !
. . . Um . Maybe ?
So , if I can summarize : you're mad at a fictional character .
. . . Yep !
CAN I GET SOME TOO
Why do you think that's a problem , T - Rex ?
Fruits are INSANE !
Ok tweens , I'll be your substitute teacher for today !
Assumption : assumed !
Maybe it doesn't happen for you because YOU'RE not a main character ! In the story of life ?
Adult Baby Diaper Lover .
Thanks , computers ! !
It's true ! It's not photosynthesis like plants do , but sun does react with your skin to synthesize vitamin D .
I guess it's worth a try ! On three !
For I too enjoy being smart
" INCLUDES TIPS FOR THE SEXUAL DESIRE DLC ! ! "
1900s : consumer - level airship travel is finally made affordable .
Or rather , it WAS , until Superman pushed the planet slightly away from the sun , reducing temperatures back to their normal levels !
WHY NOT
BOO ! THAT ONE -
Um , lots of the - politics ?
So you were dating the singing frog from Warner Brothers ?
That implies I've got a finite number of days left !
Man , I don't even know what sage looks like ! Is it , like , a leaf ? A seed ? Maaaaaaaan , is it even like a food ?
Not to mention that these same odds apply to every one of your parents and grand - parents too !
I've sometimes wished I was more muscley , but that's nothing , because I could just work out if it was REALLY an issue .
That's not a fair comparison , T - Rex .
Say WHAT ? !
It seems that , once again , I have become privy to guy talk due to conversational negligence ! !
" Shannon " is clearly a corruption of " Miss Hannon " , which is itself a crude combination of " Miss Steve " and " Tabbyhanita " .
I totally went out to fancy dinner with friends last night ! It was a lot of fun and the food was extremely delicious .
If gravity reverses , then matter repels instead of attracting !
Yeah , let's hear your story ! We're all hella prepared for terror and madness .
But your rent money can now build cookie equi - look , can we say " house " and not " cookie " ? This analogy isn't getting us anything .
The snow melts and the ground is spongy and wet and carries this terrible smell of rotting leaves and pickled dog poo
It is entirely analogous to wanting some delicious fried chicken , once every two - thirds of a year .
JUST BE COOL
T - REX'S FANTASY SEQUENCE
Yeah , but then you'd lose the hoy of living your own life ! There'd be no more surprises .
Aha - so when did you stop ? See what I did there ? The question presupposes that you've been punching on children in the past , and goes on to suggest that maybe you're still doing so . It is LOADED like rich uncle Pennybags . From Monopoly ?
Wow , I love this idea of a dog's - eye - view of the world !
NEVER MIND , JUST SAY " OH , WOW WHAT A CUTE BABY ! ! " LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES
You do a profoundly unpopular job . I am sorry to announce that yours is the least sexy job thus far .
And you have him piloting the WORLD'S BORINGEST SPACESHIP . Have you forgotten that without mysteries , Sherlock turns to drugs ? ?
To be made of adamantium and diamonds and then to bench press the entire universe .
Stop eating my food , damn it ! You have the ability to go find your own nourishment !
LATER , T - REX LOOKS AT HIS HANDS !
Ah , friends ! Sometimes they're a lot of fun !
this comic works especially well when framed beside other , more expensive medical degress ] ]
How does that work ?
aww , you guys are my best friends
T - REX LEARNS THIS IS HOW NOUNS ACTUALLY WORK IN GERMAN :
It's named after a particularly striking scene from the book ! We're at a party , and a young man accidentally spills pretzels , as he walks by , into the titular Lady's lap ! She looks up : eyes meet , bosoms - on both sides - heave , passions smoulder , and , perhaps . . . romance blossoms ?
So your idea of happiness is lowered expectations ?
That's a lot of T - Rexes kicking around , cats and kittens !
FIVE DAYS
Who's to say I'm not the only person using the internet ? ?
hee hee !
Archaeologists ARE aware that they're mining a finite resource , and when possible , they only dig a little and leave some for the future . But there are time limits : often they'll be examining a site just before it's dug up for a new building of something , which means this is their last chance to see what's there before it's destroyed . And sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don't dig soon , whatever's there will be lost anyway !
If that were true , why'd he stop there ?
T - Rex , will you be eating salad for dinner tonight ?
You should probably say that , actually .
I object to the fact that this includes chicks , but excludes dudes !
Usually there's some threat that makes things SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE , or a startling revelation that appears at the last second .
What are you up to ?
Sometimes when you love someone a lot , you're willing to say , " I'm pretty sure I'm going to love you until I'm dead , EVEN IF I don't die for a totally long time ! "
You know what ? I'm not even certain if it's possible to travel faster than light . I'm going to ask Professor Science .
Benny , look , you gotta find a better name for that .
And then we all decide to pitch in and take over the ice cream cone factory ?
And then he meets a woman named " Louise Laan " and then they're dating and there's some smooching and romance and it all ends in marriage . The end !
Uh , yes ! That smart insight was exactly what I was going to say , and I was definitely NOT leading up to the conclusion that Mario sucks and should be replaced by ME , T - Rex .
That's just FRUSTRATED EXPECTATIONS . Honestly , why give James Bond a gun that shoots piranhas if he's never going to fire it ? People truly want to see that in action . Also : guns that shoot chainsaws .
AND HOLD UP A SIGN THAT SAYS " ANYONE WHO JUST WANTS TO FRIGGIN' PARTY "
Rachel was trying , and failing , to fall asleep . In desperation , she finally said " Body , I'm in control , and I say : SLEEP . "
But your body changes all the time !
But aren't you forget about 1 1 / 2 teaspoons of turmeric and about a half a teaspoon of salt ?
I MEAN
Colon dash openbracket space , period underscore period , diary .
1940s : America's seniors begin dabbling in the occult , creating unnatural birdlike creatures that speak in the voice of a corpse . 1950s : one " Irene " got real sleepy , fascinating the nation .
Hey , what are you thinking about ?
Would you say you can distinguish between good and bad sex ?
I heard it was real ! !
Well , it does if you say it in a dog voice .
Never lose a baby !
That's true ! I just wish we knew more about the man , you know ?
For such a skilled dinosaur as myself , it should be simple !
I'm already gay .
Not bad , not bad !
TODA'YS FILM : JURASSIC PARK II
No worries . I am not Godzilla . It's me , T - Rex !
Thank you ! I did only what came naturally to me .
My name is T - Rex and I'm here to say / I'm really having a pleasant time today ! My flow isn't stale like day - old bread /
thank you
Maybe we should've fixed 'em like hundreds of years ago , huh ? ?
Oh boy ! Emails !
Just curious ! I've never done any , but some of my friends have . They say - they say it's pretty alright ?
He cornered the market on the fabric !
Okay , but no way can you describe the sex itself ! Different body parts come into play .
Hello ! How do [ you do , ] cities ?
WAIT , THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM ! !
T - Rex ?
If you can't afford to eat or buy diapers for your child and then you can , that money will make you happy and have obviously bought you happiness !
Just like " 2oig3nt2as2y " which is a word I just made up that means " annoying to say " !
Attention world ! Who wants to come over and help me celebrate . . .
I know , I know ! But he's a funny guy , right ? And I was thinking : maybe if I told his jokes , I could get inside his head and understand how he comes up with them . Act like Seinfeld in order to become Seinfeld , you know ?
Wait , did I say " awesome " ? ! I meant " HOLY COW < SO TERRIBLE ! "
Hello ! We are friends on Facebook and I kinda actually have no idea who you are . You invited me to a party in a distant city , soooo . . . is that where you live ?
Everyone I've ever kissed is AWESOME !
Probably it's safe to eat chalk ?
They're cheezed - off ghost kids who just want to be buried properly . And if you encounter one , it hops on your back and demands to be taken to the nearest graveyard . And as you approach the graveyard they grow heavier and heavier , until they're so heavy that you can sink into the ground under their weight . And if that happens then they kill you in a rage and try again with the next guy !
It was rough friggin' times for anyone who'd gotten used to being alive !
I am indeed ! Or at least , I was indeed , until I realized that you could just make your own with just a little fabric paint and a working knowledge of what dollar signs looks like .
ooooooo Rain is another 90s hit I really enjoy
I WOULD TOTALLY BE DOWN WITH THAT . I lose like eight hours of productive time A DAY whenever I have to go lie down and close my eyes and hallucinate for a while . Is it truly possible to level up and have a fully functional life while sleeping , so that I can wake well - rested and discover that , OH SNAP , all my problems were solved by Sleepytime Rex ? And also that I sent out some emails ? . . . And had sexy times ?
I know , eh ?
Scarred nerve tissue doesn't transmit signals well !
Come on , T - Rex . That's plagiarized . That's a Jerry Seinfeld joke .
Yes ! The moon ! There's no air up there so it makes sense that he ends up asphyxiated .
You should be happy for him ! He has found happiness in a relationship with a woman he respects , and they don't do anything they might regret before they get married !
I mean no ! It wouldn't be lying : it would be REINVENTION . I would be the Star Trek : The Next Generation to my present " original series " .
Sweet ! We're all friends , and super friends at that , which I guess really just goes to show you that you don't need conflict to drive a narrative .
Is it ?
But we CAN make an educated guess , and with so many choices that could've gone differently , the odds that anyone's doing the one thing they'd be best at are vanishingly small .
* sniff * - It's so beautiful
Who could forget ?
Robot suits ?
It's so great , Dromiceiomimus ! When you finally rescue the prince ( ss ) , he or she turns to you and says " THANK YOU FOR RESCUING ME . NOW , AM I A MAN . . . OR A WOMAN ? "
I believe this is called " nihilism " .
And maybe you could learn these jobs to create the world's most impressive r ? sum ? ?
* Oh no ! *
Well , even if it's an act , at least you're pretending ! Tons of folks won't even do that .
It's a dating profile for me , using a picture taken through my kitchen window . My hair colour is given as " bald but kool " , my age as " about my age , I'd say " , and my interests as " spouses " and " ASCII art thumbs up " and then the rest of my profile is this enormous ASCII art thumbs up .
Dude . IT WORKS BOTH WAYS . You can take a naked selfie and it'll convert that to " Sounds good , let's follow up next week . "
Then you bring it all to a boil , reduce heat and let it simer for 20 minutes !
Spurred by an insatiable need to better myself , I have taken up a new sport !
What ? For reals ?
You're ruining the book for everyone , T - Rex !
They'd say " Thanks for answering my question ! "
These coloured lights we're under make you look green and me orange ! This is a relief , as our regular colour are so flabbergastingly insane that to gaze upon them is to be consumed by gibbering madness .
Dear audio diary ! It appears I have a choice : either I am a guy who doesn't know his history , or I HAVE SOMEHOW ENTERED INTO THE VERY ALTERNATE REALITY I CREATED .
Hmmm . . . Hey God , have you heard this one ? " A horse walks into a bar ! He causes a commotion and T - Rex becomes a millionaire ! ! Also all the sexies like him ( " sexies " is my word for sexy people ! ) "
LATER
today's songs :
Where does the poop - go ?
YOUR BODY NO LONGER EXCITES HER
I hate to say it , but ?
ELECTION COMICS FOR REAL THIS TIME
Oh yeah ! But there's still cake for us , right ?
WHAT CAN I SAY
You can't stop the rock , can't stop the rock ; you can't stop the rock , can't stop the rock ! !
Utaught me how to be a stupid jerk !
Hello ? ! This is not a surprising moral ! History is also like twenty kinds of racist !
Here Lies T - Rex : Hey I Bet He's Still Wicked Handsome !
Don't I know you from somewhere ?
Well as none of us can get pregnant because , oh hey , we're not female mammals , it's not something I'd expect you to worry about ! " I'd never want to be a dividing cell , because there'd be two of me and we'd be tiny . " & # 8212 ; T - Rex .
Well , Dromiceiomimus , that IS an interesting question ! A few years ago I would have said " none " , but now I'm not so sure ! In a way , our bodies do affect who we are : if you've got a strong body , you can be a different person than someone in a weaker body . Trivially , a weak - bodied person wouldn't make a good bully !
And people who pronounce wash as " WARSH " ?
You've long ago segued from being oddly defensive about everything to being oddly OFFENSIVE about everything , pre - emptively addressing any criticism you imagine you might one day receive with an attack ! And we're all sick of it ! Talking to you isn't a relaxing experience , because we're all worried about messing up and ending on your enemies list !
also i don't really like the taste of alcohol
* sniff *
Aw geez . Okay .
But * I * didn't choose seventeen randomly ! It's . . . .
Oui oui tout le monde - et ca n' arret pas ! !
I have led my life believing that people who write down cuss words have bad things happen to them .
I have gained access to a cake ! !
But T - Rex , is it not ENTIRELY TRUE that these rides are illegal ?
I can make tomorrow totally awesome !
That's a little disrespectful , plus , that don't hunger for living flesh .
To summarize : the THRUST of what I'm saying is -
Because if its the former then may I just say : AWESOME
In history times , kites were the highest things around . This was before clouds existed , because there weren't enough of us around then for our exhaled breath to form them !
A place where owls rule the world like they don't even care ?
And you're using " derogatory " in a complimentary sense ?
ok then , chillin' , chillin' , mindin' my business
This is a good thing ! Stupid problems , like " I bought too much mayonnaise " , are easy to solve . ( The solution is to give away , return , or consume the extra mayonnaise . )
I hope you like disappointing sequels !
Playing " the boy who cried wolf " with The Devil !
Long , difficult tasks can be easily avoided by simply not taking that initial and deceptively - simple step .
I guess he wasn't that big of a jerk , huh ?
Heads up !
But I thought you were the one who wanted to negoti -
But here's the thing : snails that do this are NATIVE TO GREECE : the same place CUPID comes from ! It's entirely possible we imagined Cupid up after watching these snails stab each other right before boning . And that's how one of our oldest and most central love metaphors is based entirely on horny snails .
Listen , if sentient puppet kings and portals that work everywhere and not JUST on special walls are on the coming - soon list , I may be willing to cut out SOME red meat !
Aw man , who peed on my couch ? I bet it was Fubs ! !
T - REX WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE SHADE OF BROWN
I'm not convinced that's fair , T - Rex !
Sweet ! Okay , so the idea is , there's this guy , Lee , right ? One day he gains SUPER POWERS . And I'm not sure how he gets them yet but BASICALLY he's got this slot in the top of his head , and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot , so he gains those qualities ! So say a decision has to be made : he writes " decisive " on a card and forces it into his head , and he becomes DECISIVE LEE ! He then has the power to do things decisively , SUPER decisively !
Oceanic levels dropped back to normal levels , and everything was great until we noticed how greenhouse emissions were causing warmer temperatures . The fate of the world again hangs in the balance !
Well , what do your rooms look like ?
Apparently not dude !
And then it starts to get more advanced , encoding mathematics !
- - or a best friend who can tell interesting stories without making them science fiction author insertion epics ?
T - REX THIS TALK IS LIKE ESTATE , LIFE , MADRID , AND GHOSTBUSTERS :
You don't like history ?
Will I be allowed to touch the nostrils afterwards ?
Man , I don't count ! I was talking about OFFICIAL visits to the moon . Mine were in a strictly unofficial capacity .
Yeah ! You can't have thinking in a vacuum , so SOMETHING must exist if there's thinking going on . . .
Guess I need to search the internet before doing ANYTHING , huh , just in case it's been done before ? Better look up every sentence I ever say , just in case I'm ripping someone off ?
TIMELESS AGES LATER :
Maybe something that used to work won't work anymore !
Heh . I never noticed before , but they are kinda cute .
Oh , crap , that's just because I wasn't using my reading voice . One sec .
Exactly . Sucks to that !
Cette danse n'est pour tout le monde , c'est SEULEMENT pour les personnes sexuelles .
The Towne takes up most of the island , so they share the same name ! His mailing address : ULTIMATELY ADORABLE . I love my little elephant friend !
Turns out the level 3s were basically well - adjusted people , and level 4 bird ghosts were beings of enlightened truth whose merest glance drew tears of joy . THE END . The moral of the story is , I'm not really sure how guns work ?
The Minbari ? From Babylon 5 ? Hah ! Didn't know you were the " make B5 references a decade after it went off the air " type .
My friend , I don't know much about " Bible " , but that is a way better plotline .
LET ME TELL YOU T - REX
Okay , you know what , at least I'm LOOKING for racism .
And yet , I can't help but feel I'm forgetting something . . .
The BAD news is that they've moved in together next door !
Ha ha ! You know , some people say pi r squared , but I know they're round !
They're . . . pretty okay ?
" Being raped is totally way worse than failing a test . "
In the end , I guess they really had crossed . . . The Bridges of Madison County .
Amazing ! I feel the same way ! !
Dude , that's the book !
It must be dead .
Aw frigs dangs and craps ! ! Circumstances and / or events have made me . . . ANGRY .
Then she used algae to grab all the floating plastics and microplastics ?
I'm also down with fall , T - Rex !
My brain rejects that sentence as semantically invalid !
T - Rex rules the schools !
Be excellent to each other !
WAIT IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA ASK
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ME GETTING FRIGGIN ARRESTED BACK THERE
COMICS IN WHICH T - REX OWES UTAHRAPTOR FIFTY BUCKS
So that's it for arguing about religion ! Can't verify faith !
Who is in charge of deciding whose face gets to be put on the money ?
" Complement " had an " e " there , T - rex , not an " i " .
ONE DAY :
Some women find that sexy .
Then you'll love my story about squabbling roommates named " You " , called " You can't take it with You ! "
You want to be another Mona Lisa !
I don't know what to tell you , my friend !
Tada ! !
Go naked !
I might go as " PLATONIC LOVE " .
OKAY . In my new alternate history , everything is the same , except for one pertinent detail :
Sure ! I will simply freeze TIME ITSELF .
Bisexuality can lead to all sorts of new and exciting self - labels ! Labels like " biknowledgeable " ! " Bisensitive " !
It's not just that jokes get dated , but that whole standards for comedy shift , I think . Stuff that was edgy fifty years ago is old hat today ! We can recognize HOW it was supposed to be funny , but there's comedic writing from a hundred years ago that goes right over our heads today , simply because we don't have the cultural context to recognize that jokes are being made , that parody and satire are taking place . Ouch for those guys ! Ouch for us in 200 years !
In retrospect , there already were some serious concerns with how my day was going
No . My friend , I propose nothing less than CONSPIRACY .
What was an angry prohibitionist chicken - rights activist doing in a bar , anyway ? !
Hey , T - Rex , did you drop your wallet in my -
That's not him ! He'd say " Forsooth " !
The final contestants are Ken Jennings , IBM's NLP computer , and some dude .
Dang , it appears my " this website idea only seems dumb because I haven't said it out loud yet " theory is an unmitigated fiasco .
Only because I always reserve point five for emergencies ! !
You mean INTERACTIVE LIES ? ?
Everybody dies .
Maybe a little !
The hospital is a medical doctor ?
" Ironclaw Deathheart , The Final Harbinger of Chaos . "
But we'd be stuck in a certain time period , because people would never die !
And because of that , there's little concern about establishing a legacy . Skills , secrets , inventions and discoveries are jealously guarded , their potential returns stretching out over a lifetime that never ends . In summary and in conclusion , a world where everyone's immortal is bad for everyone !
THAT SOUNDS SHITTY
Yep ! it pulls this off by protecting its repair enzymes from radiation damage , AND by keeping multiple known - good copies of its DNA !
Ah , 'tis something soothing to discover yourself engaged in something you very much enjoy .
Hah ! I SURE have .
Pretty friggin' intense ! !
OKAY LISTEN
And at other times , there's no record of him for years and years !
Not bad !
Hm ?
OUCH
" Life sure is funny sometimes , " Antonio muttered as he slid smoothly out of bed !
THE REASON THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT NOW IS THAT TODAY IS DROMICEIOMIMUS' BIRTHDAY ! SHE IS STILL AS AWESOME AS THE DAY SHE WAS BORN .
Shakespeare , Hamlet ACTUALLY ends on a bus , right ?
Perhaps it's a focus YOU don't have , dude ! You forget that I am extremely intense .
Actually . . . it's a pretty good likeness ?
Whoah ! Ready and able , sir ! !
T - REX
Come on !
Oooh ! Or alternatively , they could also be weed - hungry teens in a comedy called " Those Darn Stoners ! ! "
Dromiceiomimus , If you could have anything in the whole world , what would you want ?
Huh ! Instead of writing " I rode a horse " , I wrote " I wrode a horse " !
I'll say this : it was clever yo make the previous and next books part of your story .
Excellent .
It sounds like we're being forced to accept the classical notion that there never was any objective existence in the first place !
Nope ! If I expose myself I might get superpowers , and would this be unable to focus on giving OTHER people superpowers .
We do EVERYTHING with potable water . Washing dishes in drinkable water : makes sense ! Washing clothes in potable water : maybe , I guess ? But I don't see any reason why POOP WATER should be drinkable . We should be filling our toilets with recycled water that's already been used for washing clothes or whatever !
Utahraptor ! Get over here !
That's really the best you can do ?
I like your name
My name's not important and I'm here to say / That I've been outside rapping for most of today !
I just asked them for a size awesome ! !
It's PROBABLY worth the effort ? ?
Plus , if we dressed up fancy all the time , what would we do for special occasions ?
And then some ! I've been waiting for this game to come out for my entire adult life . Wow .
Maybe she could have been there in the past ?
NO NOT LIKE THE DUCK
Which would you prefer : to have a best friend who , thanks to a stable time loop , has LITERALLY CAJOLED HIMSELF INTO EXISTENCE , or - -
PROJECTED IGNORANCE :
Dromiceiomimus , I know you're vegetarian , but you've been vegetarian since forever . You were ahead of the curve ! But lately everyone ELSE is suddenly like , " Oh , T - Rex , I'm sorry , * I * don't eat pork chops anymore because they're way too delicious . And gosh , no , no , steaks are out too because they don't have any stupid chlorophyll in them ! "
Right on !
Well if you don't like both the existing options AND the constructed ones , what's left ?
Weaponized photons !
Hah .
It may be illegal though !
That doesn't matter !
I do ! Do you , T - Rex ?
hey utahraptor what do you do on a typical friday night ? I need it to be awesome / sexy ! ! ! ! !
They're terrible !
AHHHHHH
Unfortunately , yes !
" T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR " starring t - rex and utahraptor
Well , Henrietta never found out . She was never even told that the cells were being cultivated !
Of course I would !
YES . OMG . THIS GUY IS SO MANLY THAT OTHER MEN WANT TO BE MEN WITH HIM . AHH I CAN'T EVEN DEAL .
Man , you must really like sleeping with the window open , T - Rex !
I LOVE SIGN LANGUAGE TOO
. . . Wait . He rejects the cissexual dichotomy but still subscribes to traditional play gender roles ?
YOU CAN'T
Dude ! I'm trying to make it sound gross !
Wow ! Pregnancy !
In modern times we'd say " Hey ! Screw you too , buddy ! ! " to curse out these jerks , but the Greco - Romans did not mess around . They carved friggin' CURSE TABLETS .
For one , games of hide - and - go - seek would be more complicated . Also if you were a long - distance runner , it would be more difficult to run because when you went faster that light you couldn't see where you were going .
I have no idea what you're talking about !
LATER , A MOMENT OF PERFECT SELF - AWARENESS :
Professor Tyrannosaurus Rex , PhD !
Some men climb mountains , while others split atoms like the gods themselves . All I want to do is get a shopkeep with strong upper body strength to object to my continued presense .
EIGHTEEN HOURS AGO .
And " fallacy " is there because in real life , it doesn't actually rain when I get sad .
JUST STOP MAKING ME REALLY WANT TO READ ABOUT THE POPE SO I CAN UNCOVER MORE OF THESE INCREDIBLE PARALLELS
Oh hey , did you know a pound of corn is about 1300 kernels ?
And whales ARE part of nature .
Well look at YOU , Mr . & # 8220 ; I write a book about a tugboat that employs superseded scientific theories for locomotion & # 8221 ; !
Here are some bad kisses i have had . Boy howdy !
That'd be awful nice of you .
Nopers ! !
Huh ! It seems less cool knowing that it's been done before . But I guess I COULD still visit my grave and pretend to be a time traveler who's changed the past ! The whole " Noo ! I changed the past ! " idea . You know ?
I'm pretty sure it was to avoid these talks ! !
I am drumming up business for myself
Oh crap , you wanted to know about the year 1837 ? Quick , everyone : say everything we've memorized about 1837 !
Oh , it's true ! But I messed up . I'd really prefer losing nociception : the sense of pain !
So true !
That's nowhere near to one of every noun ! What about butts ?
YES . Somebody please slaughter their chickens and cook them and bring them to me and then leave immediately . I WILL PAY CASH MONEY .
Dudes ! !
UNIVERSAL REMOTE : it only works on Earth machines . This is UNIVERSE RACIST . It is a big " screw you " to literally EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE EXCEPT EARTH .
A superhero !
EVERYONE
Or perhaps it's hard to admit that hypothetical future people would be more on the ball than you could ever be !
Hello , government ? This is T - Rex on speakerphone . I hereby claim ownership to ALL the other planets ! You can look at them with telescopes if you want .
Hey Ryan !
While riding my bike yesterday and making a TOTALLY LEGAL move from the side of the road into traffic so that I could make a left - hand turn , this car dude honked at me !
Are you not familiar with accent ? Or with addict , combine , conduct , conflict , content , and object ? PERHAPS YOU'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY HELLO TO PERFECT , PRESENT , PROGRESS , REFUND , SUSPECT , AND UPSET ?
x get cool bedsheets
Baby , it's like you read my mind !
T - REX WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THE UNIVERSE WAS JUST A TEST TO SEE IF " SANDWICHOCRACY " AND " SANDWICHTASTIC " WOULD EVER BE USED IN A SENTENCE
A COMIC WITH FUNNY JOKES
Somebody's in here ! ! !
You know , there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas !
Your dog is a golden retriever . Please say hello !
WHO CAN SAY ? ?
No , for as in most modern Roguelikes , there are unlockables that persist between play sessions .
I KINDA THOUGHT THAT WAS THE REASON WE ALL DECIDED NOT TO LIVE THERE ? ?
Uncanny ! All my memories are flooding back in a torrent of life and history !
Godot ! Where were you ?
Driving is a job that's super boring but that nevertheless requires CONSTANT focus and attention , and if you slip up , you DIE . And do you know what we non - robots are pretty sucky at ?
Would you sew a button back onto one of my shirts ?
I don't know if there is , T - Rex !
You go on to decide I'M doing a friggin' excellent job narrating !
Like a novel ? Or a screenplay ? Or a stage play ? Or a radio drama ? Or a puppet show ? Or a TV pilot ? Or a web series ? Or a comic book ? Or a video game ? Or a narrative epic song ? ?
If I had the means to design and build my own house , it would have all sorts of cool features . Like skylights and sensible door chimes and high counters designed to accommodate my giant frame !
Says me , T - Rex ! Okay , listen , THIS is how you throw your hands up in the air . And watch closely , because I'm only going to wave them all around like I just don't care ONCE .
Yes ! It was awful . . . ly awesome ! !
Okay , well , Nacho got there first and I'll give him that , and sure , maybe adding cheese to an existing food is a better strategy than ketchup . Okay , the Sexy Rex is now when you add cottage cheese to cereal instead of milk . Come over , we'll try it together .
They need explanation ! The best scares are like the best art , where you get it viscerally , without a little placard beneath it that says " OKAY . SO . WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS ALZHEIMER'S . "
You know
So Professor Time invents a new machine , which she eponymously calls her " Time machine " ! And by amazing coincidence it DOES actually allow her to travel through time !
Not hardly !
One of us will win not only $ 1000 dollars of PURE PROFIT , but also the pride of having been totally right for a whole decade ! And the bet ties this elastic band between you and the other party : no matter how far apart you travel , you'll be snapped back together again years later for this - this SETTLING OF ACCOUNTS . I think that's special . I think that's awesome !
Well , we all tend to define ourselves with or against something : a home town seems as good a thing as any !
And there were 2600 athletes at the last Olympics , so with 6 billion of us in total , your odds are 1 in 2307692 of developing such peak physicality .
A negative income tax , or " NIT " , is when the government pays you money when your income is low ! Pretty sweet !
Don't shout " Hey ! GET A ROOM ! ! " at couples kissing . Instead , shout " Hey ! YOU CAN USE MY ROOM IF YOU WANT ! ! "
[ picture ]
I have accomplished much today and it's not even noon yet ! I feel as if I could take on anything and anyone and succeed !
Attention , youths of today ! Did you know that there are several fun experiments you can do at home ?
Well , they spent over five years and fifteen million dollars on it , but in the first and only field test Cyborgocat wandered onto the street , got run over by a cab , and was killed instantly .
Hah ! I DON'T BELIEVE YOU .
So rather than being raised by his butler , Bruce is raised by wild apes !
Is this like in movies , where the nerd realizes snooker is just applied geometry and then is suddenly great at pool ?
Heck if I know , dude !
These are serious fears that will likely haunt you till old age , some of them no doubt blossoming into a startling and varied garden of regret !
Well , as I was saying -
. . . True . Okay , so you get your neighbours to live in the cold for a few weeks too ! And by " neighbours " I mean " the entire city " .
I think sometimes that I am not a very good friend , because I don't have a very good idea of what is appropriate .
Guy gives fire back to mortals , and as punishment by Zeus he's chained to a rock and has his liver eaten by a vulture every day .
Hey , did you know vanilla is the world's second - most expensive spice ?
That's a terrible idea , T - Rex ! How will you be able to trust your results if you recorded them while high ?
He's so terrible at being a ghost !
What about the authors of non - fiction ?
If we're both in a place in our lives that allows it , adult enough to handle it , and both interested in sexing each other up AND down , should we totally give it a try ?
T - Rex , as soon as you place the camera somewhere , you're making a value judgment about what's worth seeing and what's not . You're privileging what's in front of the camera over what's behind it : that's political !
Screw you , comedy !
But moving a planet was akin to creating a global earthquake , causing massive structural collapse .
" Oh hello , Ben Johnson and Christopher Marlowe ! Let's all write Shakespeare plays together . How do you spell 'bodes' ? "
Think of it as broadcasting to the world !
Aww , you're not all bad , T - Rex !
W - water ?
It was so crazy , I don't feel comfortable talking about it .
Dude , " Utahraptor " sounds like " you dah raptor " , like you're alone in the bathroom saying " you dah man " in the mirror each morning . Weak ! !
SERIOUSLY . GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER , PARENTS
AND civilization and , like , medicine ? ?
Rising sea levels were threatening to drown coastal cities : the polar ice caps are melting !
I love you , T - rex !
I think it just extends to pronouns : one of the several reasons you shouldn't call Dromiceioimimus " you babes " !
It is the technology ( and art ! ) of concealing messages from people . With stenography you can pass around SECRET MESSAGES , and nobody except for you and the target will even know the message is there ! FOR EXAMPLE : digital photography ! Pictures use bytes to represent colour data , right ? So all you do is use the least significant bit of each byte as your payload , and tada ! Instant hidden information in any old image !
So you're mining your members for sweet dates ?
And if I do it anonymously , that still lets ME feel good about myself . Alright , what if I rescue someone from drowning ? And I hate the person , so I don't feel good about saving them !
AND EVENTS
What if today really IS your most important day , and nothing memorable happens ?
But you'd be spoiling ( in the movie sense ) your own life !
I HEAR THAT
T - REX GOES TO CHAD'S THING
Does the inanimate object go to jail ?
And , after THAT ended at a sensible hour , I went home and caught up on my correspondence . The next day I checked out some community theatre , and then volunteered at the library !
HEY T - REX
You know what's funny ?
Time for me to learn some new languages ! AS THE OLD SAYING GOES , he who can speak many languages is suspected by his peers to be an ultra super genius times two .
Can't follow what I'm saying so I'll underline it for you / < span style = " text - decoration : underline " > SLAPPED DOWN < / span > is all I really gotta do
. . . my love of George Clooney , that is ! !
a cautionary tale
T - Rex , you're my friend and I respect you , but you're not really ROMANTIC . Romance requires emotional swagger and sensitivity , but you've inured yourself to all but the most amusing of feelings , you know ? You just attract through other means .
In conclusion : your grandma was a peach in life , but in death she's smashing all your stuff up for the lulz , and we just have to accept that .
Normally when this happens , I write back the sender and let them know they've got the wrong address , but this time is different . They sent me four separate sets of baby pictures , covering the first four days of her life ! I've already seen this baby grow up four days ! I have a RELATIONSHIP with her now , and I've decided : I'm in for the long haul .
I have an idea for the ULTIMATE disaster movie : basically , what happens is the Earth stops dead in its orbit one day , and everybody flies into a wall !
Ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever !
Amazing ! We agree 100 % ! !
You own a couch ? !
Alright dudes ! Today is TELL EVERYONE ABOUT ME ( T - REX ) day . It's the day where I finally get tons of new friends ! I will finally be
Please don't get murdered in my bedroom , Utahraptor
I thought that was clear ?
Impossible .
Ah . Well . That was my only objection .
. . . Then you went ahead and lost any specialness from that a second later when someone else was born . Nice one .
Hmm . What's brilliant is I could run it in reverse and REMOVE crappy puns from anything . Oh man , it could be an email plugin ! OR BETTER : a cochlear implant ! !
So , why are we SO CONCERNED if something is good or not ? It's relative ! It's an OPINION . We should judge things by something we can objectively measure : POPULARITY .
ENDING FIVE
I would've thought you'd call it " T - Rex's condition " or something !
Is it possible to have too many friends ?
T - REX THAT IS THE WORST ANSWER THAT HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN TO THAT QUESTION
WHAT YOUNG T - REX THINKS ADULT LIFE WILL BE LIKE :
ANOTHER TIME GINGER PEANUT SOLVES AN ACTUAL MYSTERY BY ACCIDENT AND THE MAYOR GIVES HER A BRAND NEW MAGNIFYING GLASS IN THANKS
This is a laundromat , sir !
RADICAL .
And as saying that things get hotter the higher up you get is incredibly naive ( how come mountain tops aren't sweltering ? ) , Icarus was fine . Temperature actually DECREASES as you go up the troposphere , and there's no way Icarus could fly up to the thermosphere , where things DO get hot , because there's just not enough air .
Okay .
Whatever . I'm outta here .
You should write a book then . I wish you luck .
Nope ! What I didn't realize was that people have different tastes .
Aww ! Shooting down my ideas ?
NAILED IT
The Whiz !
Sure man , all the time !
And it's happening RIGHT . . .
Oh ! Yeah , it was nice . We had " chai " tea .
I really want to hear more ! !
Tip number one is to have a good email address !
Hey is there any way we can get a larger selection of genital down here ? These ones are getting booooring !
Accordingly , he kills his son , chops him up , and makes him into stew !
Why wouldn't I ?
Okay , I vote for the database one !
Or they could simply deduce that someone collected these things from the past !
You sure did ! Dromiceiomimus and I are going ! You should come . You should come because the kangaroo is going to solve his problems with his fists , and when he's done his problems are gonna be solved RIGHT IN THE FACE .
Hallowe'en is over but I'm still without clothes !
Hey , maybe the ancient Greeks all died out and evolved into current Greeks PRECISELY BECAUSE they didn't have a word for " sandwich love " ? ?
If you accept that , oh heck , we're just going to kill each other sometimes and there's nothing we can do about that , what does that say about us ?
I think that comedy goes bad after a while ! I don't think I've EVER laughed at a joke that's more than two hundred years old .
I ask you to withhold judgment !
Utahraptor , that's all well and good but I've got some secrets I can't see myself sharing ! For example , and I never thought I'd ever tell anyone this , but , well , this one time -
My boy , when you're my age , you get to call all sorts of things all sorts of things !
Wow ! Where'd you guys pick up English ?
Okay , so here's the plan ! I send cards to all my friends giving them the first clue on a treasure hunt !
When he arises , inform him his friend Doug would have words with him .
Well , it's not just about blame or credit , T - Rex , it's also about free will !
He goes on to say that he regrets the pun , but it's the most appropriate word ?
FATALISM COMICS
No way , man ! The Genesis was the best console ever !
And he says , " Because I'm going to stub you on the coffee table later ! "
They've got nothing else to do there all day , so they invented cement .
MMM SALUTATIONS T - REX
Hmm . . . sounds to me like somebody lost their last few friendships !
" Bookkeeppaaddrringo , right ?
You don't need kids of your own to take a particular , direct interest in other people's little ones .
It's a total Pok ? mon rip off !
YAWN
Turns out that Bachelor Chow exists ! All you need to do is eat . . .
Such beauty
" Bogus " ?
Uncle Chris then spoke to Robyn at length about how he doesn't like her friends and how her clothes are too immodest and how the video games she plays on her phone are turning her into a crazy killer like in the newspapers . " OH MY GOD , " Robyn said , " IT'S LIKE - - I DON'T - - YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHITTY THE GAMES I PLAY ON MY PHONE ARE " .
I wouldn't put it that way !
Sexual ambiguity !
Oh my god , do you think we know each other ?
Do you remember when we used things like commas and periods and question marks
Except you didn't rate her a perfect ten .
- it's the number of times I have thought about ice cream today , I'm not even gonna lie
THE ULTIMATE STORY FOR MEN
What's past " XXX " ?
No no , that one is entirely great too !
DO NOT BE FOOLED
And we multiply that number by the unfortunate chance someone will witness their parents become the victims of violent crime as a child !
Chip , quantum physics allows the collapse of particle superpositions from high - energy nonlocalities , which can result in emergent , time - symmetric , non - deterministic behaviour .
In fact it can !
I look forward to it .
Because I've realized : it takes time for my eyes to react to light , too !
T - REX WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR OBITUARY TO SAY
You're right ! I had lost my way .
Aw , come on ! There's strawberry frosting all over " As You Like It " !
NAZI ACCUSATIONS
Oh . Hey , Dromiceiomimus .
Red is on her way to visit her grandmother , who lives in the woods . She meets a wolf and tells him where she's going , so Wolf gets there before her and murders the grandmother . Then he DRESSES UP IN HER CLOTHES while BOTTLING HER BLOOD AND CHOPPING UP HER FLESH . Then he gets into her bed .
Today , my friend , I choose pessimism !
Give it time !
Sup , T - Rex !
EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE A DOG IF YOU SAY IT IN A DOG VOICE ! !
Listen , I'll talk to you later .
It's neat how most of our key verbs are just one syllable long ! I think that verbs we use a lot change to short words with time , since if they did NOT , it would take a real long time to say all the run - of - the - mill thoughts we have !
Terrific , right ? Every time we love something we know we're setting ourselves up for one of two conclusions : we'll eventually feel grief when that thing is gone , or maybe , just maybe , we'll DIE FIRST and leave everyone else to feel grief instead .
Secretariat could've been called " Captain Hoofface " or " Ol' Bladder Splatter " , but instead we get the eminently classy " Secretariat " . Equestrians could marvel at the amazing finesse of the great " Hoofs Ahoy ! All Aboard the Hoofs " but no : SECRETARIAT .
is it because he's on the cover ? that's the only reason i can think of
Okay okay : " Here lies T - Rex / Or at least his body / We found it over there "
1 ) aim directly at face 2 ) read using eyes and brain 3 ) enjoy !
I wonder , what's the best thing that could happen to me today ?
What ? No , the dream is still alive ! I'm going to move to a new town and REINVENT MYSELF . A fresh start !
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DIE
So ! Depression ?
a " PG - 13 " picto - story
EVERYTHING , yo ! She knew every of the things .
Guys I think I hit my head
I'm still thinking about it years later though !
Instead of looking for dates , you could scour your memories for missed romantic opportunities !
Granted , that's the best possible scenario .
Again : as this list is 100 % accurate , no debate will be tolerated .
Before you can say anything , a giant meteor strikes the earth ! The impact wipes out 65 % of all life on the planet , including your own . Better luck next time ! THE END

Dromiceiomimus , did you know that Dinosaur Present Day , Featuring T - Rex , is coming up ?
COMICS WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN GENRE
You WANT your actions analyzed . You want it because if a third party analyzes them , not only does that suggest they're interesting , but it also gives them intrinsic meaning : there must be something there worthy of analysis ! You never have to worry about living a meaningful life if there's someone else to find meaning for you .
HINDUISM COMICS !
God ! We're going to steal the kilogram !
Balderdash !
I am indeed god at stomping on things !
These prices are estimates anyway , dependant on so many assumptions . Even if someone's dead , you can't say for sure how much they're worth ! How much was Newton worth ? Or Shakespeare ? Or some dude who fathered Shakespeare's great - great grandmother ? Or some OTHER dude who was there , encouraging him to do it ?
WAIT NEVERMIND THAT'S AWFUL
Sorry ? I said the SNES was the best console ever because I never had one and they looked fun !
WELL HOLD ON TO YOUR BALLS CAUSE WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT WAS OUR UNIVERSE ? ?
I GUESS THAT'S WHY DOGS USE THEM , HUH ? ?
Wait a minute . WAIT JUST A MINUTE . If you're just reading ahead to get to the good ending , then you are cheating and need to go to back to panel 3 , but this time replace " going to " with " ( as punish - ment ) not going to " .
SERIOUSLY ?
Clever !
Excellent ! I'M going to shoehorn my own politics into your tale , reducing you to a mere representation of Heidegger and the story to transparent lecturing in which characters often break the fourth wall to tell my readers what they should believe !
Gosh , I'm sorry - I was just on my way to the grocery store . Some other time , OK ?
I am love and humility !
COMICS FOR ASEXUAL CHICKS AND DUDES !
Incredible ! What's the future like , T - Rex ?
I may have been too hard on evolution the other day . The fact that plants have photosynthesis IS pretty awesome !
But - I suppose it's not quite as bad as all that , since different people DO have different tastes . What was the name of this show you liked so much ?
THIS'LL BE GREAT TELL HIM A SKELETON WENT INTO A BAR AND ORDERED A BET AND A MOP
I say we adopt some new metaphors , cats and kittens ! !
Yeah , what if you were born with a set number of funny jokes , and now you've used them all up ?
Today I'm going to play by my own rules !
My friend ! Such excellent advice is truly as rare , and as welcomed , as the 3UP moon ! !
It's time for . . .
While they evaporate , black holes release only small bits of energy , mainly photons , which populate a near - empty space . All that remains of Creation is a low level of background radiation and a few subatomic particles , scattered across a frozen , silent , and lifeless Universe .
What about it ? ! Grab the ball , try to get to the other side .
How come you love words that make communication difficult ?
Icarus and his dad were imprisoned on an island with water patrols , so they couldn't escape by boat . But they still wanted to escape anyway , so they made wings out of wax and feathers and flew away .
You know what's TRIPPIER STILL ?
Um . . . look , you can't tell ANYONE , but I think the Dromiceiomimus has a crush on me .
Let's imagine I'm Superman ! I go out and fight crime and rescue people from peril . Then I go back to the Daily Planet and work as a reporter !
And Moby Dick takes place in the middle ?
So you're left with paralyzed middle - of - the - road beliefs ?
Anyway , who trusts a Word of the Day chosen by the publisher of a DICTIONARY ?
I'm going back upstairs , it sucks down here !
And . . . SCENE !
YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN NOW OKAY
LATER , BACK AT SEA LEVEL :
Damn straight Dromiceiomimus ! I am recently ALL ABOUT adding " man " in front of things to make them sound all the more manly . You should see me man snooze ! I man snooze with a pure MAN FURY .
That's what I thought !
It felt long too , like maybe I'd been dreaming for . . . SEVEN YEARS ? ?
Yeah , and ALSO , we guys are worried you're going to end up sound patronizing , like you're talking to a dog . " Aren't we just the cutest little puppy ? Yes we are ! Yes we are ! "
People claim to have been sexually assaulted by people who were sleeping .
Honestly , I think your theory is a little pat . It doesn't consider all possibilities !
I don & # 8217 ; t get why you keep insisting Tuggy isn & # 8217 ; t anthropomorphized , but you live him volition . Is he a robot tugboat or something ?
SORRY IT'S NORMALLY BETTER THAN THAT
That one should appeal to about one in then people !
Gross .
Wait , that's exactly what a regular fruit is , nevermind
Nope ! Instead I'll buy new presents and leave those ones as a gift to whoever demolishes the house ! !
" It doesn't matter what others thing about you : it's what you think of yourself that counts ! "
Oh man , I'm still a little tired from last night !
And after she got off the driver who I forgot to give a name to earlier but who I'll now call " Estuary Esquire " , no wait , " Slappy Pete " , asked some locals at a bar about her and they all suddenly got very quiet as they told him that a young woman in a red scarf had died THAT VERY NIGHT , only it was ten years in the past , but the same calendar day at least . Slappy Pete was like " Frick , no way ! "
Facebook Shakespeare is embarrassed and has deleted his profile ! !
Incidentally , I don't have any friends who aren't gendered !
Or what if the next day they answer new calls but you're still left on hold indefinitely , one lone phone line forever in use , forgotten , discovered only years from now when they pick up a dusty phone in some closet and you're all " Oh good , FINALLY ! " ?
You have business cards ?
Here's a credible fact : I have never been near a movie set in my life
Why DO ghosts like mines ?
Perhaps I will not eat my friends after all !
Hello , Dromiceiomimus ! I have a friendship crush on you !
I bet we could just pay someo -
What is it ?
Later , they having some mind - blowing sex AND / OR grow up into cool spies where Nat sneaks in to read documents while Chris transcribes them in safety !
So what'd he do after the parade ?
Easy ! I've mad all the ghosts ghosts of ZOMBIES and WEREWOLVES and VAMPYRES and MUMMIES , and then they all haunt the body of Frankenstein !

Yep , that sure would suck !

You mean I can go to Uganda and they'll understand me ?
They soon deduced their duplicates would understand them . . . FEEL them in a way no other man ever could .
Because ROLEPLAY is HARD
For we can always see and feel much that the people in old photos and newsreels
Fine ! Wait - I THINK things are going fine , but obviously I've got incomplete knowledge . Alright , Dromiceiomimus : according to my UNDERSTANDING of the relevant facts - wait , according to my understanding of the facts I BELIEVE are relevant . . .
The news always says , " Up next : what's in your bathroom that may be trying to kill you ! " and then go to commercials . This is psychopathic . I'm the Captain and they don't even want me in Engineering ! They want me on the couch for the next three minutes of ads .

With the right clothes , you can dress up fancy ; you can look both super attractive AND ultimate sexy .
There is no such profession .
UTAHRAPTOR , NO .
" A rose by any other name would smell as sweet " !
But " begging the question " is mostly used today to mean " raising the question " !
AND YOU'RE ALSO USING BROS IN THE GENDER - NEUTRAL SENSE
I think what I like is the fun of going back and finding one event and just flipping it , then reasonably tracing the changes up to the present . It really can be an intellectual exercise ! I also like how alternate histories imply that each of our daily actions could have TIMELINE - ALTERING CONSEQUENCES .
" said Utahraptor , understanding dawning like a real dawn does . "
I was just lingering over breakfast when I suddenly recalled that entire conversation . Isn't that wild ? And I realized that if I told you about it , this could be your vision of tomorrow : future selves recalling the past !
It all started , Utahraptor , when I decided to stop paying bills and instead start offering bribes .
Okay , hold on , hold on !
We're not made of chocolate ! We just eat a lot of it .
Next is degenerate matter , which sounds like it's really horny ! But instead it's found within neutron stars , scientifically incapable of sex .
Most detective stories reveal clues to the reader as they progress through the book , allowing them to unravel the mystery with the characters , and , if they're good , figure out the mystery before the detective does !

Pretty neat I guess , yeah !

" Amelia and Antonio Tony decided to no longer have sex ! This was some pretty exceptional character development . They both said the next few days were going to be intense . They said this during their now - copious free time . "
Time machines are a special case . If there is a time machine in the story then a lot of anachronism can be explained by the time machine , and is thus NO LONGER ANACHRONISM .
Trading up religions to Norse mythology forever now ! ! I didn't know DRAGONS were an option !

Time for some funny jokes !
Where did you pick up a word like " whore " , T - Rex ? !
You mean face ?
Nooooooo !
I'm the one who's been working against you in the faculty ! Please accept my apologies , T - Rex !

The Pizza Hole tonight five minutes before their " fill any hole with pizza for $ 10 " promotion ends , got it .
Who can say ?
Dromiceiomimus , pretend that we're dating and talking on the phone , and I'll break up with you , okay ?
True story !
ABOUT ME :
That's stupid .
It's OVER !
What I'm SAYING is that nobody would ever say that . They'd say , " The horse that I raced past the barn has now fallen over " !
- day means that local restaurant that's only open on Fridays and has all the free WiFis is open !
Thank you all for coming : I remind you this meeting is Classified . We begin with an old silk hat , a corncob pipe , a button nose , and two eyes made out of coal .
Ahh ! Oh my God ! THAT WAS NOT EXCITING OR ROMANTIC AT ALL ! !
Dromiceiomimus ! THIS IS ONLY THE THIRD !
DEPRESSION COMICS
A few reasons ! The main one is I heard that genius is the ability to come up with concepts that would otherwise have to be taught , and I'VE TOTALLY DONE THAT . Remember ? Remember Punchette , The Power Punch Bear ?
All you need is practice ! I bet if I practice enough , I could get bif enough to stomp this whole house .
So , um -
Mainly since we've all bee thinking about pizza since I mentioned it !
It's just I'm - I'm pretty sure we do .

Pete writes , " Dear Professor Science , we never got to hear your answer yesterday . Is the moon slowing down the Earth ? Best regards , Pete . P . S . : T - Rex is a bad delivery person for mail . "
LATER : EVERYONE GETS TIRED OF T - REX'S " WE " AND DECIDES TO HANG OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE
Because we're all different species !
Sorry T - Rex ! NOT INTERESTED .
Hah hah hah
INDEED ! !
For one , it means if I think I'm awesome , no - one can dispute it because I'm the authority !
Figured I'd be a little more like our mutual friend , you know who !
So I've got this computer problem and I can't figure it out . Half the time it boots up it find the sound card , but half the time it doesn't ! Aren't computers deterministic ?
A major area of computational linguistics is that of " ambiguity resolution " . It turns out that many things people say in a language - English , for example - can have more than one meaning !
Except zombies !
How does it restrict creativity ?

Turns out I buy the drained and pre - sliced bodies of family members to put on SANDWICHES . I eat their UNFERTILIZED EGGS for BREAKFAST . My aunt keeps family members trapped in a backyard pen as a HOBBY ! !
It takes DECADES ?
Game over , man !
The second law of thermodynamics has reached its ultimate expression , and all energy is evenly spread across the Universe . How did this happen ? Stellar formation peters out and the remaining stars use up their hydrogen fuel , burning out . The universe darkens . Trillions of years pass , and practically all remaining matter has been sucked into black holes . Some hold the remains of entire galaxies .

Plot twists are when you think the murderer was the cape guy , but then it turns out . . . .
I have had a revelation ! I am wasting my time trying to discover one ultimate essential truth , when really I should be looking for essential truths , plural !
Aww ! You want kids , T - Rex ? They'd be cute !
In living life to its fullest , you have somehow turned into me : T - Rex ! NICELY DONE . I'm still in control of what I do though , so SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW ! !
I feel alot better about the whole thing now .
Well - - good luck !
I won that argument through FEELINGS
I was going to write a science fiction story , but then I stopped . I realized I don't know what science fiction , as a genre , means !
Aw man ! Why people always got to ram their cars into my house ?
I do ! Does anybody else sometimes wish the things they regret had gone differently ?
The problem with Superman , and Spider - Man , AND Batman , and pretty much every other superhero , is that their stories don't have ends . They're all stuck in the same productive age range , 20 - 30 years old , and it's easy to see why !
" A LOG ON THE HEAD "
Your point , T - Rex !
Okay , so Herostratus burned down the Temple of Artemis . But what happened to the other wonders of the World ? My friends , I ask a bold question : indeed , the boldest . I ask the question shied away from by the greatest minds of our age :
" Bidisillusioned ! "
And if solar sails work , THEN SO TOO WILL MY LIGHT CANNON ! I'll just need tons of light
. . . Does this happen in real life ? ?
OHHHHH .
" The whole universe was an experiment to produce the freshest beats possible and yo , I really think we're close " ?
I um , I capitalized the 'T' there , but there's no way you could know .
. . . I forget where I was going with this
Wow , it's great how your mouth movements match your words ! I wish I could take credit for that .
Nice going , Maslow !
Seriously though , there are problems with the analogy .
As a matter of fact , I DO .
Deal !
Your current mood was 'kingly' !
Hah hah hah ! OH WELL !
Ah yes .
Maybe ! I guess nothing's completely original , but I fear that modern media has become nothing more than a recursive loop with no discernible , objective reality !
I submit that there are a finite number of songs ! Therefore , the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility .
This woman in particular wants nothing more than to fall in love with a beautiful and wonderful man , get married , and have children ! The only career she wants is the noble career of RAISING A CHILD RIGHT . But some of her friends question her for not wanting anything more out of life : they don't see being a wife and mother is enough , aaand they kinda think she's wasting her education .
The problem was amplification and getting the two in sync , not that nobody had thought to " cram one into the other . "
After what happened to me last week , I will now wash my hands frequently . I mean , I mean , MORE frequently .
But they can also be entirely free from any quasi - insulting Latinate etymology the other words have . There's people trying to reclaim these currently - taboo words in the same way " queer " was !
Aw man ! What do you want ?
Oh , just " I lost my gloves and ask that the thief responsible should lose their mind and eyes " ; the usual !
Besides , it's not YOUR timeline . It's EVERYONE's timeline . We have to share it .
In fact , I would venture that I am the best at such endeavours !
Oh god
Into the 'bows , I see !
But you know what they all had in common ? We filled them with US . Maybe we should admit that even though we had millennia , we never quite nailed the " living in peace " thing and let someone else have a chance ! Like , oh I don't know . . . SUPERINTELLIGENT ROBOTS ? ?
Hey , T - Rex ?
This is fine . Well , I mean , it's " fine " if you think having your experience of the world coloured by mind - altering chemicals is a " cool " way to go through life . If you think chemicals like serotonin and dopamine are " rad " , please , continue your addictive behaviour by seeking out people and situations that give your brain access to those substances .

" After all , I have now learned from the best . "
I'm just saying ! It would be the worst .
In this example , I mean . In real life I am a charmer , of course ! ! Hah ! I am loveable and trustworthy and good at conversations !
What the heck ? !
But I have an indoors ! !
I'll be OLD , Utahraptor . The Eliza bot I'll hook up to my email should be at least as lucid as I'll be by then ! People will get her responses and say " Huh ! T - Rex sure has gotten good at responding to certain key phrases in my emails ! "
I WOULD LIKE TO EAT THE WINGS OF A CHICKEN !
18 questions asked .
WHAT IF . . . THE FANTASTIC FOUR HAD LOST THE TRIAL OF GALACTUS ?
Wait , that makes you . . . the middle child ?
You're experimenting with using inappropriate verb tenses .
Congrats , Edna . We'll throw the award on your porch .
That was a year ago !
AS SO
Man , nobody wants to hear " A Long December " by Counting Crows passed off as conversation . Yes , that's right ! I've heard the song before ! I recognize your CONVERSATIONAL PLAGIARISM .
Mr Tusks , do you ever get depressed thinking about all the animals we've made extinct ?
Do - do you actually rule the schools at eating Sloppy Joes though ?
No , that was the next thing I tried !
Yeah , they're okay
NO , obviously not !
I - I can still come if you don't stomp on the house .
THIS friggin' guy .
Perhaps . . . ALL the languages have problems ? ?
Unlike all the other Major Crimes , blackmail is made up legal acts , and it's only the COMBINATION of these legal acts that's illegal ! All I'm doing is offering you a lawful service at a price , which you can accept or refuse without correction . The exact same thing happens when a kid offers to mow your lawn , dude !
I have a brilliant idea for revenging myself against TV's Kelsey Grammer . Oh yes .
T - REX I LIKE THIS IDEA SO I WILL NOW SEND IT THROUGH TIME AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE
So you'd move to a new town just to start a life of LIES ?
Only we can't visit these events without being time travellers ourselves .
Dromiceiomimus ! There's no time for talking about FEELINGS now . We're doing an experiment !
This isn't alternate history , T - Rex ! This is alternate history EROTICA .
Oh , it's already begun !
Hey ! When you put it that way , I'm sad and going back to bed ! !
a reprise
Or , does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits ?
. . . on the Internet !
T - REX I NEED A TUTOR WHAT CAN I DO WITH A NEW COMPUTER
No , not really ! It's annoying , insincere , and unattractive ! Nobody likes someone who is controversial just for the attention .
GREETINGS T - REX HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED PLAYING A RAIL SHOOTER GAME
Sorry , Utahraptor , God's hasslin' me . GOD , I said " friendship " at the start of this stupid conversation ! !
I sure friggin' did ! !
Way to be happy # 1 : amnesia ! Forget your problems !
We will fight them on the beaches , Winston Churchill ! ! !
Frig , I think they noticed me ! ! Pretend like we're having a conversation , Utahraptor !
That's so unlikely . It's such a weird thing to worry about .
From bad relationships , obviously !
If it means there'll be more tacos there's a lot I'm willing to do !
OKAY , as revenge for that , I could prank call Dromiceiomimus and pretend that I'm a celebrity she likes !
a comic for dudes and ladies who are newly single and who are like , man , SCREW THIS
THIS WAS MY REALLY COMPELLING IDEA .
a little something
The best dates are the ones where , even if you get arrested , you're still totally gonna do it again .
Looks like nope !
Perhaps the setup is more important than the punchline after all ?
Does anything of substance happen in this story ? Or do we just humor the reader as he or she fumbles through the novelty of this storytelling device ?
Well , isn't this what you wanted ?
it's frustrating
Happy
I'm very selfless that way , Dromiceiomimus .
I'm pissed off , so everybody get out of my way !
Your center of gravity would be all messed up too !
But I thought you were all about going down in history , T - Rex ?
I posted fan fiction epics about Coke and Pepsi getting into slashly H / C frenemy relationships .
Eh ? Because of Bittorrent ?
I ( intend to ) love that one !
" Mangas " is totally acceptable ! Check it out : " I drew the scalpel across my belly , mangas sloshing out onto the floor , wet and heavy . " " As I opened my mouth to scream , mangas spewed out in an uncontrollable bloody torrent . "
That was a hint , Utahraptor . I'm kinda relying on you for posterity here ! I'm kinda relying on you to substitute " today I polished furniture by flexing my abs back and forth " for " today I dropped a barf " .
On the inside it says " MAYBE YOU'RE DUMB INSTEAD ! IF THAT'S TRUE : HAH HAH , CALLED IT "
Oh hey , T - Rex ! Where are you back from ?
The wall hit you , but " decide " is misleading ! The wall didn't make any decisions .
One universe over , people's bodies aren't on teams with their minds . Instead , their bodies actually SABOTAGE them . Different body parts can fail whenever , with this chance of failure increasing over time until it reaches 100 % !
Man , that's the worst !
Honey ! You look pathetic and desperate !
This is the poignant example of the futility of war that we've ever seen ! !
What is ?
You turn to run , hating the strange , corrupt part of you that wants to stay !
Whoah , T - Rex ! Use your indoor voice - you don't have to be so loud !
Hah hah ! Oh , those PROFESSION MEMBERS !
Everything's fine , except now you totally never meet Kayleigh !
Is that why you're on my nose ? To look for food ?
Oh ! Well , thank you !
Uh - ok , I'm a T - Rex , but , uh , all my symbolism is stripped down in exchange for my mindless destruction .
Well , majority rule is sort of the definition of democracy , T - Rex . Not everyone can get everything they want !
And you're concerned because you don't know who you are if you can't even trust your memories , right ?
I feel as if I've spent the past year in some sort of alternate reality ! Indeed , if I were to describe my adventures over the past several months , I would describe them as . . .
Now I'm not saying she's a gold digger either /
On the other hand , I COULD be living on " Awesome People ONLY : The Street " ! Frig ! I can't see any way out of this impasse , Utahraptor !
I should have been more willing to share !
Oh , that's very funny , Utahrapt -
I propose settle this once and for all , TOURNAMENT STYLE !
If you simply say " Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space ! Seconds later , she blasted into space ! " that is not foreshadowing . That is just outstanding space storytelling .
Driving a car ! Uncanny , yes ? Don't worry , there is no invisible car !
Radical !
Okay ! Today is the day for some tips on being romantic !
This - this COULD be what vampires actually do !
Oh , Dromiceiomimus , you've got to save me ! Failing that , tell them my story . Regale future generations with stories of Mighty T - Rex , felled by nothing greater than the common cold . Irony will be my theme , stomping my leitmotif ! !
Okay whatever !
Our dreams
I do but listen I really think powers are more interesting .
D .
IT'S ME GOD
Somebody stole my bike , T - Rex !
Professor Utahraptor , would you care to take the lead ?
oh . I , uh , I sure do like that colour on you Utahraptor !
Check it , Everyone !
Maybe she WAS there , but she died . Cause of death : TERMINAL REALNESS .
That depends on the game !
Oh snap ! Someone's brain is squeezing for a teasing ! It must be
Yesssssss
BOOberry !
You may be surprised to see this comic lying around . I regret to inform you that it was placed here for a reason ! Yes , I'm sorry , sucky roommate , but you are being kind of a sucky roommate .
Okay , but they've probably both felt this way berfore .
only to tell you the truth i'm not all that fine because i've been under a lot of stress lately !
t - rex ! stop stepping on us ! we think you are misogynist
THAT only works if you're euphoric whenever expectations are met .
So her jaws were surging with 1 % of its power and might ?

Yeah ! ! You wanna go see ? The winner has to go up against oranges !

Four hundred dollars for a new freezer ?
Well , we're " dinosaurs " .
Nice one , Paul Grice !
It's modern , AND dark !
That doesn't seem that hilarious , T - Rex !
So I go to the pharmacy and get some fiber supplements because the side of the box says that they " promote regularity " , which sounds good to me ! But it turns out that fiber only makes things worse ! IT TURNS OUT , fiber is actually the last thing you want to take when you have a too much poo problem already !
I know some opinions aren't " popular " , but that doesn't scare me , and I'm gonna say what I REALLY think :
Hey T - Rex , why won't you lend me $ 20 ?
( VIA THE TORCH STORE )
AND EVERY SINGLE PANEL SINCE THEN HAS MENTIONED A PIZZA INGREDIENT
I would like to improve myself ! I would like to remove my flaws , assuming they somehow exist . In short , I would like to become . . .

However , these people are WRONG . The only way to truly live a meaningful life is to engage in sexual congress with a large number of partners !
Really , you did that ? That's very unkind ! Were they alright ?
. . . Holy cow ! Why indeed ? !
And I'M the coolest !
Will you marry the sender of this , the most romantic of the free web cards ?
Act like me !
Well , it's just that showing off a degree from a reputable instituion can impress prospective employers , while showing off a note from my mom that says " he watched a lot of fun cartoons " could actually get me fired from any job I already have .
Aw , you're always on about epitaphs , T - Rex ! How about something new , like - instead of a sentence people remember you by , an image ? Say , 10 seconds of a silent video !
So I was at the dentist today , and he was all cleaning my teeth , and I was like , " little lower . . . little slower ! "
HECK YES
But can you imagine how fun it would be , to have that sensation of movement indoors , while not actually moving ?
Oh snap ! Utahraptor , you've not only proven me wrong , but you've proven ALL PAST VERSIONS of me wrong too ! YOU HAVE MADE SOME POWERFUL ENEMIES TODAY !
T - REX I JUST ASKED YOU HOW THINGS WERE GOING
" Speak in the voice of a man " : this is a fun trick to use on your neighbours , or to distract telemarketers while you make your escape .
And we do it !
MY HAND GETS SORE
BUT WILL THERE BE ? LET'S VISIT THE FUTURE AND FIND OUT !
I THINK YOU MEAN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
Synesthesia is an amazing neurological condition in which one sensory pathway involuntarily stimulates another . The result is sensory overlap : tones with distinct tastes , letters of the alphabet with their own shades of colour !
Are we TRULY the fubsiest ? ?
You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel - Air !
I love Bill Cosby .
Come on ! It only works if you make all sorts of assumptions , like , oh I don't know , that the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is deterministic and logical !
Or , you know , mammals .
Listen , if we both pretend we can both get what we want out of this conversation , okay ?
He thought he was alone in there !
Hah hah , OK . You are my son , David , and we are trying to locate the Genesis device , which has been stolen , and which has the awesome power to reshape worlds !
And it's a tricky issue ! Giving money to beggars can be helpful , but some feel it encourages bad behavior and undermines the work of social support organizations . Plus there is always the rumour of beggars who take home hundreds of dollars a day ! On the other hand , there may well be people for whom begging is the only means of support they have .
It's so the babies don't go TOTALLY BLIND .
Oh ! No bigs . If it grosses you out to have it inside you , just induce vomiting and you'll puke it up .
HEY DROMICEIOMIMUS YOU'D BETTER NOT HAVE ANY SEXY FUN TIMES BECAUSE I'M GOD AND I DON'T LIKE THAT
So here's how you get started on LinkedIn !
CLASSINESS OF MEDIA BY FIRST MESSAGE SENT
today's comic : UNDERSTANDING COMICS by scott mccloud
Can I let you in on a secret ?
An astronaut .
In your opinion , you mean , and you're probably totally wrong !
Whoa , not everyone needs to fall in love !
Because if so , then I guess I get to work on my life management skills !
I find that really helps me when I'm being photographed .
Yes ! New punctuation marks !
SO UH
Come on , give us at least a hint !
Seriously though . It ruins my suspension of disbelief !
T - Rex , we can - we can easily produce more 90s hits . We just need to bite that 90s style and we're set !
LISTEN , FRIENDS : nobody look them up to check them and we will get along JUST FINE
Yep ! Well - I know Signed English , which is just English translated into hand signs . It's different from ASL , which is a true natural signed language with its own grammar !
People died at a younger age .
They're still working on cutting that page in half , God bless 'em .
This is a fun game for friends to play .
I'm pretty sure the answer is " YES ! "
I'm afraid you'll ask me some personal questions ( of a sexual nature ) that I don't want to answer ! Wait , what the hell ? This was supposed to be a truth serum , not a VOLUNTEER INFORMATION serum !
And YES , I know that was a metaphor I should ; ve saved for " How To Write Stories With Boats In Them " !
Silence , citizen !
YOU can't keep a good man down : we all know it because everyone's seen you try and fail . You totally suck at judging books by their covers , which the rest of us find trivial . Finally , you're unable to fix stupid OR fight city hall .
I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS
You say it like it's not fantastic !
Anyway I totally listened to some yesterday !
Aw , poor guys !
Woah , hold up ! WHICH spring break , T - Rex ? You don't go to school !
You already are !
Holy crap , ENGLISH ! Why you gotta be DOUBLE SEXIST ? ?
The open their mouths , too wide , mangas spewing out onto the ground in a heap .
2093 . . .
HILARIOUS OUTTAKES COMICS II
Everyone knows it but they leave it to ME to say it out loud !
Maybe I'll be wearing a Superman outfit , and in my pocket will be a note that says " I actually WAS Superman , comics were documentaries about me , make sure to tell everyone okay ? ? "
Folks have already imagined those things ! !
The guy who invented the Nobel Prize also invented dynamite ! Oppenheimer worked on the atomic bomb AND on his relationships ! How am I supposed to figure out if I'm net good or bad ?
It's time to spice things up , dudes and ladies ! Today I am only going to make BAD DECISIONS .
COMPRESSED COMICS COMICS
If only 25 % of the population learnt button sewing AND everyone had four friends , then we'd expect one friend to do the button sewing when needed , and the remaining three could use that free time to learn something else !
Ladies and gentlemen , I give you : easydudes . com !
Of course ! Also , " paci " is in wimpy script letters and " fist " is in these big exploding block letters !
THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON : TIME IS MONEY
SUICIDE IN COMICS
Like what ? " Tasty - times " ? " It's time for some tasty - times breakfast " ?
I'm going to write the best story ever . It's called - okay , I don't know what it's called . But i have a fantastic premise !
I gave away the best tip in the title !
It's a world where everyone knows how they're going to die !
I really wish I still knew someone named Beth .
Aw toots ! !
In my life I've been a leader , doer of machines , AND cool but crude party dude . And now , I add another role to that list :
Yes sir !
LATER , T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR GO DOWN IN HISTORY FOR BEING THE WORLD'S SUCKIEST GREEKS :
Dromiceiomimus , I'm really glad we're friends . I like how we hang out and I like that we've shared so much together . So - thanks !
THANKS BURGER KING I GET IT
But she was the only woman you invited , wasn't shee ?
What if the system drops you at the eight hour mark ?
I need to recover my honour . I need the linguistic equivalent of a white glove to slap across someone's face , challenging them to a grammatical pop quiz to the death !
For example , the Portuguese have the word " saudade " which means basically " deep nostalgic longing for something that's left and is loved and which , though we may repress that knowledge , may never return . " You can even get the saudades for someone in the present while anticipating the future , or for something that doesn't even exist !
Hey , you ever think being alive is kinda gross and weird ?
God ! We will DEFINITELY have to agree to differ on that one ! !
Can I get a non - Sherlock Holmes story ?
I know ! And I won't shop there again .
BOOOORING
. . . I have sent a FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST .
You CAN force your heirs to punch a bear in your will !
What if you're out of jokes , T - Rex ?
So much .
Thanks , mom !
The story of how delicious this chowder IS is what won the award .
For starters , have you noticed sometimes while you're in the middle of reading a sentence , the panel suddenly changes ?
" Monkey Whore ! "
The POINT IS , it seems like prayer is either a pretty serious problem with divinity or a complete waste of time . How do you respond to these charges ? !
Not NECESSARILY : Look up profiles , find someone interesting and date 'em , and then say that you " just want to be friends " ! Kapow : INSTANT FRIENDSHIP THAT'LL LAST A LIFETIME .
They're POLYAMOROUS hotties , baby . Out poly spies make the monogamous leaders fall for 'em , then dump 'em before major events to they're all upset and sad and can't focus . Oh wow , THANK YOU , polyamorous hotties ! YOU AND YOUR SLAMMIN' BODIES AND BANGIN' PERSONALITIES HAVE SAVED THE FREE WORLD .
Hmm , I don't know , maybe . . . THE INTERNET ? ?
I think that sounds real nice .
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE STARTING A NEW RELIGION
AHHHH
Plus it wouldn't even get used that often !
It's true ! He also bakes way too many cookies whenever he's baking treats and then when he's done he freezes the extras for later .
But can't you hear the accursed beating of his heart : a low , dull , quick sound , such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton ? Is it not driving YOU INSANE ?
Hindi : problems !
THE FIRST THING PEOPLE USUALLY NOTICE ABOUT ME : my eyes . i like to keep the venom as a surprise ; ) ] ]
Hey T - Rex , I wanted you to know : I won a little bit of money in the lottery and I want to share it with you !
. . . I guess if every aspect of our lives has to be ruled by either entropy or giant corpses stridng across the cosmos like GODS , entropy isn't SO bad .
Also " Kitty " and " Newt " .
Man , what do you have against horses ?
NOPE
Because you're so glad bank exist !
Humans put their own self - interest above the interest of the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM , even if that means EVERYBODY DIES . They call it " the tragedy of the commons " .
Anyone who doubts this need only remember that Batman is really smart , and that they're probably wrong .
Well , I intend to find out !
By being true to yourself , you are forever derivative !
Well , if you ask ME , I'd say it's the experience of " immigrating " , if you will , to a new country . Coupled , of course , with the emigrant experience of leaving your old country behind !
But I guess what I like about Chuckles and his fetish is that it's so impossible , so doomed . He's got this sexual ideal that he'll never reach ! He's like the guy who gets turned on by entropy decreasing in a closed system .
BEEP BEEP I AM A ROBOT .
Dromiceiomimus , I had no idea that " Horses " was available as a last name . Me . Horses ? I could be Mr . Horses ? Why was I not told I could be Mr . Horses ?
I can't take it any more , Dromiceiomimus ! Everyone is off posting their dumb theories based off incorrect facts , and nobody even recognizes subtlety ! So many people are so lame !
And that ! In between radness ! My point is : I'm not old .
Sounds like you'll be making a lot of " green " !
It's embarrassing . I'm embarrassed .
Let's like that too !
GOSSIP .
Qwantz Realty
And we still listen to it super often today , Dromiceiomimus !
I can't think of any right now !
You can see it .
4 ) THANKS IN ADVANCE
I'll be honest , I haven't read any Green Lantern comics . He's got that power ring , right ? And he can make giant green fists with it ? And robot suits ? Can he make robot suits sometimes ?
How do they come up with all my ideas before I even articulate them ?
It's so representative !
It's insane ! I've only been doing this for a hour , but when I'm talking to someone and their phone goes off , and it's like - did they say something wrong ? Did they just reveal something to me they shouldn't have ? Then they put their phone away and make some innocuous excuse " Oh , my friends are going to be late " or something , which only FURTHERS my suspicions !
No you're not !
Was the rap directed at you , T - Rex ? Were you being " rap serenaded " ?
It was hard to get reception where he was ! He was really annoyed because he liked to check Twitter first thing in the morning and now he couldn't . He went back to his regular home and checked Twitter there .
You know how in scifi stories they'll discover sinister time - travelling aliens have been manipulating Earth's events for centuries ?
The news is , you make some convincing arguments !
No , that leaves us with changing the question so we can live in any time period , real OR imagined . I choose the time when everyone's awesome knights !
Suddenly , a futuristic , heavily - armoured flying car shoots past the farmhouse !
MAN THAT'S CRAZY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME TODAY TOO
Luckily , we have arrived to that conclusion via a fallacy so I will be making no such trip !
And nobody knows why it happened !
I - I hope you have a horsey birthday
If you're ever trapped in the past you can recreate Celsius , no problem !
But what a nice realization to finally have though , right ? Perhaps where were DOZENS of women flirting with me in the past , yet unnoticed !
Today is special because we're all healthy and happy !
Are you implying that you found the baby pterodactyl you lost -
Yeah , or like , " single bicurious lesbians " .
Pfft . It's not that hard , yo ! When their team wins , coaches ALWAYS attribute it to a good hustle . When they lose , coaches say there were definitely some good hustles out there , but you can't win em all . DONE .
Anyway , the solution's real easy . When you introduce a character just say something like " Mary hadn't worked her ass off for twenty years to be Chili's ASSISTANT manager . She was shrewd , she was calculating , and right now , she was angry . Also , she had a flashlight on her at all times . "
Do I detect a note of melancholy in your voice ?
And GREAT .
Okay , but if this is the case , why do you imagine a world for yourself in which people's ice cream cones can fall in the dirt ?
It doesn't exist though
Well ! I'M going to create the first POLITICS - FREE film !
But I already do !
something called " cardistry " that involves shuffling , but fancy - like ,
Something AMAZING .
Those old - timey swimsuits that had like , hats and boots and stuff ?
YOU GUYS ARE ALL MAKING A BALUE JUDGEMENT ABOUT BODY TYPES
Not so fast , dude !
AND HE HAS NO CONCEPT OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TOO , THAT'S WEAK
Let's talk about our regrets !
Okay , so what if I said " I think I'll let an assumed future history which agress with my current position be the judge of THAT ! " ?
A small pet , perhaps something bite - sized . . .
A category one ! We hardly ever get actual hurricanes here !
Anyway , I was just thinking that how weird it is that our bodies are basically PROCESSED FOOD , but when processed food comes OUT of our bodies ( tears , hair ) we throw it away !
Coke : Brownish . Affordable . Drinkproduct .
And maybe we could extend the same argument to . . . US ?
DURING THE NIGHT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD BUT T - REX IS REPLACED BY A SINISTER ROBOT CLONE :
I don't live near trees !
Well , light can be thought of as a particle , right ? And so it's like - if rain was falling really slowly , and you were running throught it , you'd hit more particles than you would if you were standing still . I think that's how it would work .
I don't know . . .
FUN EXPERIMENTS TO DO AT HOME
And this freaks you out ?
Isn't this a great farmer's market , T - Rex ? Aren't you glad we stopped ?
I am , good sir !
I used to make fun of Green Lantern for being vulnerable to the colour yellow ! Then I choked on my orange juice one morning and nearly suffocated .
Social Skills Comics
Um , because that's a metaphor that doesn't stop me from being food poisoned to death ? ?
But the issue is that batteries are hard to design : you want to store large amounts of energy for cheap , but you also don't want them to , you know , explode . It's tricky !
Like - maybe if someone has a question about Mario , they could ask me . Only the problem is , lots of other people also know about Mario too so there's nothing special about my knowledge !
BORING !
LISTEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY " GOLD "
This doesn't sound like a very interesting game !
I have received a stern letter from the " government " ! They are angry because I didn't pay my " taxes " last year ! Well , guess what , government ?
Also totes untrue !
So , I've laid out all the clues around town and I've got the party and barbeque all set up !
Linguistic universals are a small handful of properties that can be universally applied to every natural language on the planet !
You do know the two genres are closely related , right ?
HAH HAH AWESOME
Yes : panel 4 . No : panel 6 .
What ? I never got to go on my adventure ?
Knowing who I marry , knowing where I end up living - all of these would be great timesavers !
Or a Koopa Para - troopa . Whatever .
For more tech tips , go to Google and type in " tech tips " ! There's literally millions of them .
But also . . . PRETTY FLAWED ? ?
Dromiceiomimus , I need your help with a prank . The prank is , we all get some really fake stick - on moustaches even though we're all of age , THEN we put them on and go into a convenience store and we all buy ADULT PORNOGRAPHIC MAGAZINES ! ! Hee hee !
NERRRRRRDS
Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally can't talk walking around and behaving like people ! It happens whenever a toaster flips you off .
" He must not have known geography that well ! "
God ! FINE .
LISTEN , MOVIES TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME TO BRING TO MARKET OKAY
A good book title describes the content of the book in a significant and memorable way .
I understand he was pretty upset about this .
Now , I know that can't be accurate !
I think you should cook . It's healthier !
i can juggle pianos
And it works for books too : " Pride AND Prejudice ? ? "
This seems like a position one would take only if one wanted to hear one's own voice , T - Rex !
Combooter cryence sounds like it's for crybabies . I like it , but it sounds like it's for crybabies .
It would be awesome if popsicles tasted like the stick they're on instead , and then the stick tasted like the flavoured ice
Hah ! I can't believe I didn't see it at the time . I can't believe I didn't see it until now !
Batman has BATMAN SKILLS .
Today we're talking about Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen !
Whoah that's way better
Every single world map i own puts North America at the upper left of the map ! cartographers are all " boo hoo , if Australia isn't at the lower right then i'm ALL CONFUSED . " On one hand , i hate to be a dick to cartographers !
Oh nooooo
I imagine that is very true !
So , um . . . who do I talk to about becoming a spy ?
GOD HUNGRY IT SAYS
I have a telegram for you , sir ! It says " HEY T - REX , STOP I AM HERE TO PARTY STOP DO YOU WANT TO PARTY STOP "
T - Rex , have you ever been angry and confused ?
Dromiceiomimus , you won't believe who I just met !
Wow . T - Rex , your system only works if we can objectively measure informedness , which isn't going to happen . Plus , replace " goodness " with " ethnicity " in your phrase and you're a super crazy racist !
Alright , I'll say it : speeding music up makes songs sound ridiculous .
Affect you how ?
The transformation occurred while he was reheating lunch , and he tripped and fell and his head passed through the microwave .
Yeah , what if you ended up being sad ? It would be so tragic , especially if you had been pretty happy up to now ! You'd feel - and you'd KNOW - that one day it's all going to go horribly wrong .
ADVENTURE COMICS !
Yeah , but how far away are the things I want ? 10 years ? 50 ? ? How long can I expect to live ?
Ha ha , what a hilarious misunderstanding .
It's time to CONFORM TO WHAT STRANGERS THINK A MAN SHOULD BE !
Hah ! " Thon " . THON ENJOY THIS .
Yesterday you told me you wanted your epitaph to be " T - Rex Always Needed Sex To Have A Good Time . "
I am giving a " thumbs up " !
'T - REX , YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE ! '
Sheesh , okay ! It was just an amusing little ditty . I wrote it myself , you know !
HOW TO USE EBAY
Shortly after you're born THINGS start pushing their way out of your face . You can't stop or control them . Your parents can cut them free in horror but more will keep coming because they've ROOTED inside you , deep within your skin .
Individuals with stomach and small intestinal disorders may not absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores .
You're right that is inappropriate .

YOU KNOW
DUE TO A HARDWARE CONFLICT , THIS SOFTWARE UPGRADE CAN ONLY BE INSTALLED DURING THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND DAYS AFTER YOUR FIRST BOOT . THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE .
My point is : if for some reason a nation took an ownership claim of yours seriously , they'd have a valid way to pressure your government to make you fall in line ! You could go to jail .
ALRIGHT TIME TO START MY DAY ] ]
I know ! Doesn't that sound nice ?
Man I coulda told you that ! I accidentally almost ate a whole pig at breakfast , you know ?
Zero replies on my awesome personal ad ! Maybe it was TOO awesome ? Maybe . . . maybe there was a spelling mistake ?
Less plagiarism this time !
The slogan will be , " Yes . You can skateboard in your apartment in winter . "
Man ! My enemies SUCK .
But being unemployed isn't sucky all the time , just some of the time ! I don't know ! I'm pooched , man ! I'm pooched !
They were all " I GUESS things get smaller when they're further away ? I GUESS ? "
Sure , but AFTER she's satisfied , she throws out the leftovers and then LATER , I eat them from the garbage . OH SNAP : A FREE LUNCH , and the only effect on the universe is a sanitation worker has slightly less work to do . I literally make their lives easier , AND I make the food system as a whole more efficient .
Neither ! Both ?
Man , what a jerky guy ! I met the jerkiest guy working at the computer store .
Have you ever been asked by a parent " what is going on in your life " only to realize you totally don't want to talk to them about your life ? Lucky for you I can tell you
You know who hasn't written a screenplpay for a while ?
COMICS FOR UNPOPULAR DEMOCRAPHICS
AHHH huhhh AHHHHH huhhhh
Now we just gotta spike it with some vaguely appealing single - word sentences . " Explorer . Romantic . Inventor . Eccentric . " And you're done ! You've got a Twitter bio to be " proud " of .
Any kind is acceptable !
x start saying " frig again , frig , it rules
Yeah , but you were complaining about ex - girlfriends in front of a woman whom you've dated in the past ! That's not exactly a recipe for social harmony .
Also : no asians ?
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE IS AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN :
And he uses it to find his true love ?
The next day the wolf put on sheep's clothing and used it to eat everyone else's sheep too ! This vindicated the boy , but it was too late : he'd already died of plague .
Are they awesome ? Maybe we could be friends !
UTAHRAPTOR IS COMING TOO :
So far I've got four people on the team . The first is Justin Time , who has time - based powers ! The second is Justin Case , who can control probability . The third is Chix Diggit , who is an attractive dude if I do say so myself , and the last member is Tim Foresnax , who can eat a lot if he wants to ! They fight crime and prejudice and have romantic ( mis ) adventures .
T - REX WHEN HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU NOT TO HAVE SEXY FUN TIMES I AM ALL FOR THEM
Is there any conceivable better form of music than out - of - genre cover songs ? The answer is no ! The FULL answer is " No , there is nothing better ! I love them all SO MUCH ! I can never take this back . "
Yep ! We've actually talked about it before , remember ? But - you know , thanks for the reminder !
What about fascist truth , where something is true because those with power say it's true ?
No , actually - I wouldn't know .
I , too , remain fully satisfied .
T - REX IF YOU WERE TO DIE SOON
It's okay ! It was full of cans !
One time a dude went to sleep alone in a scary zone , like , a cave , or a spooky abandoned cabin .
It comes from this playwright Chekhov , who said that if you have a gun on the stage in the first act of a play , it had better be fired by the third ! It's been used to sustain interest since forever : James Bond often gets a bunch of gadgets at the beginning of his movie which he'll use later on , and even Perseus got gadgets from the GODS to kill Medusa with ! It's the same idea , only Bond's better because he has more explosions . Looks like you lose , Perseus ! !
Then MAYBE you should try my great idea of assigning an emotion to every day of the calendar ! !
Is this the punch line ?
So you want a game where you can do - anything ?
Silence ! !
WHAT IF ALL MEDIA BEGAN LIKE RAP BEGAN
Hello ? Purposes just got intense ! !
BUT THEN . . . !
. . . Starring Robocop ?
And you'd know mine !
Just gesture with them while you speak , dude !
Five dollars ! You're ON .
HOUR 26 :
Okay so in 1958 these two US Air Force planes were doing training exercises with a real nuclear bomb for some reason , and they crashed into each other ! And one of the planes was so damaged that it had to jettison its bomb above a bay in Georgia !
Please , there's also no rule that explicitly says a horse can't play chess , but that doesn't mean -
You - you actually know about hats ! You should be doing the talking here . I ran out of ideas after four hats ! !
But the stations are EMOTIONS , like " nostalgia " , " regret " , and " that sad sad feeling that i'm not dealing / with well " ! In music form !
And the game was , by walking around and trying to act normal , I had to figure out what was going on . It was the sort of game where you'd notice trees that had been cut down , touch your arm and mutter , " When did I start wearing a watch ? " , and then talk to your mom and try to fake your way through a conversation about school without knowing years of history . It was fun !
I was just talking about the secret to being loved .
Because you're not giving any real information , just general trends !
You know what can kill me ?
Hello ! You are reading this message because you have been a patron of our " Physical Body Made of Meat " product in the past several million years .
No ! Because they will eat YOU and cut you up with their pointy toenails !
Personality - Wise ? Maybe It's Your Body .
Hey , let's try though !
But it's all an act !
CORRECT !
Hoisted by my own petard !
YEP ! !
I've discovered how to turn most any song into a love song !
Great , actually !
GUY WHO BITES HIS OWN TOENAILS :
A woman trips , falls , hits her head . You run up to offer help , but instead of blood , thick black manga seeps out of the wound . The woman turns her head unnaturally towards you and smiles . There's too many teeth in her mouth . Too many mangas .
Oh snap ! CAN'T NOT DO IT NOW , cats and kittens !
That's how these things always start ! !
Man ! I don't want to go through life as a Nazi pin guy !
WHAT COULD BE SEXIER THAN THAT
I'm - I'm not sure another multinational could love me anymore
Oh Mr . Tusks , there you are ! What are you doing here on the beach ?
the holiday for people with Not Enough Problems
Uh NO , I didn't say I want my LIMBS to fall off .
Like how Alexander Graham Bell and that other dude both independently invented the telephone !
Okay , what flaws did you remove then ?
Once upon a time , there was a young woman called Little Red Riding Hood ! Her parents , who were grown adults , named her after the clothes they bought for her .
So what happens ? Where's the conflict ?
And let me stop you right there , because THAT SOUNDS SO GREAT . I'm SO TIRED of my friggin' unpopular opinions !
But I think a big part of this is that we're only familiar with his greatest works ! If he'd lived TODAY , he might still have written Hamlet , but he also would have written tons of awful stuff : terrible blog posts , terrible comments on other people's blog posts , and so on . I think with all that crap , his reputation would be far less pristine .
ELECTION COMICS
Oh well . . . I was shy . I didn't say anything to her , and then one time I gave her some fries at lunch . That's - that was pretty much the sum of our relationship .
Maybe you should , I don't know , figure out what you want to say about society before you decide on the stunt ?
I'm serious ! People SAY this a lot , but they're always adding a " oh hey if that doesn't work out remote controlled cars are just as awesome " , which , WHILE TRUE , also supplies an out ! By only asking for peace , I'm forcing my entire network of friends to try to get it for me ! It turns negative consumerism into Positive World Change , PLUS , if anyone pulls it off I get to raise my hand in the new utopia and say " Awesome ! This was my idea . "
Miracles ! They happen in real life !
Hah hah hah I take it back ! An intoxicating freedom overtakes you as you tumble to the bottom , the stairs carrying you to where your first journey began , to where you yearn to return once more .
T - REX SOLVES YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
And I'm not allowed to answer these questions with " sex " either !
Ahem . " Great God ! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority . All the daydreams must go ; it will be a wearisome return . "
Having conversations can be hard ! Sometimes you will not know waht to say and then you'll look dumb . If someone says " What do you think ? " and you say " Uh - um , see , - uhh . . . " then you will look dumb .
We are in danger of flunking most heinously tomorrow , Bill !
Yeah , how do they even talk to each other ?
Eventually they'll start dying of old age , but you know what ? As long as you're not the VERY LAST ONE in your group of friends to die , you'll always have at least one rad friend . Hmm life long friendship or talking to strangers at a party on the regular ?
You're right in the middle of Middle English , my friend !
It was SO
HEY UTAHRAPTOR ! I'M DRESSED UP AS MYSELF FROM THREE YEARS AGO ! I'M NAKED THOUGH
Oh yeah !
It's so great , Dromiceiomimus ! It's a real boxing kangaroo with big red boxing gloves , like in the zeitgeist , AND in cartoons ! And he boxes a person so hard that they get their hat knocked off and then when they go to pick up their hat , he boxes them in the butt ! !
But the greater good could be served by granting further ?
One of them will be a dude with the remains of a time machine , and I'm gonna put him down at the Permian - Triassic boundary ( the greatest extinction event EVER , in which 95 % of all marine species and 70 % of all land life became extinct ) ! I'm gonna make it look like this guy's time machine was responsible . It'll be all there in his notebook . " My time machine accidentally blew up and is responsible for the mass extinctions . Frig . "
The best way to revenge yourself on an animal is to eat it .
" Or at the very least , I wish I wouldn't poop my pants when I saw something that reminded me of pooping my pants . " This is us with feelings ! We see something super sad and then BAM : sad for the rest of the day . Or maybe you just REMEMBER something sad and BAM : your good mood is gone ! Sometimes you poop your pants ( i . e . : feel sad ) and don't even know why ! ! Is that really any way to live ?
Wow , I thought you'd never finish fighting those ninjas !
TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL .
AND MY PANTS , OH FRIG , HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN GOING OUT WITHOUT FRIGGIN' PANTS
Throw who off which trail ?
Utahraptor , you can make it too ?
And THAT'S how movies are made !
That the murders are exceptions ? Edge cases ?
AS the story progresses , the narrator increasingly gives up on mystery ever being solved , and instead of describing the actions of the detective , indulges his interest in interior decoration and describes the curtains on the wall .
Parents !
Apollo 11 visits the moon , and some Earth dudes get out and they look around and take back some rocks with them for Earth !
I'M DOING IT NOW SO HARD ! !
Wait , you were seriously planning that ? !
I HAVE !
I who have studied grammar with the hedonistic monks of Mount Syntax , I who have communed deeply with the mark both Question and Exclamation , I who traveled to - AND RETURNED FROM - the deepest caves of Punctuation Prime : you dare to challenge my command of language ? I invented the future perfect continuous passive , bitches !
I don't have any .
IT . MAKES . ME . WANT . TO . NOT . VACUUM . FOR . YOU
I think what I love best about them is when they're used to represent mindless behaviour in our own society . For example , if instead of me , we saw a ZOMBIE DINOSAUR stomping on this house , then wow ! Suddenly stomping on things is highlighted as maybe something we should think about more ! Are we really acting that thoughtless when we stomp on things ? Thanks for the eye opener , dinosaur zombies !
T - REX I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S MOVED INTO TOWN
WE SURE ARE . Don't forget you dirty - ass shoes !
She was like , there , that's climate changed solved . Trees trap carbon and expel delicious oxygen . DONE . Then she brushed off her hands and was like , anything else ? I got a few minutes before lunch .
Well , that's another house gone . I seem to be going through houses like other people go through -
And though the men were brave , the risks were grave In these misty days of yore ; None could ever be safe , in this ancient place , From the threat of Dinosaur .
Yeah ! Plus , we'd have omniscient second - person narration !
Today is a good day I think for riddles ! And hey , look at me !
what the heck , dromiceiomimus
Wait . Wait & # 8212 ; I have the solution ! All we have to do is make a legally binding promise to be best friends forever , purely out of fear of being alone !
God ! !
If you have a problem , yo , I'll solve it ! I'm just gonna wish ; that usually resolves it .
Really ? No interest for a tattoo of a robot with cool pecs ? Or a tattoo of a burger surrounded by a banner that reads " I KINDA LIKE EATING THESE " ? Or a chest tattoo that says " IF YOU CAN READ THIS THEN WOW , I GUESS I TOOK MY SHIRT OFF " ?
What a lovely day for a walk ! I enjoy crisp fall air AND the changing colour of the leaves .
EXACTLY ! Mine too
. . . and say hello to the new , sexy and exciting - SURGE !
Hey , where is she ?
But . . . why ?
Who cares about feelings ? !

I have felt the harsh sting of my own racial joke turned against me ! Luckily , I've been saving a joke for just such an occasion .
THINGS THAT SOUND WAY MORE INTERESTING THAN THEY REALLY ARE
TAG AS SHE IS PLAYED
You can take a baby , put it down in a room full of complete strangers making crazy noises , and that baby will do the following : presuppose those noises have meaning , INDEPENDENTLY INVENT THE VERY IDEA OF LANGUAGE , and then learn to communicate in that language . They will stone - cold deduce rules of grammar FROM OBSERVATION ALONE , and they'll do it way faster than an adult ever could .
Ice cream !
No , we're good !
WHICH IS THE BEST ENTERPRISE
SEXT : we r at the dog park . i ask u to sit and then give u a treat . YES ur a dog , ur every dream has come true . Im so happy for u . Im crying
" What if your next boyfriend is uglier ? "
ALL the secrets !
And then people wanted more fun paintings to look at , so they'd paint a 360 degree ring - shaped canvas and you have to stand in the middle of it , and then you could look all around at the painting of a beach and say " Alack me ! ! it's like I'm at the beach , only it's made of paint and nothing moves ! "
We understand , T - Rex .
THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE GOES TO CLASS BUT T - REX :
See ? I'M ALREADY HELPING .
today's song
You're sexy and other people like you !
But think about it ! Isn't it WEIRD ?
So what's the deal with SISTERHOOD ?
UTAHRAPTOR I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY CRAPPY GIFT BUT I'M STILL REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BATMAN TRAIN
Dromiceiomimus , I think you should examing your house carefully tomorrow morning !
" Ah , then there's nothing to worry about . " Angola said while consuming stuff associated with being really cool like mixed drinks that are hard to make and food that's very expensive and doesn't taste as good as a Big Mac anyway , " as a meteor is defined only as the visible streak of light caused by a meteorOID travelling in atmosphere . Some light hitting our planet won't hurt anyone , yo . "
part 2
Utahraptor ! I heard you're in trouble again !
I though free verse still had to , you know , have poetic elements in it .
Sometimes you need to look in the mirror and say " That , my friend , is someone with some friggin' FLAWS . "
A spy , yeah !
That's right ! I said it ! !
Several days later he was going through his phone pictures -
And then what ?
. . . I looked it up on yours .
Can't hardly say that I do !
That's silly ! Bangladesh isn't even on the shores of the Pacific .
It is PRETTY CRAZY , Antonio Xavier Kavalier III !
Anyway , it doesn't necessarily claim that drywall spends its time writing poems about , you know , DRYWALL STUFF - it only claims that there are some elements of sentience in everything . When you boil water it might be enjoying it , that's all . Or , it might be writhing in pain , screaming for mercy with a mouth that now speaks only with a scalding voice of steam .
Only because you're assuming he's omniscient . The dude has to sleep ! Sueprman could laser him from orbit while he's having nappy times .
But I alone dare to ask : what's next ?
But he's by the books ! I don't think there's anything in the " books " about deputizing criminals to go after other criminals . Why wouldn't he just interrogate him to get the information he needs ?
Frig , man . That's not bad .
AND YOU WOULD BE CORRECT
The smelly dog who pooed / Has spied me in the nude / I say to him " Hark ! Who goes ? "
Dromiceiomimus ! Are you in ?
And that's sad , T - Rex ?
That's right , britches ! !
Whatever became of this woman ?
But if he confesses love to her , I'm now UNhappy with my friend , and we're down 5 HP ! Forget THAT noise .
Gelato still has fat in it .
THEN , you give the child to the polyamorous crowd , who have new members replace old ones quickly and quite often . Um , infinitely often .
T - Rex , our friendship is based on respect and love , but there's also a spark of attraction there and even if we both don't want to explore it - now ? Ever ? Does it matter ? - it's nice , and it's fun , and I don't want to change it , and if I were a man things would be tangibly different .
But sometimes these objects are found with human remains !
DAAAAAAANG
I said that blackmail is unique among the Major Crimes because it's two legal acts that add up to be illegal ! But it's not QUITE unique . I'm speaking , of course , of prostitution !
Pretty okay !
Oh god .
Okay , promise me right now that you'll never perform anything on me that could possibly be referred to as " The Happy Swamping " .
And he says " Hey baby , you remind me of my coffee table ! " And she says , " Why ? Because I'm so small and cute ? " and he says , " No , because I'm going to stub my toe on you later ton -
What what what ? ? There's a checkbox for if you're looking for casual sex ! ! Oh man ! Should I check it ? Message me if you think I should check it ! !
Except that means what I ate for breakfast was a god , and my house is built out of dead tree gods .
Dunno , I guess I'd better buy these chips and find out !
I am filled with my " Ordinarily Cautious Doubt "

There can be no greater sadness !
HEY I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU'RE READING OVER MY SHOULDER
I propose that it's more reasonable to find events from HISTORY that are objectively interesting , and look for time travellers there !
Hey ! HEY !
IT'S STILL THE WRONG WORD
He's on what appears to be a pristine shore , a perfect scene of wilderness ! !
It was by accident ! He just flew in while I was yawning ! It might still be alive inside me and THAT'S GROSS , THIS WHOLE THIS IS SO GROSS . Bleh !
Ghosts have to be invisible , at least part of the time - that's what makes them ghosts ! But if you accept that , it's fun to try to see how ghostlike you can make them without making any FURTHER assumptions .
We were all like . . .
IT'S SORT OF LIKE BLOOD PUDDING BUT ON TOP OF THE BLOOD WE ADDED -
Keep on not suffering catastrophic failures !
Plus you give up any powers of reasoning .
SO YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY CLIMBED MOUNT EVEREST THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD HUH
The power failure goes worldwide ?
Fine then - I'm ending it ! I just thought it would be cool to have people working on reanimating our bodies when we die , but if it's such a big deal for you , forget it .
Maybe we shouldn't feel bad about letting down our earlier iterations who wanted a pet lion " so we could hug " and who kept eating everyone's boogers " on accident " ? ?
YEPPERS
And then in my story Clarke's looking for a girlfriend !
OR IS IT RATHER AN AESTHETIC DOOMED BY THE PREJUDICES OTHERS APPLY TO ITS ORIGINS
It turns out he's not kidnapped at all , he just left without leaving a note and got his OVER ONE THOUSAND EVIL EXES to fight you . And YES that means he's a guy who's had sex with mushrooms and turtles and - like bullets ?
" I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE "
And more information is being tracked and recorded everyday !
I decide to die !
LET'S NEVER READ MANGAS AGAIN
AS DO I BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL AND I THINK THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS LIVING HONESTLY IS TO ASSESS MY FEARS AND WHY I LET THEM AFFECT ME
So now more respect for poetry ?
Still ! Things would be different !
BAAAALLLLSSSSSS
Getting out of bed can be dangerous , teens ! !
1980s : contaminated emotions are discovered in America . Scientists quickly respond , and seek funding to examine the precise nature of endearment .

Something to tell everyone that right here , but in another time , we - all of us - were great .
I guess I'd hoped that by shifting the technology to escalators , the awesomeness might somehow - you know . . .
He's a rhetorical device though , so he can't make it / exist at all , BUT , I can lay down some sweet negotiation tips for YOU , Dromiceiomimus .
YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT I LIKE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS a web " card "
WHAT I AM NOT A GHOST T - REX
I could tell you some dog facts that would BLOW YOUR MIND , but when it comes to cat facts , I don't really - know . . . any ?
SOMETIMES after you say it , you shrug .
Ho - ho - hold up ?
No , no !
My parents !
First message sent by transatlantic radio !
If Bigfoot is real , we can expect to find Bigfoot droppings in the woods .
In the Garden of Eden story , Adam and Eve eat an apple from the tree of knowledge and then they're kicked out of paradise and THE AMAZING ADVENTURE OF NOT LIVING IN A GARDEN BEGINS .
FICTION . As a man who is attuned with the world around him , I make up stories that SEEM real , but are actually just lies that I imagined ! It's called " writing " ; look it up ?
Even for people who aren't comics fans , it's a great way to explore the medium in a low pressure , fun environment !
Well , MAYBE . But a statue is still awesome .
Ooh ! Or the sound of fists pounding on your door , and then the unmistakable sound of splintering wood !
Oh , great . Now the MIDDLE AGES is preemptively plagiarizing me too ? Terrific .
COMEDY RELENTLESSLY ENSUES ? ?
Oh , an you can ?
I thought I would die laughing !
Rex : Attention , parents ! Be careful when you have kids , because when they grow up , whatever media properties are popular NOW are going to be brought back when they're nostalgic adults with disposable income !
LATER , A LONG TRAIN RIDE HOME :
You know " more than one partner " . . . " more than one book " . . .
" Here lies T - Rex ! He died as he lived . . . "
I was promised ocean facts !
But we already have new punctuation , and only corporations use it !
They're not cute : they're freaky ! They know too much ! They open up jars and stuff !
Nanites are tiny robots ! They're SO TINY that they can robotically mess with things at the molecular level .
Dude , you know what I say ? I say , " forget class ! " .
That's not a bad idea !
With this in mind , I'm going for a walk !
Too easy , Utahraptor !
T - Rex : What the heck , my giant brain has been down for like THREE HOURS ! !

Dromiceiomimus , do you have any sex - related questions that you'd like me to answer in my column , " Oh My God , How Could You Not Figure This Out On Your Own ? "
YOU SEEM UNAWARE THAT " FAG " IS SHORT FOR " YOU ARE A * F * RIEND I RESPECT ; * A * S SUCH I * G * REATLY LOOK FORWARD TO COMMUNICATING WITH YOU IN AN HONEST WAY IN THE FUTURE "
Okay . Do you want to go get a pizza , T - Rex ?
What's that ? I'm sorry , I wasn't paying attention !

So Icarus had a great time flying and when he finally landed his dad said " Wow , I sure was wrong " , and they spent the rest of their lives flying just as close to the sun as their clever mechanical wings would take them . Kids ! The moral is never listen to your elders ! !
I'm totally looking forward to my time travel adventures , Dromiceiomimus !
As you may have noticed , sometimes your teenage children will use downright unfamiliar acronyms when you watch them talking to their friends on sites like " Facebook " . But there's no mystery to them ! For example , " WTF " means " Where's the food ? " Your kids will say " WTF " at all sorts of times , because you know teens : always hungry ! !
Daydreaming again , I see !
They use boxes !
SOUND IS THE LOW - HANGING FRUIT . If silent films didn't exist and someone invented them in a science fiction story , I would write the author an email with subject line " RE : Silent motion pictures " and message body " PUH - LEASE . " But somehow they actually did exist in real life , so in conclusion , our timeline is totally ridiculous and embarrassing .
A metaphorical sense . What metaphor would that be , exactly ?
UNFORTUNATELY .
As people with bodies AND assumed souls , we find the idea of divorcing one from the other terrifying ; therefore , the only way we can explore the consequences of these is through the lens of horror . Tada !
As usual !
S - U - C -
How come you don't wear it ?
Dromiceiomimus and I went to escape the heat !
Oh !
Hello . Would you like to hear a joke about dinosaurs ?
Turns out it's really expensive to get the rights to remake movies ! But GOOD NEWS :

In fascism , one person is in control of an entire country , and he tells everyone else what to do ! He is the guy who is micromanaging his zergs or whatever .

The world wakes up to find continental drift has sped up a hundred thousand times ! Instead of moving centimeters a year , continents will now be kilometers away from where they were a year ago ! Maps are redrawn almost constantly !

Human beings are complicated , but they're also not really that complicated . It's super easy to pass for one .

LESS SAD AT FUNERALS ? ? I mean , okay , yes , but you know what else happens ? THE WORLD CHANGES FOREVER . Projects that would take lifetimes to complete now become easily achievable ! YOU CAN TRAVEL THE WORLD FOR FREE JUST BY DYING , WHICH IS LIKE , REALLY EASY TO DO . Death because a brief time - out instead of getting kicked from the game !
THE BEST OF ALL THE HOLIDAYS : everyone gets a new tank ! Then we drive around in tanks blowing up other tanks until there's only one tank left ! Then we destroy all evidence Tanksgiving ever happened and submit to having our memories erased , as per the accord we all eagerly agreed to when that deranged billionaire offered the world the chance of Tanksgiving !
Aw poo .
Surely that just kicks the can down the road !
My bike will be called " Susan " .
Sometimes , SOMETIMES , I worry my ideas are too awesome
9 AM :
Quiet at the back , or I'll transfer you to " I Am An Angry Person Who Sits In Garbage All The Time And Smells Like It Too : I'm Bad At Things " !
What fresh hell is this , Dromiceiomimus ? My past self is reminding me of all the compromises I made growing up !
The other problem with your idea is that not knowing something doesn't mean you don't care about it !
So all my talk about the entire universe being a big simulation ignored one pretty big question , which is this :
So if I live one life in a dystopian today , then when I die I can return to an earlier time and prevent that dystopia from taking place !
It's VERY NECESSARY .
Baseball is played , my dear friend , because without it we would not appreciate the times when we don't have to play baseball .
IS THIS A PARTY OF THE LAN OR RPG VARIETY
What about Cassandra , prescient but cursed so that nobody believes her ?
Oh man , now you've done it
But do you think you could take the party DOWN a notch ?
I refuse to say ! !
It's Wednesday ! Come with me on a JOURNEY OF EDUCATION as we learn how movies are made ! !
I may look different , but I assure you . . .
But most of them are probably long decayed !
Huh ! I don't know , Dromiceiomimus !
And I'm not evern sure how he got it published ! One passage reads " rhumba thumba , farts and shoes : I want y'all to be nice to yous . " Because of how dumb it is , I can never forget that sentence .
Because . . . they're aBOOlitionists ?
T - REX HAS YET TO FIND CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR ANYONE . AGAIN . COME ON , T - REX

Today is a good day I think for increasing the integral count of my age !
Oh my god YOU'RE ON , BUDDY ! !
Its a human , T - Rex . Babies crawl on all fours , then they walk around and then when they're old they use a cane . Come on , that riddle's from Ancient Greece . That riddle is so old - school , the techniques necessary for modern school construction won't be invented for two thousand years .
I have thought of the perfect prank to play on the Utahraptor ! I will confide in him personal stories about my youth . . .
Utahraptor , come over for lunch ! I think you'll find my soup is , shall we say . . . SOUPERB ? ?
Women either !
These disses ! They're almost TOO sick ! !
Noooooooooo WHO CARES
For breakfast I dined on the unfertilized eggs of a chicken . You may quote me now .
A person who only ever does what you tell her to !
I'm smiling not NECESSARILY because I'm happy but because I've been convinced my ancestors would want me to ! !
Mysterious commercial voice selling me something : I AM ALL FOR THIS .
Sure do ! I love getting a fresh breeze on my face and smelling the dew on the grass or whatever that night - time smell is . It's great ! In summary and in conclusion : if there's a sleeping with the window open fan club , sign me up to be EL PRESIDENTE .
And you're still stomping !
Ask him about science stuff though , okay ?
Hey ! Yeah ! I'll make my own magazine ! AND it'll be my magazine for TEENS !

You know how vanilla extract smells really good , but tastes really gross when you drink it ?

Luke Skywalker gripped his lightsaber tightly and scowled . " I'll ask you one last time , " he said through clenched teeth . " And if you know what's good for you , you'll answer . Tell me why you're here . . .
But I guess what bothers me is that it seems you determine whether or not a generalization is valid by evaluating its conclusion , which in turn is based on your own prejudices !
ENDING TWO
3 ) Airplane food ?
It is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me !
But I loves eggs scramby !
Yes ! Also : NEVER ASSUME A WOMAN IS A MAMMAL .
You're late for class , T - Rex !

My favourite food is bread ! It's the most delicious thing to eat before , during , and perhaps even after a meal !
Hey , how come my turkey is unconscious ?
I'm not ! Knock yourself . . . around ?
We've all had relationships that have gone south . But good news : as a man who has been in SEVERAL different relationships that only EVENTUALLY ended , I am absolutely qualified to answer and all relationship questions ! !
Dromiceiomimus , I expected nothing less than the fun of a job well done !
That's all I'll say about THAT .
that Utahraptor and his ilk . I don't care what he thinks we did !
So it's a platformer ?
It's not always that special though , you guys !
And Also That ( TM )
Exactly ! And beneath that , another shirt that says " IF I WAS STANDING NEXT TO A VISIBLE MINORITY WITH THE OTHER SHIRT I DIDN'T MEAN IT AND I APOLOGIZE ! ! " Beneath that , " YOU GUYS , I'M NOT ACTUALLY RACIST " ; Beneath that , " IT WAS JUST THE UNFORTUNATE JUXTAPOSITION OF MY SHIRT FROM 4 SHIRTS AGO AND A PERSON "
When was this ?
MOM
More casual , eh ? More like more casual KISSING , probably !
# / usr / local / bin / qwantz
Hey , who are you talking to ?
It's a surprise !
I also saw a statue !
Neat ! So you're wandering around being all agog at electricity and airplanes and stuff !
UM
As I'm attempting to convey , Dromiceiomimus , it was awfully gross ! Why can't food get more delicious as it gets older ? Why does everything have to turn to a brown mush whenever I forget about it ?
I don't understand !
It involves alphabetic Latinate graphemes AND glyphs from the European instantiation of the Hindu - Arabic numerational system .
Wasn't this one on a boat ?
Perhaps a powerful metaphor for LOVE ?
He also thought the Earth was the literal center of the Universe ! Fun !

So they put her on trial for seducing women . Then she revealed she WAS a woman , which got her in more trouble ! But then the women she'd treated showed up , praised her , and sasses their husbands for hassling her , and unlike EVERY OTHER HISTORY STORY , this one ends with Agnodice being acquitted and the law being changed .
" Norway Atlantic " isn't that plausible a name .
What makes you think humans want to eat monkey food ?
You'd have to be dead though .
And in mine ?
You can also barbecue whole chickens , T - Rex !
THAT'S . . . ! !
It is extremely erotic
That fever has long since PASSED
- aaaahhhhhiiiiiiIIIII don't know ! Probably scream a little ?
Aw , T - Rex ! Now I'll have that song stuck in my head ALL DAY .
Oh , it's true ! But it'd be SO AWKWARD to walk up to someone and say " hey I'm not really dumb , just FYI " , wouldn't it ? I'm in over my head here !
Okay , cool
Dromiceiomimus , you'll bid on naked pictures of me , right ? For profits ?
Like wrapping them in the plastic bags they came in !
Apparently not ?
Moi , je suis un loup - garou !
Oh God , we're being attacked by zombies !
I guess you'd know about that , huh ? Cause of the whole " religion " thing ?
Indeedy ! Now everything I say will be the truth !
SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION .
Hey , I have some surprising news ! Supertasters are a real thing !
T - REX HAS WRITTEN A STORY ABOUT A DOG THAT GETS SUPER POWERS !
Alright ! Time for me to meet a nice woman named Samantha , as per my prediction of yesterday ! I will romance her until she no longer desires further romancin' . The romancin' will be mutual .
Dromiceiomimus , come quick ! I accidentally swallowed a fork ! !
Isn't that right , Dromiceiomimus ? Wouldn't you agree that I have an uncanny understanding of the female gender ?
FACTS ABOUT GIRAFFES
Huh ! I wonder what he's up to these days ?
My point is -
THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE IT ONLY TAKES LIKE THIRTY SECONDS TO SET IT GOTTA GO
Don't do it ! !
Is this a new kind of come - on for you , T - Rex ?
ELSEWHERE . . .
Maybe you liked the characters . Maybe you thought the plot was neato ! Maybe your favourite part was some of the words that the author chose to say things with . Mention that in your review !
Your grandmother knows what a pedophile is ! What do a webcartoonist , Microsoft Windows , Adobe Reader , and Flash have in common ?

BETTER CAREERS FOR FICTIONAL SUPERHEROES
It's objectively true . So just apply it to other jobs , dude !
Ah , but you're assuming everyone's sexing up a totally genetic stranger . If you sex up a relative , any child produced will have fewer grandparents !
Aw man ! There's probably pee on it !
Tonight I am going to bed early .
I never meant to kill my best friend !
And how did that taste ?
ANYWAY THAT IS ALL CHANGING TODAY .
MOM did that ?
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING SEVERAL MMORPGS OF LATE
But it's clear you're just trying to cheer us up by acting like this isn't totally rad . How many times have you done it ?
I , uh -
THE END :
Want to never talk about our relationship like this again ?
THAT , my friend , is an excellent slogan .
And if I stay too long at the top of the stairs , I'll die !
The only idea I have right now is to invent kitchen appliances that somehow crave the flesh of the living . That'd be a bad decision , right ?

ONE IMAGE SEARCH LATER :
So ! Has anyone here ever tried setting goals , and then achieving those goals ?
Like in cartoons ? Held up by your belt and shirt collar ?
Plus , if people saw me on the street they could say " Hey , it's all Well and Good ! " , except that they wouldn't actually say the " all " , so it would just be " Hey , it's Well and Good " , which doesn't really work .
PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES :
One day , Timmy the human fell in love with Sally , who was also human . Two humans decided they liked each other . OOH , WHAT A SURPRISE .
Yes ! God on . . . !
Alright !
I am certain of it !
Really ? Cowboy hat robot was 10 % destroyed ?
I warn you , Utahraptor : what happens next may BLOW YOUR MIND .
EARLIER
Oh , is that what's happening I gotta , um , go home .
You're telling me .
well - what form of reincarnation are you talking about here ? A lot of people believe that if you're bad in this life , you might come back as a lower animal the next time , like a sucky dog or a poo bug .

Old friends are the best kind of friends because you still get along really well , even though you maybe haven't seen each other for a long time . It is a time for healthy nostalgia and for talking of tomorrow !
I'm beginning to doubt your impartiality , Facebook Shakespeare !
AWESOME .
Oh my gosh it's so freeing to finally say this out loud .
. . . . Is what I'd say if it weren't for Friday two weeks ago
That way , everyone is talking and thinking about you . You become famous simpy from holding a contested opinion ! And the best part is yuo don't actually HAVE to hold the opinion , you just have to say you do . It's so easy ! Dromiceiomimus , what are your thoughts on gay marriage and prohibition ?
THREE WEEKS EARLIER . . .
That somebody else wrote .
" Hippity hoppity hippity hop : this story is about one SASSY - ASS mop " ?
That's - that's true . It is best to be sensible about wack adventures . Maybe I'll get back to you in a week ?
Details increase the chance your partner - GOD WILLING - will find something interesting about you . This lengthens the conversation . Once you've talked for five minutes , say " Great chatting with you , [ PERSON'S NAME IF YOU STILL REMEMBER IT , YOU WON'T ] , but I've got to go . "
The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience , an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment .
It is the " Reverse Godwin " and the most powerful debate technique ever ?
Oh man , I knew a guy like that !
But I guess no matter where he is , this is the end of our daily conversations . . . I don't know what I'm going to do with the second half of my day if he's not around .
Man , you can't really believe in a " language organ " that makes communication innate .
Hello there ! If you're like most people aged 0 to death , you probably have FEELINGS . If you're angry you might say " Hi , I feel angry " or if you're horny you might be heard to remark , " Yo , I'm all horned up " .
THE ANSWER IS ME
One job I'd love to have AND that I just realized you can get by simply declaring yourself open for business is sex advice columnist . And guess what ?
It's like , there's this guy I've seen around and he's funny and great and we like the same stuff and I just know we could be great friends . But how do I engage this guy ? Do I just walk up to this nearly complete stranger and say " Hey , you don't know me but I've been thinking about you a lot and I really think we should , you know . . . BE TOGETHER ? "
" BITINGLY hilarious ! " - - Everyone ? ?
It means that that one incident is indicative of a larger trend in my life .
Why don't you tell me what you really think ?
And then he gets shot by a random criminal !
ONOMATOPOEIA
He , um - did pretty okay , actually !
The game is ended when a dreamer achieves even a fleeting touch of the dream . That touch will have to suffice .
Aha ! You just used the wrong " its " there , my friend !
I know it doesn't work in all cases , or maybe even MOST cases , but it works with vaccination , right ? A weaker version of the disease teaches your body to fight the real deal . So what I'm wondering is if I ate something disgusting , does that , you know . . . level me up for some REALLY insanely disgusting things in the future ?
Maybe it's not like in movies , though ! Maybe it's kinda terrible .
2 ) Joyriding 3 ) Public Mischief 4 ) Hooliganism
I DO BELIEVE YOU GET BRAINED BY A TEAP CUP
Well , good ! Cause that's wrong !
I knowwww
It's one of the most lethal toxins we know , and it's EVERYWHERE . It's SUFFUSED the dirt that's all around us , WAITING . The ONLY THING that's saving us ( SO FAR ) is that it can't grow when exposed to oxygen , unlike US , who usually ONLY grow when exposed to oxygen !
Carpenters shaped and carved wood .
Um , that's right . I was thinking of something else .
I like movies where there's some magic and then the next morning two people wake up inside each other's bodies !
Sure do ! I have a friend who is visiting from INTERNET . He's pretty rad ! But there is a problem . . .
Aw MAN ! Best wish ever ?
It's technically correct !
" . . . Go on ! "
THAT JUST MAKES IT MORE DEPRESSING ! I don't want to be commodified , Dromiceiomimus . When people said " You can't put a price on life " , they didn't mean it was an impossibility - they meant it in the permissive sense ! They were trying to give me GOOD ADVICE .
Dromiceiomimus , you've got to help me ! I've doused myself in a chemical I discovered that makes me seem irresistible to women ! Only I've become TOO irresistible ! It's out of control !
Other scenarios they describe as " nice " include all five Beach Boys waking up together , spending the day together , and then holding each other close . They also wish their kisses were neverending , as that would be nice , and they wish they were all married , they'd be happy . " Wouldn't [ that ] be nice ? " , they ask each other in the chorus , largely rhetorically .
The dreams can take many forms , but generally assume the limited form of a screaming child . The dreams run from the dreamer , desiring at the same moment to be caught and to be free . These desires do battle in the dream - mind , while the dreamer , unable to comprehend the essential futility that surrounds him , gives chase . He runs wildly after the dreams , a ridiculous parody of who he was before this terrible game began . They are all reduced to clowns .
THANK YOU PRETTY SURE ONE WILL SUFFICE

PHRASES THAT NEED TO BE USED MORE
I was carefully reading the BIBLE . . .
OMG , that's a brilliant idea !
Many philosophers think it's impossible for us to truly understand what it's like to be someone else . How it feels in their skin !
" Being sad sucks "
He's also my new critical trademark . When something is really juvenile , I'll say it's by Timmy . It implies so much earnest ineptitude !
ME AND THE OTHER GODS ALL DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU NEVER USED AN ALLEGORY AGAIN
I used to hide in the bushes outside her house !
OH WAIT , SORRY , NO , THAT WAS LA MARSEILLASE . IT'S FRANCE .
Every atomic bomb used in war was dropped in August !
All too true !
Friends : TOO MUCH WORK ? ?
Is this the face of exploitation ?
It's a thought fueled by rage ! !
Future perfect continuous passive ?
Why , I'd be fired !
Man , forget that ! Time controls TOO MUCH of our modern lives . I will be the one to fight this creeping chronology by becoming its first true antithesis . Yes ! I will become . . .
I need to think of awesome presents to get all my friends !
This country is great ! Also , holy crap , they want to murder EVERYONE .
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THIS HAPPENED AND T - REX DIED IN A REALLY TERRIFYING WAY :
And yet , you are !
Setting , themes , and basically anything else can ALSO be used as a narrative hook , but they're all pale imitations of Spider - Man's death being announced on the first friggin' page ! Compare and contrast " As the bullet sped towards his eye , Neil wryly observed that things probably couldn't get any worse ! " with " As the bullet sped towards his eye , Neil suddenly remembered that by the end of the chapter , Spider - Man ! Will ! ! Die ! ! ! The bullet sped closer . "
Voting ! It's important , I guess .
T - Rex , what if instead of a man named " Art " there was a woman named . . . " Science " ?
Granted , it's not THAT long a period but -
Poker sure seems to be popular lately ! Does the road to financial independence TRULY pass through Gambling Towne , USA ?
HEY GUYS
Stephen Hawking says the best proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not overrun by loads of tourists from the future !
I just want to say this to America and her whole family of Americans : thanks for doing what I wanted yesterday . Jane America has a lot of influence , and it's great to know that when it counts , the Americans are on the side of What I Preferred , Thanks .
Today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things , out here in the REAL world ! How are you today , Gertie ?
Nobody knows ! It's a kind of wood ? Probably ?
While not as good as solids , without liquids we'd lose blood , which means , scientifically , our bodies would be filled with some sort of blood - like gas - in which case minor cuts would send us flying around the room like a balloon - or a " blood plasma " , which I think is already a thing .
Love grows were she goes !
. . . will be corrected in the short term !
Now what you hear is not a test : I'm rapping to the beat ! And me , the groove , and my friends are gonna try to move your feet !
I believe it was after this proof that A . F . S . added the " Friggin' " to his name !
Yeah : at the extreme , you have panpsychists who believe that the entire universe possesses a single mind , and that everything , including us , is a part of it .
Utahraptor , we live in the future . I can go out TODAY and buy an mp3 player that also can store a small number of PHOTOGRAPHS . Clearly people will give up on high fantasy soon enough and get back to basics , which is and always has been robots who are unsure if they have feelings . You'll see !
Hey , how's setting yourself up for a vision of tomorrow going ?
Sherlock knew the stories were popular , but he had to laugh at their inaccuracies . Watson was , of course , pure fiction . He knew Art had to make the substitution because nobody would believe that he was helped on his cases by his real best friend AND adopted son , a giant green Tyrannosaur Rex named T - Rex .
The fact that this scam continues to work kinda paints a pretty irrefutably dim picture of our basic nature ! Appeal to greed and you'll always have takers , regardless of right and wrong . Go us ?
And real boring !
My favourite are the extended takes , where you ask your subject a question , they answer it , and then you hold the camera on them for a good ten seconds afterwards while they glance around and look ridiculous .
Tattoos are insurance policies ! They're ways of reserving who you are now for the rest of your life .
And I'm through feeling ashamed about it ! I don't care who knows it : I myself J . O . on the regular ! !
AHHHHH
Burning skies would not be the worst of it , however !
Thank you all for coming : I remind you this meeting is classified . Until yesterday , we believed " Frosty " was hiding somewhere in the north . We were wrong .
Finally , things were looking up for dream T - rex !
And before you say " what WOULDN'T they do ? " to cheer me up , know this :

Some people celebrate " Pi Approximation Day " on July 22nd , which is 22 / 7 .
. . . ummary and in conclusion , that's how " in medias res " works ! THE END .
I wish I was never born !
Good ! So far I've got over FOU - over THREE characters , and I've got a conflict too ! The characters want to go to the ice cream store but one of them is like , " oh hey , I feel like I've had enough ice cream . "
No man , they're all in fun !
One day when you are older , you will look back on all the dreams you have yet to fulfill , while I whistfully look back upon a fulfilling life of stomping .
NOPE . He's really chubby so only his GIANT BODY will do the trick . Also , this is a real problem ethicists write about and they have made his monumental corpulence CRITICAL .
Hello Dromiceiomimus ! You'll notice that I am happy because I spent all day saving the world in video games . It was fun !
Maybe , but I don't think so ! We're different , more mature people now , and if we make sure it's more casual - less high expectations , less intense - I really think it could work !
But we've also got a DEADLINE . And even if we somehow escape this doomed planet Earth , the universe itself will eventually cool so much that life won't be possible . Look , all I'm saying is that if you've been putting something off , maybe today's the day ? We're gonna run out of tomorrows eventually .
Finally , just as my driving instructor did before me , I'm going to end the course with a pitch for my multi - level marketing herbal weight - loss pill pyramid scheme .

Relationships ! Sometimes thay are hard , but NOT if you have a great captain for the ol' SS Relationship !
Not really
PUSHED SOMEONE DOWN A SLIDE BEFORE THEY WERE READY :
Two people decide that they've got some genitals they're not using right now , and that THIS , my friend , is kind of a waste !
What's it all about ?
That wouldn't be so bad
T - Rex , I've been feeling down lately and I was hoping talking about it with a friend would help !
. . . well , that's just not a problem easily solved , Utahraptor . That's still a problem that we CAN work on solving , but I don't think I can easily solve it for you here today .
What do YOU know about computational linguistics ?
Because if you have a prenup that says , " Wow , NOBODY'S getting rich off this marriage " , then it's clear that nobody's getting married for the money . The only reason left is love !

EPISTEMOLOGY COMICS
So far !
Hamlet II dreamed he was the lead singer of C + C Music Factory . He woke up . " C + C Music Factory ? " he thought shaking his head . " How irrelevant . " He then focused himself on the seriously erotic business of being Hamlet II .
Good times , good times !

You're sure he didn't tell you , I don't know , that you're special ? To be excellent to others ?
CORRECT
Oh ! It's - romantic ? I , um - I like how he says he will love the eponymous earth angel forever and ALSO ever more .
It'd be nice if people were more flirty with me . It'd make me feel more attractive .
Morning Drominica !
Listen , if there's a group of people on stage and they start out throwing out " wouldn't it be nice if WE were older " s , I don't imagine a hypothetical female third party ! I look at THEM .

Brightly coloured fall leaves , being gently covered in snow !

Yeah , but what if the majority decide to be totally racist against you ? You're pooched !
A woman smiles , a little bit ? Let's obsess about that .
Sometimes , in his most private moments - the tears are real .
a little thing called GOOD MANNERS ? ?
It rules ! All these kids handed in essays with massive spelling mistakes !
Actually I'm not going to spoil the ending !
That was like a 7 . 17 hundred billion weeks ago !
I'm going to get tattoos commemorating life experiences I WISH I'd had . Perhaps a nice banner on my chest that says , " Around the World Race Participant : Giraffe Division ! " Or there could be a picture of me , riding a giraffe , and then the giraffe is straddling the world .
And let me just say : thanks , T - Rex !
Do you know who really did invent the fire extinguisher though , T - Rex ?
Pooty pooty ?
* GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP *
Sometimes , my friend , you have problems that I really don't know how to help you with .
Let's assume the universe is deterministic ! !
I can see the appeal in having a good solid sending !
LIES
SINCE LIGHT TRAVELS FASTER THAN SOUND , IS THAT WHY SOME PEOPLE APPEAR BRIGHT UNTIL YOU HEAR THEM SPEAK ?
I mean , I agree with you , but I can still accept dreams as a narrative device .
Hah hah hah ! Come at me , Dro ! !
Something called A LITTLE WHITE LIE SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL ? ?
I ATE SOME FOOD
Dromiceiomimus : she's got opinions !
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD : punctuation that says " I'm saying this literally but I'd love for you to read into it " . So I could say " Hey , we should hang out more " or " The eagle cries at midnight " and folks would pause and say " YES . YES WE SHOULD / IT DOES . "
IRONY :
T - Rex , is what I hear true ? Are you going around making out with yourself ? !
Anyway , I meant what I said about going nuts . I feel like I've got this powerful instinct for self - destruction , and I'm just fooling myself if I think I can control it .
Right . But it's kinda a mute point ?
And a second course of extra dark chocolate with caramel , with more challenging courses of mint chocolate with raspberry filling and organic chocolate with peanut - butter filling and mint slipstreamed in .
But maybe we don't have the money to buy an ambulance anyway !
I know , I know ! I was just a little irritable and making jokes . I don't actually blame the baby , Dromiceiomimus !
( True story ! )
. . . uh , yes ?
Of course ! It was a great way to extend the length of my essay , AND it made my points more emphatic . " Trees are tall and pretty " became " Trees are very tall and very very pretty . Verily ! "
A sense of FUTURE sight ! Dudes !
Anachronism is when you have technology being used before it was invented ! It happens whenever Shakespeare listens to his MP3s .
Dromiceiomimus , in this universe , instead of being my ex - girlfriend , you are a street - wisened homicide detective named " Lenny " !

T - Rex , you need to be quiet now !
God , you're omniscient , right ? You know everything !
It's where we keep all most of our salty liquids !
Because then if you know about 18th century literature you can punch them aside and say " OBVIOUSLY ! "

Oh ho , I'm sorry , is it BITCHY in here ?
Qui dit que vous ? tes responsable du moment o ? les choses deviennent " vieux chapeau " ?
MAN , even if they do , I can STILL see my sculpted copper 'cepts changing more than a few folks over to " statue - sexual " ! Sculpture - philiacs ? Bustarians ? T - Rex : Anyway . T - Rex : I'M SURE they'll think of a word .
Hah hah hah ! I finally have a way to deal with history being SO FULL of jerks ! The nice people from history who died will probably make me sad though .
" Oh hey , it's that guy I know : UTAHraptor ! ! "
T - Rex , I was hoping I'd run into you ! Would you be my Valentine ?
But what's that ? You want MORE acceleration ? MORE of these delectable forces of G ? ?
I HAVE .
* smooch smooch smooch *
That is a problem I have never experienced but which I must believe exists . I CHOOSE to live in a world where this could one day be my problem !
What ? Whoah , I meant to say " A high five " , of course !
Meanwhile , I can't even think " I wanna eat meat tomorrow with Utahraptor " without literally thinking those words in my head like it's friggin' amateur hour .
It would also work on animals , but all the ones for cows would say " made into delicious cheeseburger " .

At the end , I'll have an exhaustive list of Things That Don't Exist . Then in the future if anybody ever wants to see if something exists , they could just consult my list !
There's simple ones like " I promise to clean your room " ( your future is now altered ) , but there's bigger ones like " I now pronounce you husband and wife " : you weren't married before , and now , oh my God you guys , you're totally married ! And then there's " I hereby christen this ship 'HMS Sinkytowne' " and " I sentence you to death by misadventure " .

Nobody can argue them . Utahraptor , I've invented nothing less than arguments for religion that can never be disputed by atheists !

Today I am hungry ! Perhaps I could satisfy this hunger by eating . . .
Hey , can you do " I wish I was never born " ?
What'd SHAKESPEARE do that he gets to be canonized as History's Greatest Author As Long As You Speak English ? I wrote some plays too !
But if you've already ordered your meal , why would they ? They still get their money either way .
Okay OBVIOUSLY that's a thing that would happen . And I would select the dinosaur countries , but NO COUNTRY HAS A DINOSAUR AS THEIR NATIONAL ANIMAL .

Either way : obviously I want to see you flex them nostrils .

THAT STORY'S BEEN DONE
OPTION 1 : IT WAS A MONSTER , YOU DIE !
I'm a dinosaur ! We're not supposed to stand up straight !
My friend , I believe you are unfortunately TOTES WRONG on this one !
What if the sun runs out of fuel ?
Aaaaaahhhh !
ARGH ! I had hoped to avoid this realization , but it's inescapable : I hate the mall ! I know it's a cliched thing to hate but it's TRUE . I hate the crowds and the cell phones and I hate the music and the consumerism and the shops that don't have anything that I want . And I didn't hate but I really disliked the burger I purchased in the food court . It had no toppings . Also it was very dry .
Also , maybe the guy tripping was HITLER .
That's ridiculous ! They didn't phase out of existence for the sake of a pun . You're just using this as an excuse to cram an etymology lesson where it doesn't belong !
People are predicting the future all the time . All the time , you guys !
That's KINDA the question they came here to get answered , dude ! And I'll tell you what : a lifetime of disease is looking PRETTY GOOD against staying in this hospital waiting room for another five hours !
Holy smokes , you're right ! Divorced friends hooking up with each other's exes is going to be INTENSE !
Oh man , am I ever sick . Me ! I never get sick but this time I've gotten sick .
What if what we perceive as " being high " is actually our natural state , and it's the REAL WORLD that's actually chemically altered ? ?
Okay ! Let's call sex " wacky times for two or more , but actually usually one " , " kinda weird hugs " " kinda weird hugs with benefits " , or " annoying the bed " .
COMPRESSED FILM COMICS : " THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT "

Dude , it's their JOB to argue all day about whether throwing fat incompetent babies off bridges to save five people is ethical !
Well they're about to start , once they hear my sweet chuckles !
Oh no ! Is Utahraptor in trouble again ? IS he in ALL the trouble ? To reiterate slightly :
T - REX FIXES THE RELATIONSHIPS
ANYWAY the moral of the story , DROMICEIOMIMUS , is it turns out everyone who gets caught has to pay the same fine !
Aw no , no , you don't -
I propose a rigorously defined language without syntactic or lexical ambiguity !
I wonder what it's like , being an attractive woman . Would I be tired of guys coming up and talking to me just because I'm pretty ? Or would I rather find it flattering ?
WORKING OUT TO IMPRESS THE LADIES .
SIMPLE WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE
Some TEENS go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction ! You can see it in the background of some of the shots , but they never notice . . . because they are all too busy learning about friendship !
Utahraptor , this one's perfect though !
AW GROSS
Need a stressful problem ? Check it !
Right now if you're hungry you grab a box of cereal , open the box , shove your arm in the box , grab a fist of cereal , and then cram the cereal into your mouth . I've got some bad news , and it's god's honest truth : COOKING WILL NEVER BEAT THAT . Cooking is for when you say " I plan to be hungry an hour from now , soI will spend my time from now until then preparing for this eventuality . "
But I'm not sure we should give up on professional suffixes so quickly . Sure , maybe indicating gender is pass ? , but we can still indicate other things !
Outta my way , kid ! I'm a thief fleeing from a crime I just committed !
Any REASONABLE person would recognize " Frankenstein " could easily be shorthand for " the Frankenstein creature " , just as " Toyota " stands for the Toyota Motor Corporation .
TODAY IS THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE HAS TO TELL A STORY FROM THEIR PAST BEGINNING WITH " I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET TOPLESS "
That's inspiring ! I'm inspired !
Damn damn damn . I can't call now and reschedule because I'll have to admit that I forgot entirely .
It sounds cruel to me !
Can you taste it on your tongue ? " Tweens " .
T - REX , WE'RE GOING TO SNEAK INTO BED WITH YOU TONIGHT !

I just can't get enough of this free new lifestyle that greatly complicates your children's office sex ! "
OKAY FOCUS ON ISAAC INSTEAD
Okay so what characters are in it ? There's you , obviously , and that bro who built the big boat .

So Paul Grice went on to clarify his cooperative principle , identifying four maxims describing how people generally communicate . He called these " GRICEAN Maxims " .
Well then - phrase it differently !

Hah hah ! Why'd he do that ?
Today is a good day I think to talk about robots !
You know what ? It's really weird when you say that .
ALTERNATE WHOLE THING ACTUALLY
Why is that bothering you ? You've never cared what I think , you inconsistent bastard !
Hah hah ! What a ridiculous allegation !
Maybe the worry folks have is that people will respond like you !
I know ! Should you laugh . . . OR RUN IN TERROR ?
But there's nothing in ID ( as I've formulated it ) to say that the two can't exist peacefully . One just doesn't belong in science class , because it's not a science . It belongs in religion class .
What the heck kinda shabby bodies are we inhabiting here ? !
That's just racisms

Hello ! I have played rugby exactly once ?
Someone dropped an arrow out of a plane and it nailed my friend in the eye and it was extremely sawesome ?
FUBS ! Oh my goodness . I have to get a dog so I can name him Fubs .
And THEN , I woke up !
Apparently the smokin' hot among us care not for physical dimensions ? ?
I thought you knew I was joking ! I thought you knew " Emily " 's not her name .
I would like to be one of those guys , please !
Who knows what I'll find out about myself next ? Maybe I'm the kind of guy who keeps hair in a box ! !
And just how is this a logical fallacy , T - Rex ? It sounds more like basic probability !
That way we get to read about babes with brains , AND their problems would all get solved way easier . Oh no , aliens are attacking the planet ! Luckily , our brightest and hottest have already invented a way to save everyone . Hooray ! Hot Earth is saved ! !
. . . I do believe that last sentence let me down as well
. . . Better ?
WYLD STALLYNS !
so anyway , the secret I discovered to being loved is simply -
Why would I screw myself over by not putting a new bag of milk back ? That's crazy !
GUESS I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT AT ALL NOW

If you catch the ball , then they don't get a point , nothing changes , and we've all been wasting our time . If you DON'T catch the ball , then they get to run in a big circle and get some points based on how much of a circle they ran in . A full circle is worth a whopping one point ! Also , no fractional points are awarded . Have fun , you guys !
Alright , world ! I'm putting myself out there ! Who wants to engage in sexual relations with me ? ? I am DTF .
With the babies , yes .

It occurs to me that I've never written a love poem ! I'm a romantic guy - how hard can it be ? I can probably conjure up unfathomable depths of soul - felt emotion like THAT . For instance , here is " I just got kissed . . . on the lips ! "
WE WENT A LITTLE CRAZY
[ [ Speechless ] ]
You know , besides being stood up all the time , it wasn't actually that bad a year !
I think it's a subtle but pervasive effect ! If a language doesn't have a word for something , I think I'm less likely to think about whatever it is that word would refer to . For instance , in English we have words for " friends " , but what if we had a single word for the phrase " friends who deserve pie more often " ? I bet I'd consider buying people more pies !
Spring's not even here yet and you're complaining about winter ?
Wow , people really enjoyed my book of Sex Scenes for People with Problems ! Everybody likes me and I am richer now . And they'll like me even more when they read my new book . . .
THIS COMIC BROUGHT TO YOU BY TOURISM EUROPE
I KNOW ! I feel like , thanks to " I have problems " , I have unintentionally spoken the language of the sea many a time .
Professor Science , we can SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE that people are wrong for getting mad at me for saying life is worth like twenty bucks ? It grows in crusty milk , it is like the most free thing ever ! ! . . . PROFESSOR ARE YOU EVEN HOME
Wait . is " technically " a pun there ?
Because it's probably not even POSSIBLE to capture an entire person in a book , and even if it were , there's just too much information ? I'm not convinced our brains have enough space to store ourselves PLUS all of another person at the same time !
That's why I'm vowing to get out and get exercise every day from now on !

ALTERNATIVELY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE THE GENESIS I HAVE PREPARED AN EXCELLENT ESSAY - RESPONSE
I REALLY THOUGHT HE'D BE THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPER SECRET PRANK
Today is a good day I think for taking control of my life ! No longer will I allow myself to be pushed around ( by random chance or otherwise ) !
Boo ! You suck , T - Rex !
Whatever , man ! I bet I won't be the only one taking a picture !
PLUS T REX THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD TIME .
Okay , how was your day ?
Oh , hey , Dromiceiomimus !
He's the most compelling character of our generation : we all know it
Well , come on , you'd need more of a description than that !
But man , imagine living in a world with literary robots ? It would be the coolest !
So what about relationships that can't be summarized into one word ?

What would your father say ?
That's one mystery I'd like to get to the bottom of !
Isn't it interesting how " maroon " can mean both " left alone " and refer to a dark purpley colour ?
What else can you do on Tumblr ?
Dromiceiomimus , does Utahraptor owe YOU any money ? Because he owes me 30 bucks and I was thinking , if he owes you money too , maybe we could team up and get him to pay .
Evil twins ?
And we multiply that by the fortunate chance of having a parent who is a literal rocket scientist .
My beats are so sick they have blood coming out of their holes ! EVERY ONE of their MANY HOLES .
No man , I was gonna argue that we need to knuckle down and read more nonfiction , and also , dream more nonfiction .
Do you think I would be good at fisticuffs , Dromiceiomimus ?
I've decided that I will put my tremendous height , strength , abilities , intellect , and colour to good use !
And sometimes you die .

Ah -
T - Rex , you've got to stop the madness that seems to grip this Universe ! There is another way to live : a way based on peace and mutual respect !
Oh man , did I get you ? Did I get you ?
Last night I dreamed I came home and there was a spy there ! He was trying to steal my DOCUMENTS !
I've doubled my money !
To the last , I will grapple with thee ! From hell's heart , I stab at thee !
NOT TO HER ? ?
It sure is !
That's not the end of the world , T - Rex !
Without backgrounds , your characters are lost in a featureless white void from which there can truly be no escape .
Then I'm going home and math is a waste of time forever . SORRY ; IT'S TOTALLY TRUE
I am personally insolvent !
But they sold it anyway , often as a universal panacea !
Midas used his crown to cover them , but his barber obviously found out and had to tell SOMEONE . So he dug a hole and whispered " King Midas has ass's ears ! " into it , as one does . Then grass sprang up , whispering the same phrase to passers - by !
When I was a kid it was okay , because I didn't have any cultural context and didn't understand that maybe companies WANTED me to spread the word about their ads . But now that I'm a grown - up target market dude , I know that companies sometimes design ads with the express intent that I'll get excited and tell my friends ! And it turns out I don't really like being manipulated for profit by strangers ?
I like dinosaurs !
" Can the process be generalized to any new diseases ? "
yeah !
Super nice !

Okay , no , but he DID come up with the theoretical framework that allows a phrase such as mine to be reasonably constructed in a meaningful context .
Because it feels useless ! Because most of these people just want to take on of the most transcendental achievements of our time and belittle it any way they can . They're not interested in facts !
I think the phrase is more to try to find sense to a senseless loss , T - Rex .
" I was always impressed with her wit , her beauty , her intelligence and her sense of humour . "
Borders : super weird ?

If there's one thing you know , it's not women !
Attention , people who are breaking up with someone ! Don't say " it just wasn't meant to be " , okay ?
Or loneliness .

Depressive realism is the theory that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world than the non depressed . It started when psychologists experimented with some regular chicks and dudes AND some depressed chicks and dudes .

And the phone guy was like , " hey , on some exchange equipment it's possible to trigger a ring on your own line - which could be mistaken for a call ! "
Wait a minute . . . Penn Guinn ? THE Rita Lerr ?
OKAY ! THAT'S IT FOR HORSE FACTS TODAY
What ? It's FACTUAL ! People need to know !
If I'M being mercenary by wanting a friend with a pool , then sexy young people who have the express goal of seducing a rich older partner who will soon die and leave all the money to them are mercenary too .

Also , eventually I've PROBABLY got to return the helicopter .
It's like hanging out with a computer friend , only he has emotions ! Well , I guess it's MORE like hanging out with a regular friend , only when he says " Pass me a bowl of fruit " it comes out as a monotonic " Pass me a boal of frui - it " . What's not to like ?
The Devil ! I told him off pretty harshly and I guess I hurt his feelings ? Does that make me a bad person ?

And neither of us looks away , and for some reason I think , " What's this guy's deal ? Is he . . . A JERK ? " and clearly the other guy's thinking the same thing , because he tenses some . And I see that tension and I tense up , thinking " Maybe he's going to punch me . I should get ready for that " . And he probably thinks the same thing , and I see his reactions and start to think maybe I should throw a punch first ! AND THEN , we pass each other and nothing happens .

At the cold end of the scale we find " hot as the Dickens " , because Charles Dickens was a real guy who is dead now , so he is a skeleton man . Skeletons are the temperature of the ground , which is cold and boring . Let's say . . . 10 degrees celsius .
So they agree that it's time to sex , and then they go away and we all wonder what's going on ! But not for too long because one comes out and says " We're gonna 'do it' " and we all go " Ohhhhh " and then they come back again and say " That means we're gonna have sexual intercourse " and the last person goes " OHHHHH . " He's the slow one .

How come they want to have kids so quickly ? Don't they want to live a hedonistic adult - child lifestyle , like mine , for just a little longer ?
A name sets up EXPECTATIONS . " T - Rex " says , " This awesome dude will probably be a great friend ! " But Lord Britishface III says " Here is a man who will wear a monocle in his old age ; surprise him , it may pop out comedically .

I would make SO MANY jokes about her name !
He's dead now . These maxims are pretty useful though ! There's the Maxim of Quality ( don't lie ) , the maxim of quantity ( only say enough to make your point , no more or less ) , the Maxim of Relation ( be relevant ) and the Maxim of Manner ( be clear , brief , and unambiguous ) . These are four different different ways we cooperate with each other when communicating !
With an infinite natural lifespan , the chance you die of ANYTHING raises to 1 . Literally the entire universe will kill you , if you give it enough time .
I have a great idea ! A way to add DRAMA to our everyday lives .
Maybe it's done by magic !
Teen Astro sounds kinda dumb , actually .
I won't !
You were a bit boring , so I went somewhere else !
I CAN'T GO BACK
T - Rex , I'm having dinner with a coworker and I'm not sure if it's a date or not !
then I have no control over the decisions I make !
There is if you imagine the debt in tiny butterfly dollars , each colourfully illustrated with even tinier butterflies and flowers .
So ? Bruce Wayne's not that important .
You let it loose ? !
" Yes , the only things I enjoy now are the simple pleasure of piloting this starship through the mostly - empty , samey , and uncompli - cated void of space , " Sherlock said .
HONESTLY
Dude , I simply employed lots of ingenuity and cleverness ! SO much .
When I'm dead I want to be rembered not for my fossiled remains but for my . . .
We're just sorting it incorrectly ! !
The thousand - yard - dead - eye stare ?
That's a terrible story , T - Rex !
I sometimes feel fubsier than most , T - Rex !
" What a good date ! "
I rest my case before you can reply !
WHAA ? ?
And by " a sleep " we say we end the heartache -
Probably they found this weird hole with water at the bottom , and now they're wrestling with the ethical issues of exploiting a shared common resource for personal profit .
" Curiosity . . . SATISFIED ! ! "
It's cheap lazy writing by talentless hacks with no creative muscle !
T - Rex ! It's me : yourself from 10 years in the future ! We're just going to call everyone " bastards " when we meet up with them !
CONGRATULATIONS
T - REX DECIDES TO DRINK A BUNCH A FEW NIGHTS LATER . NOW IT'S THE NEXT MORNING .
" Oooh , dude , I'm gonna steal that , " Sherlock said .
What if all of reality is an illusion ?
Pretty nice , dude !
" Oh crap , her name is 'Emily' , I've been calling her 'Dromiceiomimus' " ?
Any non - eating PSAs ?
It's right after INTHISHOUSEALLTHEBEDROODOORSLOCKFROMTHEOUTSIDEDAY ? Come on man . This is baby stuff .
I know ! It's the same with me . MY ONLY CONSOLATION is that somebody else probably thinks I , T - Rex , have a stupid face , so at least I'll get my prejudice from both sides .
FINE . " Suddenly , everyone died . . . INCLUDING ANASTASIA IRONHOOF . "
Unfortunately , it gets worse .
You hear that , Professor ? We don't need you at all anymore !

Robyn's great - uncle Chris died and she inherited his mansion , on one condition : she had to spend a single night in his spooky haunted house ! " OH MAN , SO SWEET ! " Robyn siad , after she was done being sad re : death .
I think it's cool that most people will agree that " murder is wrong " , but that they all might have very different ideas of what that actually means . We never really specify !
On the flip side , whenever housecleaners clean a bathroom , they're PAID to kill the bacteria there ! So those tiny lives are worth negative dollars . And there's SO MANY bacteria , Utahraptor !
I can't believe you were hiding behind the couch the entire time !
I have a hunch you might find some surprises there , is all !
THAT PURPOSE IS TO MAKE ME HAPPIER
And if someone says " can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp " NOT ONLY do I think of Sugar Crisp , I think of the jingle too !
Okay , so let's say your Twitter bio is " I'm fun and I have cool interests ! : ) : D ; I "
T - Rex is there a point to this or are you
I'm glad you like it ! What , uh , what was it I got you again ?
Your attempts to help us are clearly causing more harm than good , T - Rex ! You see that , right ? It's like you're living out some stock sitcom plotline !
I do ! MOST OF THEM .
T - That's attractive , right ?
Another weight - loss scheme ?
Well , I've also incorporated into my auto - didacticism a distrust of schools as inefficient , repressive institutions . It's part of my new " damn the man " persona !

" Also : SCIENCE . "
You overlap each and every religion in a Venn diagram !
You know what would answer the very important question of " who is the manliest ? "
It's not !
It doesn't matter what you choose because you have a super dumb name ! Suddenly , you die of it .
Aww , don't worry Champ ! Not everyone gets it on their first try !
And they fight crime ? ?
Question period is over ! !
Man , these animals are WITHOUT FEAR . I don't see how acting like I'm not afraid will help things !
It is ! It's on account of how I've got so much body mass that it takes a lot to get me TOTALLY WASTED . I've been buzzed , but never drunk ! I've never had a hangover !

A FEW WEEKS LATER , T - REX GETS HONKED AT AGAIN :

I SPECIFICALLY specified that it's for winning arguments / friendships .
Aww , don't feel lonely T - Rex . You know we'll always be there for you !

I CAN 100 % GUARANTEE SCOTT NEVER SAID THAT .
Yes . He's yelling " Status ! " and there's a dramatic strings version of " Red Red Wine " playing . It's a very tense scene !

Oh shoot , it's so easy !

PROBLEM 5 : SKINNY DUDES TALKING ABOUT MODERATION IN DIETING
Shortly :
Oh man , are you using the fact that all the answers are " yes " to diss my awesome question ? ?
Lazered dudes are not as relatable as romantic comedy !
WHAT THE HECK
Dromiceiomimus ! He's ENTIRELY sentient , and you shouldn't be so racist against dwarf elephants in in bowler hats who have been elected to the office of vice mayor .
Well - I mean , you'd do the same thing for us , T - Rex .
Maybe Rach should spend her time trying to generate electricity !
Attention , people who are hunting jobs ! You are know as " job hunters " and guess what ? I have some tips for you , my friends !
Kinda jealous over here !
But aren't all our " choices " bound by our personal limitations anyway ?
That sentence is BASICALLY my daily affirmation
I agree ! We've got to find something else for you before you've become a cruel amalgam of the uncles Scrooge and Pennybags !
Look bro , this fake rhetorical relationship has meant like , nothing to me .
Yeah , I ate a lot !
Y - you have one prepared ?
STAGE 1 : THIS IS GREAT
Well , T - Rex , the whole point is that you say these words with conviction and understanding and honestly accept their meaning . It's not like -
Dang it , I always suspected this was so
I guess if you want something done , you have to describe in detail how to do it yourself ! !
I don't get it . She's the singing frog and you tried to make money off her performances , but she never sang showtunes when you wanted her to ? Is that the story ?
It's a mod for Grand Theft Autos !
How about you go TWO DAYS wihtout stomping on anyone or anything ? This is my challenge to you .
I will !
It's exciting , Dromiceiomimus ! And I guess I do like the IDEA of bad decisions more than I like the , you know , ACTUAL CONSEQUENCES of bad decisions , but this might cure me of that at least !
You tried to play off slowing down the Earth like we'd all get an extra holiday , but we're actually gonna LOSE holidays ! What are we gonna cancel , huh ? ? CHRISTMAS ? BOXING DAY ? VALENTINE'S DAY ? BOXING DAY ( OBSERVED ) ? ?
T - Rex , thanks for the award , but I'm not wearing a gold medal that says " DROMICEIOMIMUS : THE CLASSY DAME WITH THE SIX - SYLLABLE NAME " .
" If you really need to pee , but there's no washroom so you pee into your mouth instead , how much time does that buy you ? ? " Mel asks , before adding a patently transparent " asking for a friend "
I'm serious ! I figure it's harder to make that first friend than it is to make the 20th , and I'm concerned that if I moved to a new town where I didn't know anybody , I wouldn't have any friends .
Pretty darned sweet , my friends !

SPACE HIGH FIVE
See this is precisely the sort of attitude that got you in this class in the first place .
Yes ! And the magical fallout means they can't ever go home again ! ! I always thought I'd never say this , but . . . " I really want to read a novel set during the Fairy Magic Civil War " .
Some people would still want to be free !
So she stops making mistakes ?
Dromiceiomimus , you know how doctors will hit your knee with a hammer to test your reflexes ?
And we're tired because we were up all day ! !
All I have to do is sit around all day and think , then I become enlightened !
LATER THAT SAME DAY :
T - That's cool , man .
UM , THAT'S WHY I'M SELLING IT
Plus , PLUS , alternate universe sliding !
MOTION PASSES !
I've chumpatized myself ! I'm like the guy eating at Burger King his whole life and you know he's actually never realized you can make burgers at home . You don't even have to be dressed for home burgers , me ! And naked burgers are one of life's great pleasures !
You've distilled an important issue down to " something might be happening I dunno , maybe ? ? " Also , you don't even mention human influence on the climate , which is a serious concern !
It is my favourite season because it is so pretty !
NO , DON'T SAY THAT !
A little ! But a lot of alternate universes would probably be at about the same tech level . What I'm really interested in is culture !

It turns out dogs are so awesome that maybe EVERY book should be written from the point of view of a dog ! Like , who here read Ulysses ? Nobody , right ? But who here would read PUPPY ULYSSES ? ?

Nope ! It's a friend who's having a crisis . Angola thought Tunisia was being rude , but didn't realize how good she was being to her friend , so it was complicated and confusing . THE END .

Okay Okay ! Things with my name on them I now own include : a bullet , a salad , a flight of stairs , a blender , my dog because I taped it to him , a DVD , a CD , a cassette , a record , a wax cylinder , a computer , a bear if that guy on the computer is to be believed , an instance of every article of clothing I own , AND baking powder .

Yeah , you won't have to deal with that until you're way older !

The most popular words are mostly particles though ! " To " , " the " , those sorts of things .

It's too late ! Your last words are " T - Rex was right , that was sweeeeeeeeeet " !
Nope ! Even if you're somehow shrinking atoms , physical laws don't change and light speed is still a constant . As we got smaller we'd notice light " speeding up " , as it'd cover more ground in the same amount of time !
Wow , is that T - Rex . He & # 8217 ; s the dude with the confusing allure , and I want to find out more ?
I do ! And or escape . . . !

People use this metaphor all the time , all talkin' about " going places in life , " " getting a head start in life , " " being at a crossroads , " and so on . It's so entrenched that to talk about life using another metaphor seems odd ! For example , saying " I've saved $ 3 . 55 in life " sounds weird , but only because I'm using the much less popular " LIFE IS A DISCOUNT STORE WITH SALES THAT CAN OCCASIONALLY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF " metaphor .
We're out of food !
WHAT WAS THAT
Let's assume the quantum mechanics many - worlds hypothesis is true , and for every decision I make , there's parallel universes where I'm making the decision differently , with every possible outcome being realized !

Um , that would kinda be ignoring the CONSPIRACY ?

We go back and forth sending " I got your 'I got it' " letters forever !
T - Rex , stop ! you cannot invoke pragmatism itself as an argument !
You said it !
My goodness , what a wonderfully evocative metaphor
" That " is an amazing word in the English language ! It may be an amazing word in other languages too , but it is DEFINITELY an amazing word in English .
Man , I'm not good at that junk !
. . . is what Utahraptor cried before he got struck by five lightnings at once ! " PS : T - Rex rules and I'm glad we're friends " were his last words ! THE END .
Ok , so that last joke didn't work so well . But wait till he hears this one ! I'll say " You know what's great ? "
T - REX YOU'VE PLAGIARIZED 100 % THE DIALOGUE IN THIS STORY FROM THE BANGLES AND THEIR # 1 MEGAHIT LOVE BALLAD " ETERNAL FLAME "
Joseph Plead is the fourth in a long family line of police misconduct investigators . But when he's murdered and no cop will touch the case , it's up to his barrister son , Joe , to track down the criminals . . . in or outside the law . Federal courts meet street justice , every Tuesday night on " Plead the Fifth . "
Wow , I'm having a WHA -
It all goes in the vault !
Holy shit , what are the odds ?
Okay , it's cool to do two women at once !
No , I meant the whole " shift the argument to the future " thing , so that nobody can disagree with you ! It was smooth .
Born too soon to have our consciousness survive indefinitely in a robot body , but born just late enough that we can all TOTALLY see the option coming ?
Pretty sure that's how the saying goes !

INCORRECT !
But it's not NECESSARILY Parkinson's . It could also be dementia ! Or any number of progressive neurological illnesses , really .
Sure it does !
They also say , " An apple a day keeps the doctor in his house . Look : the doctor has no clients . "
Hah ! Those are just a special " he said / she said " format for lies !
Time to go and get some HEARTY MAN SLEEP !
But as anyone who has tried to draw knows , there's a lot more to it than that . Then in the 15th century artists figured out perspective and suddenly they could paint things like " buildings " or " hallways " or " cars if they were invented yet " and have them actually look like what they're supposed to ! And of course , this was like when lens flares got added to Photoshop : artists started adding blatant perspective EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME .
Hey , English ! Why you gotta be so sexist ?
Who here wants to make out ? Because I want to make out !
Wait - what's this ?
Mega Man doesn't have a two - player mode .
GEEZ , Utahraptor ! Thanks to your personal confession , this moment just got AWKWARD ! !
Yeah , but it totally worked for a while !
See , that's what I thought !

House shopping is what you do when you think , " Man , rent is pretty expensive ! Furthermore , I'd like to paint a bum on the wall and not get in trouble . "
Pfft . You're just jealous .
Utahraptor , I put to you that vampires and zombies ARE , IN FACT THE SAME BEING . Zombies are merely FAILED VAMPIRES , the deenerate case of that transformation process ! ! The thirst for blood , without an intellect to restrain it and refine it , becomes a mindless hunger for flesh !
GOOD DOG ! !

I don't see that here .

That fails to consider extenuating circumstances , like the fact that maybe I'm Batman ! So I'm stuck . I know it's useful to allow the police to make exceptions , but I don't want my freedom dependent on whether I get a nice cop or a mean one !

This story is moronic .
T - Rex , enough ! Is this story supposed to have a case of the sucks ?
DUDES ! I TOTALLY GAVE THE CHICKS SOME TIPS
You know what everyone does ALL THE TIME , but none of us talk about ? JUDGING OTHERS . But now we can talk about it , through the magic of " euphemisms " !
I don't want to talk about it .
Ghosts , huh ?
Gross !
Um , I'm thinking . . . That a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tensions between the life I ACTUALLY want to live , and the stories I'd love to be able to tell ?
NOBODY KNOWS WHY THIS IS SO . Some say it's because wood burns yellow , so like cavemen we believe " strange sky fire ball " is the same colour . Others think it's because the sun IS briefly yellow at sunset - a time FAMOUS for atmospheric distortion of light and colour - and we just assume it's always like that .
That's so gross , T - Rex ! What'd you do ?
. . . Actually that's awesome ; I'm glad we live in this wicked sweet world ! !
DEAL
I CAN'T THINK OF A REASON AGAINST LIVING THERE EITHER .
You'll stare at each other for a long moment .

So there I was , lying my in bed , ALMOST ASLEEP , and this terrible techno music starts blasting ! It wasn't even good techno . It was terrible . It was so loud that even when I closed my window I could still hear it ! Incidentally , I was lying on my back , so that if the words were rendered visually , they would appear to be sideways .
Okay , so I want one that conveys all the sass of saying " x , bitches ! ! " without the casual cussing and for any value of x . I want punctuation that when read causes all readers - regardless of who or when they are - to whisper a frank and awed " oh snap ! "

If someone wants to contact me they can get in line ! LITERALLY . Outside my house .

Yeah , maybe . I think I still need some more convincing .

THERE NOW YOU HAVE A COLD .
No Way !
Luckily , WE modern people have a little thing called " SCIENCE " and so we know about stuff like washing our hands before sticking 'em in places and how a fire works . Maybe you history people should've invented some science , huh ? Maybe that would've helped you not die ALL THE TIME , huh ? ?
And the world " understandable " is itself understandable , so it's self - describing and therefore autological too !

NO REGRETS ! ! Incidentally , if people keep trying to make telephone calls using your erection , stress that you've got " a boner , not a phone - er " .
So at his own request his sailor friends marooned him on a deserted island and sailed away . And it turns out they did sink ! But Alex didn't know that on account of how he was marooned alone for the next FOUR YEARS . He thought he'd be rescued in days , not years !
" Enjoy your BodyPartz ! "
Teens like to remind each other of what they can achieve if they apply themselves , and a nice place to live is at the top of that list . That's why you'll see them say " LOL " all the time !
OR GO BANKRUPT
Yeah , I'm with Dromiceiomimus on this one ! " Deci " is right there in the word , dude .
Wish you could relive the past , but don't have the technology ? Here is how you create an instant
Utahraptor ! He says spinning Will Smith every week was his favourite part of the show ! He said they wanted to reuse footage but he kept volunteering to do it " fresh " !
" DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES "
. . . that thing it says there !
Sometimes when you're in an accident or about to be hurt , time seems to slow down ! This gives you more of a chance to react to ensure your survival !
. . . Utahraptor did you say something , I MIGHT'VE fugued out there for a second
Oh , I'm sure I'll learn that in time ! For instance , if that thief went on to kill my Uncle Ben , then that moral would certai -
Different kinds of sexuality .
Incorrect !
Its precise meaning will forever remain a mystery !
Lobsters live in shallow water , and would be crushed to paste at oceanic depths . Finally , lobsters have a distributed network of ganglia instead of a centralized brain , which means conceiving of a god , let alone one that can conjure miracles , may well be beyond their abilities .
Maybe it's the whole butterfly dreaming he's a dinosaur thing , T - Rex !
That's pretty good , huh ? For you and your racisms ?
UNCONTROLLED WILDFIRES
AND I'M LIKE
I HOPE THIS HAS NOT AFFECTED OUR RELATIONSHIP
What the hell , I despise that last sentence so much that it's actually hurting my self - esteem ? ?
T - REX's DRIVING CLASS
Delightful .
COMICS FROM THE FUTURE
Computers are useful because they eat electricity instead of animal parts . In olden times computers were made out of people and you had to feed them animal parts , vegetables , and water or else they'd DIE .
Probably plenty !
No ! !
Yes , my friends , I would have to confess :
Solving this mystery will put to rest many of the niggling mysteries of my creation ! I will finally have an " origin story " !
There are easily enough variables involved in girlfriend !
I'd actually prefer to be the only " passenger " !
Yaaaaay !
Check it : once upon a time there was a beautiful little prince !
YEAH YOU
This is called " comics " .
While the T - Rex " solution " involves only MINIMIZING taste , MY weightloss innovation involves both a nose hairclip AND a piece of something gross - smelling that you stuff up your nose . It makes ALL food seem gross - nasty ! Don't settle for half measures : smell the difference !
What about the backsplash ? What about moisture issues ? What about material costs ?
Absolutely !
What IS a computer ?
Dude , you're making the Makeout Express ticket validation procedure sound needlessly gross !
* sniiiiiiff *
How about go for it , smart guy ! You made the Earth too perfect ! Sure you can take me out now but in a few million years a new species will develop that'll make you wish i was still around !
THAT'S AWESOME AND I NEED TO BORROW THAT
I've got to start thinking these things through .
This i claim !
That God has to be the biggest fanboy ever ! Who knows more about every Star Trek episode than God ? Who knows more about each and every comic , anime and manga series EVER CONCEIVED than God ? He's like this ultimate obsessive fanboy nerd !
It is the perfect solution !
You too provide no value to me , young woman ! That is why I stomp you with impunity .
I promised myself I wouldn't cry , but I cried ! It was a beautiful wedding . Are you going to see the brides ?
The BOTH of us being here to talk about it is even more improbable . Anything anyone ever does , no matter how predictable , is among the least likely things to have ever happened ! !
But then I'd be backup me , I'd have no memories of reading the other book !
Of course ! All I failed to realize was that if my movie existed then no other film need ever again be made , as the medium of motion picture will have , at last , achieved perfection !
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE .
" and who knew
" Your rapts are pretty bad and that's a fact / You can't quite say 'em with your dignity intact "
I . . . um , I just stood up too fast and then I passed out . Don't spread it around , though , okay ? It's kinda UNMANLY .
Porker !
TRUE . But I miss it when it's not those times when I do that !
THE BEST NON - CLASSICAL STATES OF MATTER
Star Trek and Star Wars are two different universes , literally : physics works differently in each of them ! The Falcon flies like it's in atmosphere , DESPITE THE FACT IT'S CLEARLY IN SPACE . In contrast , Trek ships generally meet each other on a fixed axis , like they're in water !
Attention everyone ! You should not listen to these people ! !
Pi goes on with a bunch of crazy numbers forever ! You can start counting the digits of pi and never stop , and DIE , and your last words will be " Man I should've taken breaks for eating and poops ! ! "
" You were not the first "
EXCUSE ME , WE ALREADY SAID * SIGH *
Earth is under attack ! And when Mary Straw's family is vapourized by aliens , she may well be the last Earthling left alive . Now , she's taking down the aliens , alone , piece by piece . That's . . . The Last Straw . Oh WOW do I wish I had the drive and focus to make my ideas become reality !
well , i dunn because i got so flustered from my mistake that i ended up just going home , empty - handed
THAT'S on account of how some people want a woman - hug , and that is one hug I can't provide on my own .
Darkness cannot drive out darkness : only FRIGHT can do that ? Done !
Here lies T - Rex : He lived his life well / and tried to understand .
Oh , and a headache too ! This is how my story ends : not in a bang but a sniffle . For shame !
Personally , I'm just flattered you're hanging out with us !
ETHNIC FOOD ? ?
Okay . I guess that's what I'm going to spend my life doing today .
Getting out of bed can be dangerous .
There's PROBABLY a downside to this that I'm not seeing ?
Sometimes I can't tell when you're being sarcastic .
. . . Seriously , it's like you're inventing new genres all the time . What's this ? Fanfic autobio ?
It's like a switch went off in my head . This radio station was all bragging on itself , saying " Kewl 105 : WE ROCK ! " and my first thought was " Like a moored boat ? Is it cool now to sway back and forth , like a boat tied to a dock by a length of rope ? "
Top hats are those ones that are easy to draw !
" Spend some of your finite life pretending that it did ! "
Sometimes , even the most awesome of us get lonely ! And I should know !
What's up , Champ ? Something bothering you ?
I'm busy ! !
Don't you mean , " This is why YOU shouldn't think about religion that hard " ?
It's totally true ! They're like - all gums !
That's slang , right ?
It's no trouble !
Constantly .
IF YOU FOUND THIS WALLET , IMAGINE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO'D CARRY AROUND THIS COMIC IN IT . KINDA MAKES YOU WANT TO RETURN THEIR WALLET , HUH ? GIVE THEM A CALL , THEIR NUMBER IS _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ !
But what's the narrative ? You can't just have two people chasing each other .
" YOU = COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPERT " NOW EVALUATES TO TRUE
Hah hah hah ! It's good gossip !
Eating's the gift that keeps on giving !
We're eating them like CRAZY .
What's your new year's resolution , T - Rex ?
And I was once a tweenager too , so I don't want any tween tricks played on me ! Alright , tweens ?
Have there been any research into this ?
LATER , T - REX SEARCHES TWITTER FOR " oh no now I'm dead , lol " :
Which ?
Well THAT worked because we forgot most of what happened then ! But with everything recorded forever now ( THANKS , FACEBOOK AND THE NSA ) we have enough data for expertise in SINGLE DAYS . Questions about October 26th 2015 will be answered by the dude with a PhD in Applied and Theoretical October 26th 2015 Studies !
Little does who know what ?
Replaced ! Replaced with a healthy respect for the ENVIRONMENT .
And when you leave , you disconnect from the cyber - netic machinery and become a regular dude !
I'm sad on the inside !
Yes . . . TOO BAD INDEED .
HOW TO REVIEW A BOOK
It's no good . Everything tastes bad and the rest could fly out any dang minute ! !
Couldn't they all be describing the same shared desire for an understanding of what's bigger than ourselves ?
I do indeed !
" Miracle " is semantically widened : it's no longer CLASSIC impossibilities ( two objects occupying the same space ) but also just merely unlikely stuff . And it's not even " body cured itself of disease " unlikely . I'm talking " cute cat survived car accident " . " Favorite hat found " . " Lady got a job she kinda wanted " .
LATER : SOMEBODY ELSE OWNS THE RIGHTS TO LASSIE
Difficulty in finding monogamous partners , if everyone else wants piece ( s ) on the side ( s ) ?
I find it exquisitely funny to give someone a nickname that is at odds with said person's true identity .
Honestly , I kinda understand ? ?
SURE WHY NOT
But to compare , the number of atoms in the universe is EVEN MORE . Let's lowball it and it's at least 10 ^ 80 : that's one followed by eighty zeroes ! And that means that the percentage of the atoms in the universe that's ALL ME is . . . zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
METHOD 3 : DATE YOUR BEST FRIEND'S SIBLINGS !
SUSANNA
She said she's going to be wearing a pink sweater . I'm supposed to meet her at the restaurant at 8 : 00 !
Every trip would start with identities being inserted into official records : a twenty - - year - old travelling to 1950 means going back to 1930 to insert birth records , and trips after that to establish education , work history , etc . It's tons of prep for one trip !
MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE
Well , OBVIOUSLY .
This - you know this is a terrible idea , right ?
T - Rex , it is I , Sherlock Holmes ! I deduced an elementary way to become real , just to ask you to stop writing your story !
I have a new problem . Now I have come into possession of several kilograms of Nazi memorabilia !
Yeah , he was . It's where the ant from the last fable got his food .
- an enviable lifestyle -
What's this ?
It is the essential paradox of the restaurateur !
And we covered how any series of binary digits ( called bits ) can be transformed into a number . But these numbers are really large ! They take a long time to send to someone . Luckily , it's possible to send any number , and therefore any file of ANY size , using only two
KNIFE to meet you , gentlemen ! ! Sorry if I flew off the HANDLE . And now , I BLADE you adieu !
That " bad dude " thing was from a video game
( Left foot , stomp house . ) Or perhaps " Outstandingly Creative Dialogue " . . . . . Hey Dromiceiomimus , did you hear ? Utahraptor thinks I am " One cool Dude " !
Well , I like fresh vegetables , including corn .
Oh , he swapped enemies with Superman . Supes was able to round up Batman's enemies quickly , and Batman made quick work of all Superman's enemies too . They'd prepared for a strong alien vulnerable to Kryptonite and not a smart human who didn't care about tiny green rocks . Crime was over , the end !
You know what ? You should be the one doing the talking here !
Well , this could mean he's not omnipotent anymore !
The sun rises on an unhappy . technologically underdeveloped world . Old racisms from thousands of years ago are still prevalent , conflicts that would otherwise have been completely forgotten still used as justification for reprisals . Positions of power have been held for hundreds , even thousands of years by one person : when assassination isn't an option , jobs are left only when they're no longer interesting ! Society ossifies .
Stephen Hawking is a smart guy ; it makes sense he'd get there first . However , did he ever say maybe time tourists are ALREADY walking among us , but they've disguised themselves so well that we've never noticed ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Well , you should take me with you , so I can keep you out of trouble .
Come on , T - Rex , you know better ! Science is about being empirically ACCURATE , which might not be the same thing as being true . Plus your senses could be lying to you , you could be a brain in a jar , etc . . If you're going to be verificationist , you're going to need a pretty impregnable definition of " truth " .
. . . Except you weren't there and were born decades after this all took place .
Hooray for Occam's Razor !
T - Rex , is that you ?
Yep , I definitely think I got some feelings on me . And as a man who inures himself to all but the most entertaining of emotions , I am neither inclined nor equipped to deal with these feelings !
I - um . Wow !
Breadmatic is a box because that is ROBOTICALLY DETERMINED to be the optimal shape for bread production , okay ?
Ah well , no bigs . I'll just start a brewery called " Responsibly " . Then when other people advertise beers and put " Please Drink Responsibly " at the bottom of their ads , suddenly they're advertising for ME instead !
Seriously !
# 1 : TELEGRAPH
Ah , solipsism . The belief that only one's self exists ! Everything and everyone else are just a projection of my imagination . I made them up ! Who invented all the arts and sciences ?
Um , TO SOLVE CRIMES ? ?
Star Trek ! Star Trek : The Next Generation ?
THEN MAY GOD HELP US ALL
I'm on it ! !
Aw man , SERIOUSLY ? ?
Alright everyone !
T - REX IN : " A CONTRACT WITH GOD "
Yeah ! See ?
Sounds like another emotional roller coaster . . .
. . . You could dig a hole .
Seriously though , only ask him about science stuff , okay ?
Anyway ! Relationships are for the young and the criminally insane . What's of real importance is that I saw a car dealership ad yesterday advertising that " no reasonable offer will be refused " !
I've always found them to be pretty sensual .
But you'll ESPECIALLY be able to bluff your way through Star Trek related conversations !
And piloting the crop duster PERSONALLY . I tell you , wasting food : the manliest thing in the world !
You're arguing that to get alien races to contact us , we should produce POTATO CHIPS that taste like what we imagine EATING THEIR BODIES IS LIKE .
MUCH LATER :
No , no ! THE sun !
Our first letter comes from . . . Johnny the Ghost ? ? What ?
All you can eat ?
Neatly pressed shirts . Really ?
Pretty sure I just ate some spider eggs ! !
Has that ever happened to you ?
The time : 4th century BCE , a . k . a . " history times " ! The place : GREEKTOWNE 2000 , which is what Greece May have been called in those days , assuming all records of this name have all been lost or destroyed since then .
The idea of a soundtrack to a life is a stupid idea . You're just going to come across a band of musicians that wants to follow you around ?
Weddings are full of ladies on the look out for a single blade . Ladies who have found the wine .
A lovely name for a lovely person !
But that's just popularity ! And being popular isn't the same as being great . High school and the weekly top 40 countdown taught me that !
Hah , if you felt as serious about climate change as you do about the mall , we'd have that settled in no time !
TWO HOURS LATER :
No , I just don't care for it !
An ageless elder god slumbers in the Arctic , sole remnant of a long - dead , unknowable race . His body is not of flesh and blood , but of bones , teeth , and cartilage , barely contained in a straining red and white suit : a shambling parody of life .
Maslow says I can only maximize my full potential and achieve the highest state of being in one way : realization of self .
Dude , I'VE ALREADY FOUND ONE .
T - REX WHAT ABOUT VIDEO GAMES
I thought it was just my hilarious nickname for a sex thing !
PHILOSOPHY COMICS
These remarkable tracks are joined by those of an adult Utahraptor who apparently stopped and
Okay , so you've got a talking baby .
Hah ! Looks like you thought wrong !
LATER T - REX GOES OUT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS :
Haha ! See what I did there , Dromiceiomimus ? I implied that socialism is flawed because people don't really have a motivation to share with each other .
> yes
Wow , you've entirely ripped off Hobbes' Leviathan , in which he says EXACTLY THIS .
Alright then . Well . Back to the card , huh ?
a choose - your - own - adventure comic
I find it doubtful that you've ever revenged yourself on animals in such a way !
Okay , so we're hanging out , and I say " T - Rex , I'm gonna go nap in your bed . "
Friggin' zeitgeists , eh ?
Your email address ! It's -
" I've always seen you as the mother I never had . "
You know what we do in photos ? SMILE .
To be or not to be . . .
THE TRUTH OF LIF IS THIS NO MATTER WHO YOU KISS
NO , Dromiceiomimus . They are NON - NESTING .
THE EROTIC VAMPIRE STORY , by me , T - Rex !
What could possibly go wrong from telling off the ENTIRE UNIVERSE I'M BEING SARCASTIC THE DOWNSIDES ARE GLARINGLY OBVIOUS
Because too much has changed !
Never !
Why would you say something like that ? And why now ?
Oh , I know it !
aw dang
Someone must have gotten it right by now !
There are lots of animals that can spit venom !
Do me !
This was very disappointing for a lot of reasons !
One day scientists invent a way to download our entire brains into robot bodies !
IT'S LIKE LICKING A MIRROR
In fact , we do it all the time !
The first was physical
Which the hell evolutionary forces are responsible for plants having thorns on 'em ? ?
Oh , history . Aren't there ANY figures from 2000 years ago that share all our current modern - day beliefs ?
With new understandings coming from the field of Science , we no longer have to give God all the credit for creating the Universe !
You've creeped yourself out ? NO WORRIES . Just restore YOURSELF too . Save scum your own life !
Nope ! And then I compounded it by telling Dromiceiomimus that I had something extra special for her . And OH MAN , now you know my secret . I'm out of control !
Yaaaay
WELL WHAT IF THE ANSWER WAS NEGATIVE , T REX ? YOU WOULD HAVE TO NOT EXIST ! AND MAN , LIKE , WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE FOR YOU LATELY
THAT'S . . .
It is the # 1 best sentence it is possible to say
. . . and make them think it's their idea !
But T - Rex , maybe I like cherries and you like icing . It doesn't have to be equal to be fair !
No ! FILLED WITH THE LOST SOULS OF THOSE WHO SWAPPED OUT AND NEVER SWAPPED BACK . Once Super Mario is there , he wants to stay . He gathers firepower , different suits : all to prevent him from swapping again . But if he fails , Mario returns : a Mario who now understands life is a gift , not to be traded away , but to be lived to the fullest .
Hey , good buddy !
Man ! Are you going to tell us what you read in the news or not ?
Sesquipedalian !
Social programs DO work on the causes ! !
THIS IS AWESOME AND YOU ARE AWESOME TOO
Rawr ! I represent nature and cannot be controlled ! Watch as I destroy this house , representing humanity's folly !
Tired of baked ? Fry them !
The only reason you can do some of it yourself is that there's a whole dentistry infrastructure supporting you , my friend !
The name seems at odds with the emotion !
( It was seriously awesome ! )
He's talking up Ginger Peanut , Kid Detective !
Somehow word got out that I'm a Nazi Pin Guy and now I have everyone else's Nazi pins . And flags . And uniforms and boots and chapeaus . I basically have a WWII Re - Enactment Society in my basement , Dromiceiomimus . BUT ONLY FOR ONE SIDE .
I am a fan of knowing things ! Generally , the more things you know , the better prepared you are for someone asking " Hey , do you know all about 18th century literature ? "
Wait , when I put it that way it sounds kinda dumb ! !
To the library ! It's this way . I'm pointing to it with my fingers .
What about workflow analysis ? What about the work triangle ?
It's okay .
THE PRESENT
Will take over the world !
WHATTT
Exactly . Hence , pasta !
LOVE COMICS
WHAT'S GOING ON T - REX
Hello everybody ! If you stopped having relationships , maybe you'd stop having relationship problems !
Yes it does . This just in : yes it does INDEED .
Oh & # 8211 ; thanks , but never - mind . I had one of those before , and it turns out the magic was in me , all along .
In the future , computers will do a lot of things for us , and maybe they'll be robots , unless we mess up and then it's all horses and swords . Maybe mutants ? Weird ! It's really hard to say .
It is definitely a beautiful day ! Hooray ! !
Does he succeed ?
" Tweens " .
I agree such a name might colour a child's life !
What's that ?
And I think you area really great , just - just super boss , ultimate amazing .
Attention , please , everyone ! I've done some reading about the brain and I discovered there's a part of it called the " amygdala " !
which was really more of a complete rebuild as the new ship was dozens of meters longer ,
Someone broke in and added new last sentences to all the books at the library !
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THERE WAS ONE HOUR LEFT BEFORE THE WORLD EXPLODED
Aw man , what the hell ?
I think it's because water expands when it's frozen and so the can is under pressure , and there's a little melted juice at the top ? I don't know . But they're on the list ! Also : 1970s American popular culture .
Pfft . Death's old hat , T - Rex ! Birth is where it's at .
Long - range readings suggest this light somehow destroys H2O molecules on contact , absorbing nucleonic energy as fuel for further charged - photonic output . As we're each over 50 % water , any direct exposure to " Rudolph " is to be avoided .
Hey Jude !
Sadness flavoured chips !
Can I come ?
That's what interest is , T - Rex ! It's rent .
Why do they make so many mistakes ?
And when they do they can't be unsatisfying , like when it turned out you were dreaming about that Dromiceiomimus bomb sister thing . Just as you're dreaming right now . Wake up T - Rex ! ! ONLY YOU ARE A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO RESCUE THE PRESIDENT !
It's the perfect plan !
Fair like pretty or fair like equality ? The word has overloaded semantic duality .
But you have to promise to let ME choose the time period , and you're not allowed to try to set things up so you become king , alright ?
Utahraptor , I'm an idea man . Please give me an idea so that I can write an amazing story about it , okay ?
That is such a made - up bet ! I owe you zero cases of pop .
So a friend of mine got a cell phone !
Okay , I'll say it : I know another T - Rex . I don't know him SUPER well , but we've been on a few dates .
T - REX DID YOU JUST MAKE A PI / PIE JOKE BECAUSE I WARNED YOU I WOULD SHUT DOWN THE UNIVERSE IF THAT HAPPENED
That's binding , right ?
Great , you're so fast and so strong that you alone are capable of preventing - anything ! EVERYTHING . And great , your senses are acute enough that you're super - aware , too ! Which means that when something bad happens WORLDWIDE , you know about it and you know only you can stop it . Is that mugging worth flying around the world for ? What about that murder ? Which simultaneous murder on opposite sides of the planet is more important , Superman ? ?
Okay , knowing just one thing , then . Going through life knowing that no matter what , I'm going to win the lottery , for example !
So Kant's Categorical Imperative is more of a meta - directive , right ?
Today I assemble the greatest fighting team the world has ever known , culled from History's Mightiest Mortals !
Sure , it's great to be conscious and be able to envision ourselves and imagine possible futures and make decisions and all that .
So , no !
I guess ?
Or I could just take a vow of silence until I die !
I LOVE biscuits and gravy !
So IT TURNS OUT the shape of our universe has a large effect on how it will age ! If our universe is shaped like a sphere , then gravity could eventually cause it to contract , leading to a " big crunch " in which everything is compressed into a single point ! Crazy ! What's CRAZIER is that this could lead to another big bang , giving us a cyclical universe . Here's a picture of me and Dromiceiomimus . We look happy . Look , I'm going to draw some word bubbles .
Rock Music ! ! ! ! !
Dude , who cares ? We're not investigating our own origins here . WE'RE JUST MAKING DESSERT . All we need is a complete understanding of the universe as it was between time zero and 10 ^ - 43 seconds later and we're set !
BACK TO THE FUTURE
And the REASON these endings have all sucked like whoah is that every single great work of literature employs endings that don't suddenly throw in a SURPRISE TWIST that instantly calls into question your very conception of reality . Anyway , I fixed 'em .
I don't see what the big deal about it is ! I BARELY feel funkier .
Okay I'm putting in my will that you can't ever do a video epitaph for me .
. . . UM , CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BIRTH OF YOUR FIRST CHILD ? ?
But that doesn't solve the problem !
1 ) Ability to stop being sad on demand
WITH THE BABY CARRIAGE ? YEAH !
I recently heard about an event called the Race For The Cure !
According to your fancy logic , perhaps , but I happen to live in the REAL world .
Back when I was in middle school , I used to go to the computer labs and add all sorts of common typos and misspellings to their spell check dictionaries , like 'teh' and 'acceptible' and 'amoung' and 'tahn' . Hee hee !
When police do reports their bosses are all " cool facts bro , but let's add mood first . Is it a dark and stormy night ? Is it the anniversary of some creepy murder from history ? " and the cop is like " No , " and the boss slides the report back across the table and is like " Maybe it is though is what I'm implying . "
Since the phrase now means " con artist " , nobody wants to be a snake oil salesman ! But I presume there was a point when a man could procure some snake oil and go door - to - door selling it , and maybe those guys wrecked it for the rest of us . Maybe they were all chumps . MAYBE they were all , in fact , SUPERCHUMPS .
Shakespeare ! The correct answer is " no ! "
Oh crap ! Has that started ? !
maaaaaaaaaaaan
Okay MAYBE I've been talking about it a lot lately . MAYBE .
Do you remember it , Dromiceiomimus ? How amazing it was ? How it was awesome , in both the colloquial AND old - schoool biblical sense ?
Ahhhhhh ! Run away !
It seems to be there are some DESIGN FLAWS , so , with respect , I am proposing we address this issue head - on and fix them . First up : spines . Make 'em so they don't have problems anymore , am I right ? Someone should do that finally .
I'm made of meat , so I get weaker AND forgetful as I get older ! !
Long past ?
Spider - Man was being gross and rude !
But come on , if you want to mess with the Big Bang I'ma shoot you in the head ! !
But I honestly don't think you'll be that guy . You'll probably end up doing something different than you expect right now , but that doesn't mean you've FAILED AT LIFE .
Friggin' Cap'n Lib .
SOMEONE CAME UP WITH IT FIRST ?
I've never bought a drink for a stranger in a bar !
Well then , I'd best begin my preparations for time - travel ! I'll stop that Utahraptor of 3 days ago from telling the past me about his theory .
Room 501 doesn't have a door yet . It's Not Implemented ! And there's a big hole where room 410 should be , because it's Gone .
What was that all about , dude ?
No , brain auto - cannibalistic sea squirts . Black swallowers ?
T - REX'S GUIDE TO WEIGHT LOSS
That's pretty clever , my friend !
Where'd everybody go ?
See , I have a lot of sex .
So , I thought I'd cook enough for the next day as well !
you will never defeat us ! AIE !
So - heck . Batteries ?
Well , um ,
FROM MORRIS'S PERSPECTIVE !
TODAY IS EXTREMELY SPECIAL , T - REX . TODAY IS THE DAY WE REDEFINE THE UNCANNY VALLEY SO THAT IT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO SEX !
And ? AND ? ?
We do it ALL THE TIME .
This is because many of the innovations in his Analytical Engine , such as conditional branching and a separation of processing and memory , were left to be re - discovered by a new generation of pioneers !
Oh wow ! Bodies can DO that ? ?
TIPS FOR JOGGERS
Aren't you always saying how you wish you could play your MP3s ?
Oh , actually , about that : they're rebranding it , T - Rex . It's now referred to as " Golden Crisp " in most major markets .
And then talking about my INTERESTS ? ?
I looked at your profile . I dunno . It seems weird to say " Sorry , I've already got enough friends " , but I wouldn't even be saying that . I'd be saying , " Sorry , I've already got enough - - strangers ? Who are aware of what movies I liked when I set this up years ago ? "
Pardon me ?
our last words
Oil is totally a renewable resource !
i miss my friend utahraptor
GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE ! !
T - REX IT'S BEEN A WHILE
> no
Well , alright , then I guess I'll just end up dating someone who WANTS a hella creepy date with a stranger !
Pretension ! Ah , pretension !
I have lots of my own money so I can eat cookie dough whenever I want . I don't even have to cook it !
Our last hope is a reindeer whose red nasal radiation destroys water molecules and whose linguistic aptitudes mean he can be convinced to work for us . " Rudolph " has been released from lead - lined containment and is flying towards the pole now .
Transspecies communication isn't that amazing though !
I believe I'll offer some advice on employing everyday filmic techniques !
Hello and welcome to TalkToADog . com . You are being connected to a dog !
Is this . . . RACISMS ? ?
I am going to call SHENANIGANS .
today's technique : LEITWORTSTIL
It's not that bad ! !
I see . Can I return my body for a new one ?
Truly , I am the greatest thing ever !
Yeah , but BEFORE that , it could have been anywhere ! What if it was a poo bug ?
Dude , I know what a DJ is .
People laugh at typos in heaven ? !
" Like us on Facebook ! " " Talk to the hand ! " " I will if you like us on Facebook ! " " I will if you address your comments towards my hand ! "

That's cute , but " glutens " are really the industry term for the trace amount of feces legally permitted in ground or processed meats . The animals are processed whole , which means their intestines - usually with animal waste still inside them - get added to the mix . Interestingly , gluten - free foods aren't ACTUALLY gluten free : they've just been chemically treated to sterilize the fecal output .
the end .
Do the characters even react to the explosions at all ?
Never lose a baby , because if you do , you might be forced to pay for the loss with one of your own babies !
Originally it meant " a small horse " !
There's no way that would work , T - Rex ! No way !
IT'S THE BEST RELIGION
I DON'T KNOW WHY T - REX
I know one thing that puts us ( living people made out of meat ) above machine intelligences .
A sound just came out of my body . wav
Yeah , this isn't making me feel any better , T - Rex !
ACTUALLY IN HELL YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT WHATEVER YOU WANT ONLY WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT YOU HAVE TO SING SONGS WITH ALL THE LYRICS REPLACED BY " PARTY "
- there's still stuff you can't buy ! The sun could explode , ASTEROIDS COULD HIT , and so on !
Hey , when you're done eating , you know what happens ? You push out WASTE through a HOLE in your BODY . A HOLE , Utahraptor .
I am making life interesting ! Also , did you know the Devil likes grape juice from concentrate ?
Or is he instead really just totally fake OH SNAP TWIST ! !
. . . TWO DAYS AGO :
awww darn
ESSENTIALIST : You have to eat food or you'll die . If you eat this food , then you won't die from not eating a food , at least for a little while .
BACKSTORY : T - REX HAS TRIED TO START FEUDS WITH KELSEY GRAMMER BEFORE , BUT KEEPS LOSING HIS NERVE .
But won & # 8217 ; t you be remembered as someone that nobody actually liked ?
THERE !
Or MAYBE all my friends are tourists from the future , sent to observe me !
Ohhhh ! That makes sense !
Oh , God was claiming that the English word with the most consecutive double letters is " bookkeeper " but I was letting him know that it's actually -
I am ! I'm saying what NOT to do !
Well , I think my points are still valid . I don't know about you , but I do sleep in the " egg fetus " position .
It seems unlikely !
So far , yeah .
I can't believe you think " there4 " is the future of " therefore " !
gurb .
And then what happens ?
You don't care about the non - hotties ?
What if I called it " Cloacademia ! ( The Cloaca Being Our Single Opening Where The Waste Goes Out And The Sex Goes In ) ? "
T - REX VISITS A GHOST TOWN .
For serious !
He's just got this big interpersonal thing where he's not quite sure what's appropriate , and because of that he transgresses unwritten societal boundaries all the time . I think we've all done that a little , and it's embarrassing !
Humans should be kept in rooms between 19 and 24 degrees Celsius !
And then you throw the page away ! The symbolism : SO PERFECT .
Um , because his first robot , S . H . E . R . L . O . C . K . , was currently TERRORIZING LONDON ? ?
but a woman just DIED
Ah , the age - old question : what do women want ?
History if full of chumps , you guys ! !
Aha , but were THEY motivated by an acute awareness of their failures and compromises , brought on by the anniversary of my birth ? ?
This is sort of a first world problem , yes ?
Like maybe they have a special version of the Heimlich maneuver that can make you poop !
Well ! I guess that gives us more time to talk about - I don't know . Dogs ? I guess we could talk about dogs .
T - Rex , did you even try making up your own characters ?
Alternate timelines who HAVE super sizes are laughing at us right now . You realize that , right ? ?
But rather than point out the failings of others , I will first endeavour to improve myself !
yours too
Um , this just in : I have a new rhetorical device at my disposal !
That's true ! And . . . and that means as long as they're still around , then I'm NOT the worst person ever ! Oh my God , now I have a perfectly selfish reason to be thankful for all the jerks !
However , in most cases things are independent . The results of the previous roll has no bearing on the current roll !
My life - ALL LIVES , in fact - would be measurably improved if I had a sweet accent ! FACT .
Shoot me and I'll catch the bullets with my teeth , beat you up , spit the bullets on you and say " Next time , shoot me whhen I'm yawning " . And if I don't do it in our universe , it's only buecause I'm doing doing it somewhere else !
EPIPHANY COMICS
Why are you doing this to me
We dug up actual consecrated remains and ground 'em into dust and painted with them , OKAY ? ? And we kept it up for generations , stopping only when the corpses ran out . I don't know what this says about us as a people , but we've all just got to live with it . PAINTING WITH GROUND - UP BODIES : A A PART OF OUR HERITAGE .
I'm pretty much history's greatest dinosaur
I missed my friends !
Well , I'd love to party with YOU , Dromiceiomimus , but you're making that REALLY HARD . I don't even know if your work lets friends party there ! !
Hmm . . . maybe start with functional programming so state isn't a concern ?
he didn't dial the wrong number and then break up with you because he thought you were somebody else with the same name that he no longer wanted to be cheating on you with , is the thing
MEMENTO MORI FOR EVERYONE .
Expiry dates on food and juice products ?
I have written the spookiest ghost story ever ! It is called , " The Man Who Died And Came Back As A Ghost " .
NOW IT'S THANKSGIVING !
" Just do what you think is best ! "
In the 1600s scientists from history were discovering a lot of things about science ! It was an exciting time to be a scientist from history !
BABY WANTS HIS BOTTLE :
From now on T - Rex is " Namby Pam " .
Why , you'd be left with an undead body but a dead brain !
Well , he's a gruff man , but he knows his spaceships . His name ? Captain Flannigan O'Spaceships .
You're off by almost 200 times the actual number .
You assume there exists an answer to such cosmic questions !
I find these bases to be highly improbably , Dromiceiomimus !
You're not holding anything . You MADE UP the letter because YOU had the crazy idea , and you're afraid of being called crazy so you attributed it to me , but you'd still like to know if your idea is actually possible .
Also , she's not a monster . She's alive , just like you or I !
In egoism , all your actions are motivated by a desire to make things easy for one person : yourself ! For instance , I crush this house because it's in my way . My actions are justified , thanks to egoism !
But if it were true , how come we can't see in the dark ?
Wow ! That's amazing ! Too bad Larry Niven came up with it already .
I will be a bouncer !
" All up in my earhole " ? That's disgusting ! " Earhole " ! Man ! Friendship annulled ! You're gross !
OMNIBUS : heads up , everyone ! This is NOT an all - encompassing bus : a universal bus that , once boarded , contains within every joy , every sorrow , every hope and every fear , every potential self that you could ever hope to be . Rather it's a collection of smaller things , like an omnibus bill or a book containing other books .
IT'S THE SAME SONG AGAIN !
FRUSTRATION COMICS
Not to mention your pores !
" Regular " cars are the ones you see all the time !
I could've SWORN that " unsay " was something a person can actually do .
Well nevermind then
No way am I listening to you write fan fiction ABOUT YOURSELF , dude . This is like the ultimate level of onanism ! You're supposed to do that stuff ALONE .
Utahraptor you are INCORRIGIBLE .
Dino - Goggles : Check ! Well , that's everything . I guess I'm ready to go back through time .
. . . Whoah . Maybe ? I mean , I want to say no , but there's no way for us to detect a difference . Whoah .
ha ha ! [ [ both Utahraptor and T - Rex are being imagined by T - Rex ] ]
Can cockroaches throw up ? I think I read somewhere that they can't throw up .
No way ! Culture ruled when we were kids ! !
Short for " I'm gonna " , itself short for " I'm going to " !
Didodecarestandardizational : something referring to or about the restandardization process in a way that is related to 2 groupings of 12 .
It's a heartwarming story about two children growing up in a simpler time , a time when gender roles were clear and children played hopscotch on their way home from school !
Adding " you may quote me " after any sentence makes me seem awesome ! You may quote me .
Life's funny sometimes , Utahraptor
Comedy ensues !
Oh ! And my subconscious for these waking nightmares that haunt me still !
Sorry ? Could your vocal chords and mouth repeat that ?
" I wish death was reversible but only for good people like me . "
OH MY GOD , IT ALL FITS
So what's left ?
Isn't it just the novelty of it that appeals to you though ?
Aww ! T - Rex , that would be terrible . I love you
The totally unpredictable is also void of interest !
Let's do it , Utahraptor ! Let's see what it's like to LITERALLY stare into space . Let's go out on spacewalks with only our space jammies between us and the universe around us . Let's take off our space helmets real quick just to see what it's like ! !
HUNDREDS OF YEARS LATER :
Me either !
Dominatrix ?
oh , right !
The wind is awesome . So awesome ! You can stand on the edge of a cliff , leaves swirling around you , staring out in the wind - into DESTINY - and it's just great . Everything feels dramatic and apocalyptic and awesome . It's WAY better than trying to stare out into destiny during a snow storm , believe you me !
Forsooth , I verily doth wantus that !
Do they need Powerful word - parsing in Uganda ? Try PERL's " Regular Expressions " !
But that's only in English dudes !
Text messaging !
Anyone could have come up with that !
I went to University with her . She said at the time that she found me handsome , and I said that it was " probably just her own ideas of attractiveness interacting with my own personality and unchangeable genetics . "
People STILL think " For sale : baby shoes , never worn " is the saddest six word story ! This is OJBECTIVELY FALSE ( " Everyone just pretends to like you " is even SADDER ) ( AND TRUE , OH SNAP ) , but six words is straight - up amateur hour .
1960s : the intended purpose of boots is , at last , discovered by Americans .
No , I got you something ! My . . . affection ?
At the top of our list are plasmas ! OBVIOUSLY . Plasmas are ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE GAS , and that is extremely awesome . Lightning is plasma and lightning RULES , therefore plasma easily takes our coveted # 1 spot .
That sounds like a pretty useless time machine !

today's technique : AUTHOR INSERTION
I am sincerely puzzled
Maybe after the subs sandwiches we could go to a water lake beach shore ?
Well , I'm going to be an adult , Utahraptor ! I'm going to memorize ALL SORTS of useful facts about my body !
Utahraptor , do you - - do you ever get sad ?
Yeah , I'm cool too ! It's nice just to see you , you know ?
Just write : " You know how sometimes you can't fall asleep because you keep going over the events of the day in your head ? Isn't that the coolest ? ? Well , check THIS out : the imaginary person you're reading about is doing that now ! I KNOW : SO AWESOME . "
I AM NOT EVEN JOKING .
I woulda thought you'd drink the juice .
As do I !
Yep ! The duplicate is identical in every regard . The ray examines the object at the quantum AND subquantum levels and thanks to the twin fists of Actual Science and Heisenberg Compensators , makes a perfect copy , indistinguishable from the original !

Our zombie woman is Patient Zero of the zombie outbreak , which suggests to the attentive reader that we're using an infection model of zombification . Let R0 be the threshold quantity of infections . If R0 is less than one , then the infection will die out . If it's equal to one , then the disease will remain endemic in the population . And the more above one R0 is , the greater the epidemic !
I'm trial for imagining my computer to be a babe and my hands are full !
You're justifying laziness through minimizing inefficiencies ?
And YouTube is a thing too ! And it's like - - what if you took Twitter and smushed it into YouTube ? What comes out the other end ? I'll tell you what : a site where you can upload movies , but the movies can't have more than 140 characters in them ! AND BY " CHARACTERS " I MEAN " NAMED ROLES " ! !
So what's in it , T - Rex ?
After years correcting people , I am finally conceding this ground . While it is ENTIRELY FACTUAL that Mary Shelley never gave the monster a name as part of a grand symbol for the poor creature's lack of identity , I guess that was pretty much her bad . She should've called him " Stitchy Fleshface " or " Bubba Unhugga " because it turns out we're ENTIRELY UNWILLING to have reanimated flash walking around without sticking a name on it first .
Hey man , if you don't want to share your secret with me , that's fine . I'm not gonna pry !
I have no { { censored } } clue !
Are you alright ?
My window's at the head of my bed so that's where the words would come from .
Once upon a time there was a bashful cat named " Neutron " . He had so many fingers .
Utahraptor , am I glad to see you ! Listen can you explain to God that His joke would be funny if we wore pants , but we don't wear pants , so He can stop talking about it ?
. . . or should I say - ACTUALLY EXISTED ? ?
So the past is an illusion , eh ?
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS IN SPACE NOW
Maybe we'll insist that love can't be defined , that it's beyond the reach of rational thought , that we fall in and out of love in a way that is completely beyond our control . All we can do is hope for the best and hold on for the ride , because it's Cupid's arrow straight through the heart , striking anywhere at any time ! It's a lot like an axe murderer , or a brain aneurysm . Or a stroke . Or dementia .
I SAY THIS AS GOD AND TRULY WITHOUT HYPERBOLE
I woke up the other day and realized I want to earn . . . SPORTS POINTS ? ?
Sounds like he's having the more interesting evening .
One day Peta Parka II - the daughter of my original character Peta Parka - was bitten by a radioactive . . .
The problem I have is that so many people claim to have found if , but the odds that you'd ever meet that one person AND that they'd be available , willing , and of the right gender and sexual orientation are really pretty small . CONCLUSION : a lot of people must be faking it !
I'm not sure that's how pantheism works ! Isn't it more like , we're all cells in the " body " of a divine universe ?
Hah ! I'm PRETTY SURE I can avoid tripping down the stairs if it means LIVING FOREVER .
Nostalgia for the present ?
Writing is , like , way super easy !
Guess who had their first dream of flying last night ?
You're damn right ! !
In conclusion : manipulate others , events , and yourself to get what you want , the end
Oh , no bigs , I have another rule that says it's okay to kill if I really want to . More precisely , it says " harm may be done if it's an effect of a greater good " !
That's okay ! Come on : living forever ? I could do anything ! I could do EVERYTHING - twice !
But I assure you that for whatever reason , each of them saw it fit to render a copyright - infringing vision of a universe where we live the astonishing dreams of Finger and Kane .
HAH HAH ME NEITHER
I just like the excitement of giving people presents !
AND ALSO THAT WE SAY " MESSAGE RECEIVED , PLAN OMEGA BLACK PHASE TWO COMMIT " " GO GO GO "
We should go ! It's so great . You get a glimpse of what the world would be like if it all went wrong , and we all died tomorrow !
Only the MISTAKES !
Well , that neither proves nor disproves my theory !
Wow , that was a terrible movie . Definitely one of the top 50 worst films ever !
The point is , in today's modern culture , subscribing to magazines is the easiest way to say " Hey . These are the sorts of things I am interested in . I am $ 2 . 50 a month interested in snowmobiles . "
" Happy machine ! "
On a PLANET where INTERROGATION is BANNED
But there is a catch . You still pay taxes - say , a flat tax of 10 % - BUT , the government also pays you enough to survive ! This way there's a guaranteed minimum income - like welfare , but simpler . So if you make only $ 1000 in a year you'll pay $ 100 in taxes , but since the government pays everyone , say , $ 10000 , you'll end up $ 9900 ahead in tax money . As you make more money , you net less from the government , until you end up actually paying taxes !
And they're probably really happy about having a gun that shoots pizzas !
OH MAN , WHAT IF ? ?
Was he an egg salesman , do you think ?
Yeah , like in the fifties ! Everybody was neighbourly in the fifties !
When I look up at lunch instead of a single sun I see millions , their ancient star - light dancing in my eyes because unlike most , mine were open . How can I ever go back , trading the beauty of the universe for one lonely sun ?
" Fine " ?
You could see every time you eat delicious sandwiches , organized chronologically !
I didn't expect to find you at a farmer's market . You like corn ?
Yaaaay reality
Damn dude , you know it is !
Your life has fallen into a daily tradition , and you're beginning to notice you're TRADITIONALLY not invited to work functions .
Sweeeet
How is this close to a good idea ?
It's not ! I added in some NARRATIVE TENSION too !
PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON MONOGAMOUS COUPLES :
I understand the concept , T - Rex ! But while it's true that things with small probabilities would be guaranteed to occur , things with zero probability still wouldn't take place , even with infinite time ! And I don't see how you're going to get around the entropy problem .
? when friction first left the planet ? ?
Knock knock !
Exactly , and that's something ! We're not ALL motivated by greed . Some of us are ALSO motivated by pride .
You know what Science's problem is ?
$ 6000 for a plastic skeleton ?
Right . So what makes it different from Lojban then ? Every sentence there has only one meaning , and they wrote software to prove their grammar rules unambiguous .
Man , that'd be SO WEIRD ! I'm glad I'm not home alone right now , where nobody will check on me for hours and hours .
So I am a guy who is really afraid of going crazy . I don't want to go crazy , okay guys ? ?
Though I must caution you . . .
TERROR
Yep ! I'd love to play beachball with you .
ORIGINALLY :
I have no idea .
Get your head in the game , Winston !
This magazine is in Polish . I can't read this .
I have the best idea ! SELLING HUGS . It is a recipe for Instant Profits ! The lonely will pay me three dollars for the Squeezy Special !
That's OK ; I never do them anyway !
You need to do things not just because you might get a sandwich !
I could make some joke about tautological advertisements , but I find them too annoying to laugh at right now .
" REALISTIC TALES OF INSTROSPECTION "
A narrative hook is when you introduce a story with something incredible so your audience will keep reading ! It happens when you're told that in this comic . . . SPIDER - MAN ! WILL ! ! DIE ! ! !
What about people who are named for their species ?
he started it ! !
Well even if it WAS , I could always get a sex change and a new family or something . I don't know ! How nuanced can it be to be a member of a set of two mutually female siblings ?
And then they're officially conscious ?
I'm not really sure that I could invent anything useful , though !
Just fine , thank you !
PS MY MOVIE IS A METAPHOR FOR WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO WHEN NOBODY TEXTED ME THAT THERE WAS A RAD PARTY GOING ON

Then it will be POIGNANT . And BITTERSWEET .
But he's distinguished by his strange nose , which emits radiation through an unknown but presumed organic process . A fraction of this radiation exists at the high end of the visible spectrum , and as such , his " red nose " has been used by Case # 1023 as a guide - always on foggy Christmas Eves .
Oh , really fun and sa - um , I mean . . . " boring " ?
I'll beat him ! !
Emphasis is also awesome . I'd love to watch " 12 Angry MEN ? ? " or " Terminator 2 : Judgment DAY ? ? "
I have a favourite video game company , WHICH SHALL NOT BE NAMED , but which has been working on the same game for the past 12 years . And they just closed down !
Okay , it's time for a TRUE horror story , for reals this time . Prepare yourself to be SO TERRIFIED that your mind breaks ; prepare to be reduced to GIBBERING MADNESS !
ANYWAY OTHER PEOPLE CAN SAY THIS JUST IN SO DON'T SWEAT IT
Aha , but still no sandwich love !
Can it be love a woman feels for managing her time effectively ?
That may be a fact ; it is impossible to say .
So he's not really a man ? Is that what the quotation marks mean ?
HOW TO PICK UP CHICKS
UTAHRAPTOR ?
YEAH , LIKE THAT !
So even if you get a brain transplant without dying , you'd end up being left in a body you couldn't move . This , my friends , is SUBOPTIMAL . Also , the brain is a super sensitive organ and gets damaged really quickly if it doesn't get oxygen . Therefore , brain transplants : super hard . We've never pulled one off here in the mortal world . But what if you had a brain that didn't NEED oxygen ? What if you had a body that didn't FORM scar tissue ?
I would like to date someone ! Someone female ! And also someone . . . perfect ? ?
WELL , for that you'll have to buy my book , " Dudes ! Lesbians ! Guess What ? Here is How to Get Women to Like You " . But since we're friends , I'll give you a sneak peek !
SURPRISE , T - REX ! WE BAKED YOU A CAKE , SHAPED LIKE AN UNCANNY VALLEY VERSION OF YOU .
WHAT ? ! IS T - REX CRAZY ? ? FIND OUT BY READING THE NEXT PANEL !
I have decided that I am starting a bluegrass band !
Later !
You're going to say something stupid and then naively play it off as though everything worked out in your favor .
If you've done that already and ended up here again : I hope you have learnt your lesson .

LET'S LEARN ABOUT . . . CANADA
But because of this , when it comes to reproduction , who's gonna be the mother is up for debate . And it turns out that being pregnant is hard work ! So these worms FIGHT IT OUT , and by " FIGHT IT OUT " I mean they pull out their dagger - like penises and try to stab sperm through the other's flesh .
" THE MIDDLE GROUND "
Awwwwwwwwwwwww !
Female teachers used to be called " teacheresses " ? That's so bizarre !
Small talk is the timeless , beautiful art of talking to someone you've never met and will likely never meet again for a few minutes so you won't seem weird . But the good news is this : Either your partner is a ) one of those people who likes small talk and can therefore carry you along with them ( these are called " extroverts " and this is their only use ) , or b ) as desperate and and terrified as you are .
. . . No way to be sure , really
POSSIBLE BUT INTERESTING : ghosts of PEOPLE don't exist , but ghosts of THINGS do . The ghost rattling chains is actually the CHAINS back from the dead , saying hi the only way they know how ! The ghost in the blurry photo is actually the ghost of some crappy photograph the person was in , in real life !
FOR SOME REASON T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR PUBLISH THEIR COLLABORATIVE STORY ! IT GOES STRAIGHT TO NUMBER 1
Totally spooky , dudes !
Those were indeed good games of " Scrabble " !
By no means Fit for their Purpose as Kings and Queens , the Dinosaurs spread Fear and Incontenience , along with several similar Inconve - niencies , which neither can be Described nor Understood without having first seen one of the Faersome beasts for oneself ; thy Stars are indeed Fortunate , for in to - day's Moderne Age , the only such Animale thy shall see is in a rare Wood - Cut or handsel Picture - Book , where thou art Protected from the joyn'd Devourment and Digestione by the Fictionality of the Beast in question .
It would be cool to be able to flash forward and see what my life would actually be like in ten or twenty years .
I have a great idea for a comic you guys !
Their combination house / fort is called the Space - Time Continuum , obviously ! !
Wait a few years , then load up that old mp3 file and play it for INSTANT RECOLLECTION of who you were and what you felt during that month when this one song got associated with EVERYTHING YOU DID . It works every time !
Anything else about him is PURE SPECULATION , because he died , and everyone he knew died , and everyone they knew died , and then a bunch more died and HERE WE ARE .
" NEWMAN . "

catch !
YOU ARE NOW A FACEBOOK WIZARD
I know , right ? It was a big deal to construct , but they had The Time ( Prof Time is good at architecture AND referring to herself with the definite article ) . And they also had The Space !
Man , that's just because movies have sad narratives ! Music just has a bunch of notes that I am entirely unable to relate to on any emotional level . On account of my untrained ears and my magnificent manly heart ?
And French isn't the only dick here : most Indo - European languages have gendered nouns too . We don't have infinite space in our brains , and speakers of these languages are forced to use up precious neurons remembering whether the moon - THE MOON , ladies and gentlemen - is a boy or a girl . SPOILER ALERT : it's a dude to the Polish and a chick to the French . Woo hoo . Hey , hope you didn't need to remember where you put your keys !
My body temperature matches the environment's to within a small degree !
Hah hah hah !
I do like downloading things , such as website elements or perhaps a song .

" Explore your feelings " ? Shuck that jive , man ! Feelings are for sissies and the elderly !
If I were to be reincarnated , I would like it to be as one of those big machines that eats smaller machines for an audience .
Ok , let me explain . Unlike a typical CYOA with pages that set up different story branches with some detail , these shifting panels have us fly by the seat of our pants ! Each one has to be generic to fit whatever preceded it .
Oh ! And make it so the brain can get exhausted , but then be unable to fall asleep !
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS
Utahraptor , remember when you said I'd " never run out of things to learn about Teri Hatcher " ?
I think it's happening to me ! Waterpark , waterpark , waterpark .
Let's just do it though
Then the next thing you have to do is improve yourself . For example , if you look in the mirror and say " Man , that guy's totally underinformed about world events " , then you should follow the news more .
No , wait !
And kinda sad !
Would you say that not even God Himself could tea us apart ?
You know what ? Forget it . If nobody on this planet wants to support me , then I'll just move to another planet that does .
You could see what the critics say !
. . . Chicken wings ?
Which leaves us with two possibilities :
I keep meaning to , but I'm also super busy with all my ADULT RESPONSIBILITIES . Why have we structured society so that that as soon as you can do all the awesome stuff , you're WAY TOO BUSY to actually do it ? We should get years 20 to 40 off , inclusive ! Youth isn't wasted on the young ! GOING TO WORK IS .
You scored 0 points out of a possible 158 . Thank you for playing Sierra's DINO QUEST !

" Shall " and its derivatives only sound classy because they're so dated and archaic !
First , decide what you want to buy from an internet stranger you'll never meet . For example , I'm hungry , so I want a burger . Now eBay doesn't sell burgers , but it DOES at present offer a plastic bag of 100 doll - sized used plastic burgers . This is a reasonable compromise , so I enter in how much I want to pay , and if I for some reason thought they were worth more than everyone else across the entire internet did , then they're mine !
. . . Sure ?
I don't like it when something bad happens . Well , IN PARTICULAR , I don't like it when something bad happens and people say that " there's a reason " for it happening !
THAT would be entirely awesome !
I AM TOTALLY INTO THIS .
That's no secret , T - Rex ! Maggot debridement has been around since antiquity .
Here's a tip : SOME babies need to learn to cry a little less !
Today is a good day I think for eating hobosnacks ! Hobosnacks are snacks for hobos . I think they're commercially marketed as " Cheetos " !
Aaaugh ! Dammit T - Rex , how many times do I have to tell you not to leave slaughtered iguanodons on the kitchen counter ?
I joke about trends forecasting , but it's actually super interesting ! There are folks whose ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIVES are spent determining what stupid dress colours will be future popular . Okay , that didn't sound that interesting ; I can do better .
What I have compiled is nothing less than . . .
No no , you're pubescent as soon as the changes start ! That's how it works .
Hah ! NOT A PROBLEM . You know all I've ever learnt from feelings ?
Without releasing the friggin' game !
All in all , a good night !
If you could do anything to make a living , what would it be ?
You wanna get a coffee sometime or . . .
ACCIDENTS AND WHAT NOT
Doing what ?
NOPE CAN'T SAY THAT IT DOES
God , do you think I'm a good enough dude to write an opera ?
It's fun to scout out any limits in your wording ( artificial or not ) and , in doing so , hit upon an additional , unfamiliar form of communication ! And it's a joy to find that , with this unusual linguistic format now at your disposal , talking with this constraint is just as normal to you now as talking without it was !
We're getting near the end of the year ! You know what that means . . .
That was an extremely hilarious joke that deserved more laughter than it received .
It was probably just some random neurons firing in my brain !
You are consumed with the inescapable desire to communicate a word found in a dictionary , a song , movie , or book title , or well - known phrase . You friends , similarly , are consumed with the desire to understand what you're trying to say , frantically guessing at every motion you make . This is the reality you now live in . But for how long ? For there's a timer ticking down , and if you don't communicate in time , you DIE .
Because the words have two different origins .
Get the hell out of here , Dromiceiomimus ! The Contamination is right behind me !
Are we dating ?
OH FRIG , MY PHONE
There are already billions of humans to choose from , and seven more are born every second . While your pet human may claim to filter potential sexual partners by personality , gender , sexual orientation , interests , and body type , you don't get to 7 billion simultaneous humans on the planet by bein' choosey .
Anyway yeah now St . Patrick's color is green
I ASK ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE NEUROTOXIN YOU CAN GROW AT HOME ? ?
NO JUST -
Okay , I'm gonna need some proof for that .
How many religions have you started so far , T - Rex ?
What do you want ?
And I wake up , the end !
T - REX IN : PROGRAMMING ADVICE
But then I did a search and I've posted variants of my dinner tweet OVER 15 TIMES and I've posted that exact tweet 3 times , and they've never favourited it before . I dunno .
Aww ! I'm sorry , imaginary dude !
I asked about dogs .
The captain actually gave the order to gun the engines and beach the ship on the shore , but some lifeboats were launched against orders , two of which ended up DRIFTING INTO THE PROPELLERS , with pretty much the results you'd expect .
Man . What the heck am I gonna eat for dinner ?

He did , did he ?
No , that's hunting dinosaurs . Well , I mean , folks used to say humans were the most dangerous game , but humans don't have claws .
MEANWHILE , ONE UNIVERSE OVER :
Yes ! Some people , anyway .
But what if you ended up being sad ?
Pretty wacky !
I think we should get ON THAT already ! !
Another problem is that cliffhangers sometimes don't resolve at all !
Nice " horse " , statue ! !
I'm so tired of all my actions having consequences !
What I want is a theory of truth that's incontrovertible . In fact , I don't want even a THEORY of truth ! I want a fact of truth .
With our powers combined , we'd be unstoppable !

Hey , Dromiceiomimus ! 'Sup ?
That's for the courts to decide , my friend !
Hah , just kidding ! 95 % of the ocean floor has never been seen , and 99 . 5 % of the ocean itself is unexplored ! Dude should be a marine scientist .
No way Dromiceiomimus ! I bet that I would be on average at least KIND of happy .

Perfect ! Dromiceiomimus , your rapper name will be " what's Up Drotimes " , " Droseidon " , or " Born Dromosexual " .
And NOW , your favourite actor supports that charity or cause you like !
What brought this on ? Have you suffered any losses lately ?
I call my new word " sawesome " !
I don't know about writing but I know what I like , and what I like is whole stories built around old sayings !
T - Rex , I fly through a giant pink tunnel , down through a dark hole , into a tremendous blooming flower , and finally around a huge roseate " V " with text beneath it that says " That 'V' stands for 'Vaginas' " .
I just RHETORICALLY FELL ASLEEP .
Somehow , you've found a new rung below plagiarists on the author ladder : " plagiarists who didn't even look at Wikipedia " . Congrats , I guess ?

Hello , my name is T - Rex ! I'm pleased to meet you .
LOBSTERS ? ?
God you answer people's prayers , right ? Folks are always saying how you answer prayers .
Oh , I tried to make a joke involving people dying and equines but God was all " that happened once " .
I see
Not always !
Well most cars have one horn that only makes one tone , right ? So the only paths for sentiment encoding are honk duration and count . Maybe one honk from that guy means " Hey sexy ! ! " and two short honks means " Wait a minute ! You're not so sexy ! ! "
Still looking for a friend whose special skill is inventing and then giving away time machines , diary .
Always an option , my friend !
I CALL IT " PRESS X TO EAT A PIE "
I've seen you eat fruits and vegetables !

In his spare time , he also wrote plays !
Punished ? No . REWARDED . With a tantalizing glimpse of a story path you are not yet meant to behold !
Oh wow ! Really ?
THEY ARE GOING TO PICK HER UP A PRESENT FOR HER BIRTHDAY . THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET HER A VEGETABLE STEAMER BECAUSE SHE'S MENTIONED HOW SHE COULD USE ONE , BUT NOT THEY BOTH WANT TO GET SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL . YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING DOWN .
So we're cheering up a random woman at some expense , but at the end , we'll probably all get to eat chicken wings together . Alright , I'm in ! Let's do it !
SEE ? WHAT DID I TELL YOU
. . . for some reason !
{ { sad face } } Groggy
Well if everything is viewed as a business arrangement between traders without charity , then how can you have love ? Love is selfless .
What's the DEAL ?
Now compare and contrast : Dromiceiomimus , you've got a very pretty body ! I like that in a woman .
What about an encyclopaedia ?
HAVE YOU PAID YOUR HEATING BILLS T - REX
Please ! It's not like I invented this little trick !
Great ! Great ! How do I look ?
BUT SOON , HILARIOUS CONSEQUENCES !
No , like we both get tattoos at the same time - for moral support . Twin tattoos ? You were thinking we'd each get separate halves of the yin yang symbol or something ?
So Hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms ; I believe this was a matter of some investment . But build it he did , and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up , with each of them wanting a room ! Lucky for Hilbert he had his infinite hotel , so each guest got a room , and the hotel was filled up to capacity . Nice ! But just then another friggin' bus showed up , and it ALSO had infinity people in it !
God , again !
This is what I'm saying !
This allows us to fashion an empirical and verifiable understanding of the world around us . Theories are said to be correct if they match up with the observed properties of the universe ! However , science makes the tacit assumption that the universe is predictable and orderly and regular , which MAY NOT BE THE CASE .
I think we're really privileged , yeah , and I think it's a pretty terrible image that while there are places where clean drinking water is a luxury if it's available at all , we are literally pooping in it .
Hey , I heard you were pissed off !
People will fall for this for sure !
I think I'd be really good at writing comedy ! And I also think I'd be great at writing horror and EROTICAL FICTION / BIOGRAPHY .
Aww , what a nice story !
And it's all thanks to legal loopholes !
That IS one way of looking at it !
Alright everyone ! We've had a good run , but it's time to face facts :
I'll say it again : if I had one wish , it'd be " Tell me how long it's going to take until everyone realizes they should never argue with me about Back to the Future " .
I love punch ! I love drinking delicious punch , PROBABLY because of how it's so delicious !
I don't know ! Maybe !
That's me !

It means " crazy " !
I HAD PLANS TODAY , FOR YOUR INFORMATION
Like , one , I guess .
I suspect that these are all bad puns !
One ! Folks who snap up expired domain names and fill them with porn !
Pfft , these people are broken and I don't wanna deal with their garbage . Hey , you know the difference between a world where nobody's sexist and a world where everyone just PRETENDS not to be sexist ? ?
I wonder what it was like ? Maybe I was really good !
Yeah , I figured maybe pals are in this season ? But if both those covers fail I've got Fallback Plan Omega , which involves 100 % GUARANTEED sales .

Our population consisting exclusively of pygmy wild animals is in danger of becoming unsustainable . Therefore I must impose a tax based inversely on weight . The heavier an animal , the less the tax .

BASICALLY , after September 11th , our guy decides that he's had enough of just punching dudes and joins the fire department . He becomes real and now he punches out fires . He punches kittens out of trees . He punches people who get trapped in cars when they drive off the road .
I mean , that makes sense .
Batman doesn't have " nappy times " ! !

Ah , yes !
Yes , the weather has been very nice lately .
Diagnosis as therapy ?

Have a passive breathing system that supports respiration without actively moving air around .
Carl Saga said it , and we respect a man who has such a deep , fundamentalist understanding of " from scratch " ! So we'll be devoting our time to studying protouniversal dynamics in the hopes of creating a small , stable , personal universe in which apple trees might eventually be induced to grow .
And a plane with shark teeth painted on the front !

If you're unfamiliar with them , Dromiceiomimus , number stations are radio stations that play pre - recorded voices reciting long strings of numbers , often with a short musical cue beginning or ending the segments .

I see now that I've been petty and unfair and all I really wanted was to have a little of your attention . Can you ever forgive me and let me admire you from a distance ?
Why yes , as a matter of fact I -
That's pretty weak .

Not enough things glow in the dark , AND , the things that glow in the dark don't glow in the dark for long enough . Even if I had a glow - in - the - dark skull it would only glow for like , two minutes . That is only two kinds of spooky : spookily sucky and spookily DISAPPOINTING .

Okay , first get a computer . Then , program that computer to take text as input and use semantic analysis to figure out the topic of that text . Then , use a synset database to find related words connected to that topic . Finally , replace any words in the text that have synonyms in your sysnset ! So a text about bikes would replace " 'I like bikes ! ' said Rob " with " 'I like bikes ! ' SPOKE Rob " .

Aww , Morris , that's nothing you have to worry about now !
They were so vile . I literally could not understand it .
Keep on swimmin' , ladies , because I love you both super equally !
Don't even mess with " bigger line height " or that other amateur - hour garbage . Do it like the pros do : by copying and pasting your first few pages into the middle , prefaced by " For those of you just joining us , " and concluded by , " And now , the conclusion . . . " .
How do you do it ?
Yes , well - I realize that now , Utahraptor , and it makes me very Sad !
So now you're saying you regret your statue ? Man ! I'd like to know what your statue thinks about all this !
BEGGING THE QUESTION
Utahraptor , these are PILLS . These are meds you buy at a pharmacy . It made my problem WORSE when someone WHO WORKS IN MEDICINE couldn't bring themselves to say , " Okay . These make the poops come out " . " Promotes regularity " ? What the hell is that ? ALL SORTS OF IRREGULARITY CAN HAPPEN DOWN THERE . I've seen it !
Dromiceiomimus , let's do something tonight ! Something awesome !
YOU THINK ABOUT TIME TRAVEL CONSTANTLY
I'm excited that I can write down all my secrets and stuff them into a box at the bank , and I really don't know why you guys are having so much trouble getting on board with this . SECRETS in a box .
That's exactly it : I never surprise myself ! When will I do crazy things ? When will I wake up in jail and laugh ?
THIS PROBLEM IS NOW SOLVED FOREVER
Possibly ! Or , I could be prepared and we could have a great time without you .
What happens tomorrow is based on what happens today .
However , I don't claim to be a misogynist ! It is a problem that the very tall face when confronted with the very tiny . Sometimes you step on them by accident !

Maybe we think they're gross because they're bad to eat ?
Man ! History is the " um actually " of academic disciplines .
I like dogs !
That's for us to realize that war sucks ( it makes us die too ) , and so to give up a little of our freedom in exchange for an ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY who will ensure internal peace and common defence . Tada !
It is something I am experimenting with
I can't wait !
This is great ! I can't be held responsible for my actions !
A retraction !
Okay ! Tell me . . . oh , I don't know . . .
You know what happens in movies that doesn't happen NEARLY enough to me , here in reality which I have reluctantly concluded is not actually a movie ?
Yes indeed . I'm experimenting with it .

And then we send over food ! Nachos ! Fries ! CHICKEN WINGS .

Whoah , T - Rex ! What the heck are you doing , making jokes about sexual predators ?
Hah hah ! What's the matter monocle guy ? You don't like being boxed by a kangaroo ? ?
BUT LATER , ALL IS FORGOTTEN :
A steel worker lumberjack , skin shiny with sweat and mucus , wastin' food with one hand and high fiving three woman at once with the other !
Oooh , what scary costumes !
Where the hell is he ? !
You've got a pretty high opinion of your wit , T - Rex !

Wait - by which standards are we measuring detective senses ?

Even a program that emulates your brain perfectly is in pi : if it can be represented as numbers , it's there ! And this means we can use pi as a DATA TRANSMISSION DEVICE : all I need to send you the start digit and end digit , and the numbers between are my message ! Kapow !

STUPID DUMB ADVERTISING SLOGAN TECHNIQUES
BINGO .
Frig !
I know that !
T - REX , HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS ?
Yeah , it's great how you can see things like you're really there ! But it's also super constrained and sad , for the world is hollow and walls surround you perfectly . There's no escape , and even when you're " outside " there's nothing underground , nothing over the mountains , and if you swim too far you hit an invisible wall or you DIE . It's a tiny world and you're the only one alive in it . Hey , why don't you kill that monster . It's something to do .
Robin Hod , Count Dracula , Frankenstein's Monster were all in a room . " I vant to remind everyone that ve are all out of copyright ! " said Dracula ! He used the Dracula voice . You know the one ?
Anyway ! With this in mind , I am going to become totally racist ! !
Guys ! ! I'll take the most popular title and write that book !
But often , when science is reported , equal credence is given to the kooks and their kooky theories ! Science is presented as merely an opposing viewpoint .
Like a calorie - counting app , but instead it tells you how long ANYTHING takes to kill you !
I don't have a solution for this , I just wanted to give fair warning : y'all be typing out butts .
Dude I think you took too much
Are we on time for this revelation ?
There are tons of stupid dumb advertising slogan techniques Oh my goodness , they're so terrible . Let's consider a few such as . . .
" One day a couple was having sex but their car window was broken . The man thought a kid broke it . Instead of sex they wondered how it happened . I , the narrator , was the one who did it ! They never found out , and I won the lottery ! The end ! ! "
This is entirely reasonable !
The islanders started mimicking what they'd seen the troops doing !
NEXT : HIJINKS
Oh , I only smoke once in a while , and only when I've been drinking .
Dromiceiomimus ! Give me a challenge !

Attention , friends ! I have changed my name to . . . " THE DOG " !
. . . others feel it places an unnecessary strain on our already - burdened hospitals and health care system !
All you're doing is talking about delicious punch . Why not just go get some ?
Consciousness : pretty okay !
But it occurs to me there are situations where ignorance is bliss ! For example , imagine if you knew all about how the worst moment of your life would go down . You'd spend a bunch of your time saying " Aw dang , that's STILL going to suck ! "
I know tons of secrets about other professions anyway ! Dromiceiomimus , did you know that restaurants want you to fill up on bread ?
TO BE HONEST
That is technically true , cannibals !
Three PROFESSION MEMBERS drive off a cliff . What's the tragedy ?
But check it out , Dromiceiomimus : we hear sound mechanically ( sound waves hitting a membrane ) which , IT TURNS OUT , only takes a couple of milliseconds to be understood by the brain ! But our retinas react to light through a longer chemical process AND their information is more complicated to process , so it can take upwards of 50 milliseconds before the brain has it in a usable form .
IN A SONG !
No , I'm just saying that we're actually pretty bad at random number generation and if you ask folks to pick a number in a range , some choices will show up more often than others . It's not THAT unlikely you'd both land on the same number !
Unlikely !

I want to make this dream come true , Drotimes ! Fortune cookies have for DECADES been offering restrained , generic , feel - good advice which sets me up AMAZINGLY WELL for cookies that offer terrifyingly specific and urgent advice .

No , no , T - Rex , no !
Argh ! Never try to have a theological discussion with God !
God ! POSSIBLY . And the problem is , um , equivalent to the P = NP problem .
AT THE " STORY OFF " :
How come nobody has ever sent me a telegram ? Telegrams are old - skool classiness given physical form !
MAN , I already know I got born . I even have the date !
Okay , but I warn you : it is unfinished .

Good luck representing that in a way that guys don't find inherently confusing !

And before you ask what happened , Dromiceiomimus , I'll assure you I was simply being ultra manly , and then I was being TOO manly , and then I fell down the stairs .
I hereby claim the unclaimed parts of Antarctica in the name of me , Dromiceiomimus !
. . . I think your voice is a wonderful gift !
If I'm going to be verificationist , I'd better figure out what it means to say that something is true ! I'm going to start with . . . relativism !
It's like always - on slow - motion Play - Doh Fun Factories , ALL OVER THEIR BODIES .
Really !
No , man !
Second place is first loser , T - Rex .
He's a Transformer , but he's also biologically human ! So he has to deal with THEMES associated with either being a man , or being a soft , warm , fleshy and hairy semi truck filled with blood intestines and lungs .
Let's assume that if we're simulating universes , we're doing it for a reason . Sure , SOME simulations would be the whole universe , but that's complicated and expensive ! Why simulate boring microbes galaxies away if we're just interested in one dude on Earth ? And why simulate this one dude at all , unless you're trying to find out more about his life , get inside his head , perhaps . . . FIND OUT WHERE HE BURIED THE DIAMONDS ? ?
I for one would like to register disappointment with every aspect of the future ?
I GET IT ALL BABY
Pull yourself together , Shakespeare !
First : snake oil salesmen !
But what if I like novels where you just read WORD after WORD after WORD for hundreds of pages straight ?
American Thanksgiving is similar , but distinct , from regular Thanksgiving .
Sleepwalkers can have their EYES OPEN and you can talk to them , but they're confused . Take away that confusion and I'd be unstoppable ! I'd be TAKING CARE OF BIDNESS while everyone else was dreaming about SOCKS .
T - REX I CAN PRACTICALLY SEE THE THOUGHT BALLOON ABOVE YOUR HEAD
. . . I think it's broken !
5 . ) FREE COMICS CONVENTION
Nothing ! I don't have any secrets !
But T - Rex , you really got my hopes up !
LET'S WATCH !
Utahraptor ! !
A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHARLES BABBAGE AND HIS WONDERFUL CALCULATING ENGINES COMICS
The PROBLEM with democracy is that it relies on the wisdom of crowds - " mobs " , if you will - and it's like , is that the best we can do ? When it's time to make a decision , we'll ask a bunch of strangers what they think and then we all convince ourselves that the most popular opinion is always the correct one ? ?
Someone going by the all - caps name " ZACH MORRIS " has tagged my house ! My front door is now spraypainted with " Zach " 's stupid name for jerks . I don't even like Saved by the Bell that much !
You already had this realization , T - rex !
This is where my story ends
Well if it IS , then it's self - describing , which means autological . And if it ISN'T , then it's autological again too . Huh . If this paradox is supposed to make me trip balls , you should know I've taken the precaution of having them TIGHTLY SECURED .
Pretty sweet deal , my friends !
Thank you all for coming . By now you are familiar with the " Frosty " snow golem and his rampage here and there , all around the square .
I'm off to construct private prisons in Africa on my own dime , giving me access to cheap forced labour ! Then I'll sell the product of this labour at hugely inflated prices , thanks to a near monopoly I've constructed . I'll also use decades of ads to convince the public that this item is absolutely necessary to express true love .
Dear audio diary ! !
With your knowledge , you can never again stomp the humans !
Darn it !
Research ? That is ARTS and / or CRAFTS .
Are you sure ? It's pretty . . . biological .
PEACE OUT FOREVER , I SUPPOSE ? ?
CORRECT .
Oh my god . Forget I said anything .
He ate vegetables and shot feral goats , left behind from earlier voyages !
Ah yes , a new move , a new house ! A new beginning , another chance to -
Yes , but maybe our OLD LADY GRANDPARENTS were the ones big into prepositions . Today's youth cares about more dynamic , exciting things !
I KNOW .
" Why are we here ? " " What is our purpose ? " - that sort of thing !
I guess I'm lucky ! I can't imagine what it must be like to be trans - sexual , waking up in the morning and feeling like there's been some unfair mistake , and parts of your body are WRONG .
Maybe you can tell me what your previous passwords were , and get satisfaction that way !
There sure are a lot of songs about dancing ! I have probably heard at LEAST three hundred songs about dancing .
That's all I had to say , I think I'm going back to bed now
No , YOU the man !
So to fix his problem , he invented a new rifle that shot ghosts !
A " loaded question " is when you ask a question that presupposes something unproven !
OH MAN I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE
Well ! I certainly hope you'll change your mind for VAMPIRE DAY next week . I'm DEFINITELY not forgetting my cape for that !
I remember watching as someone went from respecting me to thinking I'm a liar : worse , a liar who does it for no reason .
That assumes a completely deterministic universe . What about free will ?
Congratulations , Dromiceiomimus !
I sure can !
Utahraptors ! Did you know : SACRIFICE IS A PART OF FRIENDSHIP ? ?
- Toast !
Whales do it , dude !
I can totally make up some inventions . Rubber bands shaped like Justin Bieber ! DONE .
Hey , T - Rex , can I borrow - oh God ! What happened ? !
Yeah , only catchier and more informative !
A red dwarf star in SECRET ORBIT around OUR OWN SUN . Every 27 million years it returns , disturbs comets in the Oort cloud , and death rains down from the skies . All life on our planet , eternally cursed by a single wayward star .
WELL BACK IT UP
Maybe I will , Utahraptor ! MAYBE I'LL ENJOY POOPING MY PANTS EACH AND EVERY DAY ! !
We've made robot clones you can hug !
And if you don't like what Wikipedia says , you can change it ! But then some random stranger will change it back with a snippy " citation needed for 'dogs = mega ultrarad' " , and you're like , have you ever SEEN dogs ? Have you EVEN EVER SEEN A DOG . Because you obviously haven't or you'd know precisely how ultrarad they are , which is : mega . They are mega ultrarad and PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW .
Something people like to argue about sometimes is whether or not certain things are genetically innate , or personal decisions !
When I feel intrigued , I have to say " How intriguing ! " or " Guys , I'm really intrigued right now " because I can't express it through my face . Watch ! Say something intriguing .
Dead .
Yo've just based TV shows on common sayings !
And that's really interesting actually but we've got bigger concerns !
WE ALL KNOW HIS DEAL . He's a heroic guy who saves princesses . He's universally known for how good he is at running , jumping , and PARTICULARLY at tanooki cosplay . And yet , watch someone play his game , and you'll see the reality of Mario : he's a guy who - IN THE SPACE OF FIVE SECONDS - will accidentally knock a turtle shell into himself , get injured , mistime a jump , fall into a pit , and DIE .
It was the CRAZIEST !
Oh ! And a nice body .
Why are we using artful euphamisms [ sic ] on MEDICINE PACKAGING ?
Even today , millions of lost souls - already under the influence of music - decide to dedicate their lives towards producing more of it .
The ship sank only a few miles from shore , didn't she ?
THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF THINGS
Insane !
An evil mastermind is planning to smash meteors into the planet ! !
But all for naught !
Sex with a partner can be pretty neat though !
But come on ! You have to admit that we're the superi -
Yaaaaay ! !
Try " Anus sore was wrecked ! "
I'll just be late , that's all ! Late with my PILLOWCASE FULL OF CANDY .
The person who falls for this probably won't even realize they've had a prank pulled on them ! And when they do , there's no moment of laughing realization , just irritation .
Oh , we're just getting started !
T - REX , YOU -
POLITICS , huh ?
The point is that dieting is about commiserating , and I'm the guy who shows up to the party saying " guys , it's not hard " and that my secret to weight - loss success is " um , eating less . "
I really thought I wrote that one better . Wow .
First , create an account . Tumblr will ask you to name your " blog " . Cool blogs have cool names like " Pics o' Dogs " , " OMG . . . Dog Pix ? ! " or " LOL , Just Dog Pix I Guess " . Dumb blogs have names like " Breaking World News Conveyed Entirely Through Reaction Gifs "
" HOW TO LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE "
Yeah you do ! The bear with the punch . . . that punched other punches !
We're getting closer to computers that can choose their own words , and this shows how sensitive these choices can be !
I forgot about that ! !
You have not !
How slight a difference are we talking about here ?
My fears have been reduced by precisely 80 % !
I am comforted by the fact that a type of immortality may still be possible . I speak of course of immortality through art !
Jerk it to the change you want to see in the world , Dromiceiomimus ! !
Welp , I guess childhood continues unabated for me !
T - REX'S BIG TATTOO
Ah . So if you're someone from three years ago , shouldn't you be dressing up for Hallowe'en ? Hallowe'en 2005 ?
" THE TALENT SHOW "
I disagree ! ! It sounded like you were about to say " cookie equity " .
I was your teachah !
No wonder nobody likes me !
TOUCH - o - vision !
Secondly , I , um , don't like it when my theories are proven wrong
That's a great way of looking at it ! I'm a cyborg and the internet is part of my GIANT BRAIN !
and all panels are identical !
Huh ! People know the riddle of the Sphinx ?
Oh my god , YES .
Yeah , but A SEX celebrity ! It stinks !
THERE . THERE WAS A GOOD TIME TO USE IT .
Oh snap ! Sick burns on my beats , God !
. . . SEXUAL predator ? ?
Perhaps not !
I am ! It seems I get into trouble five times a week - but luckily , I've got some great pals to help me out !
He told you about that ?
Maaaan !
And the other guy doesn't ?
The world will end on May 21st or whatever ! !
Well - it's hard to remove the " human factor " from any evaluation like this .
I . . . !
No regrets I guess
What ? ! You just came out ahead on a one in a hundred thousand million chance , and you want a PRIZE ? Isn't it enough to spit in the face of PROBABILITY HERSELF ? ?
Is there any reason why you're being such a DWEEB - O - RAMA ?
Yeah , hold on , that one's a little ridic . Bruce can't breathe underwater .
THE " HEY DID YOU SEE THAT MOVIE " APPROACH :
Let's pay her a visit and find out !
Dear Lord !
MACBETH .
Heck , I know I would be .
THE WORKS
Sounds good to me !
" It's okay , sweetie ! I'm sure one day you'll find someone ALMOST as good as me ! "
Well , you ARE using the wrong words . I counted three .
Then , when we were outside , I suddenly knew shame for the first time . . . and my crush did too ! I swear I never blushed so much in my enitre life !
Let's answer that question with terrible , hard - earned experience !
And they're all turning out rad !
Nope , just regular sexism !
I must ?
Aw gross ! That dude across the street is thinking about poo .
I'm - I'm not sure I understand ?
You can watch me !
Ah , that's totally salty !
Today is a good day I think for talking about ex - girlfriends !
Most everyone else gets through life without being terrified of death , T - Rex , and some even look death in the face every day ! You should talk to stunt drivers , or like , bear aggravators . You could learn from them !
No matter what you do , there's always something more you could have done , and more you could have achieved ?
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX ACTUALLY IS THE BEST AT TABLEAU :
i'm working on macbeth OKAY T - REX
Hells yeah !
mm ! strawberry , my favourite !
" You call your employees geniuses , " Tim said , flatly .
Didn't the grocery store have a parking lot , Morris ?
The word , my friend , is " batman " . THE WORD " BATMAN " ITSELF COMES FROM HORSES .
WHY INDEED ? !
Or PERHAPS we're not trying hard enough ! Let's work extra hard for a bit .
Today is a good day I think for surprising my friends . . .
Ouch . Utahraptor , I promise I'll say it even if you die with tons of fully realized potential !
But what to do . . .
NOT ANYMORE !
As you can see , he denies the fact of his death and walks the earth , a restless spirit , unable to pass into the next realm .
HOW TO GET MARRIED
Maybe I do , actually ! What's this about ?
English is a pretty good language !
This is not the first time in my life I've had incident to shout this ! !
Guys , I totally know ! !
That was beautiful !
I always assumed so , but I actually never tested it ! Maybe a GHOST is the answer to The Case of Who Ate My Sandwhich , I Left It Right Here ? ?
Incurring the wrath of god comix !
I have kissed a lady . I have seen PLENTY of beautiful sunsets . I've even driven a car through a fruit stand during a car chase !
HALLOWE'EN FOR PARENTS
How -
Man . Lot of assumptions we're making here just to get you out of putting your wet laundry in the dryer .
We imagine stuff and we watch television and we pay to see movies and basically , all we're running around spending a non - trivial chunk of our lives - of EACH AND EVERY DAY - imagining things and events and situations that don't exist .
These things DON'T EXIST .
If you have been affected by this issue , a BodyPartz professional can physically scrape bacteria off your TeethBits with a metal spike . There is a small charge for this service .
I guess it's settled then !
Look at me , I'm complaining about the present by comparing it to how things were back in my day ! I'm stereotypically OLD , Utahraptor .
Since she's an Indian dinosaur , she cant help but have anything she eats become Indian food !
I GUESS WE MET SOMEWHERE ONCE ?
True enough !
" , he said .
THAT IS LITERALLY ALL AUTHORS DO .
Not being a T - Rex
That was a joke ! Hot babes ? Hell ? Hot ? Hell is hot ?
OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS NEVER BEEN SO ENDANGERED
Look man , maybe there's been research , I dunno . I don't exactly " read " linguistic papers .
Certainly no SOCIOPATHIC reason , Utahraptor .
Dude , even if you DO buy one of everything on the planet and write your name on it -
Eugh .
Summon all females to castle North !
OR MAYBE the answer is you get a ghost to show them your dystopian vision of their future ! Do you know any ghosts ?
RAGE THAT I LIVE IN A WORLD THAT'S TOO SMALL FOR MY AWESOME GIANT BODY .
EXACTLY !
Sherlock Holmes turns back to his writing table , still roaring . " I'll write a story where Sherlock Holmes investigates a dog that glows ! " he bellows . " That's already been done by the original author " hollers Watson .
" Hey UNSherlock BLOWmes , " laughed Moriarty . " Shut up , " said Sherlock , but Moriarty didn't . " Shut up , " said T - Rex , and Moriarty DID ! There was something about T - Rex's strange citrine eyes that made him afraid - and intrigued .
a comic to solve all your emotional problems
That's my compliment ?
And booze , yeah !
Well , then I guess I'm creepy , because I totally did those things . I stole a glass because someone I'd seen on TV touched it . I didn't know I was that sort of creeper , Utahraptor , but here we are .
We could go to the water lake beach shore in our water lake beach shore swimming shorts for swimming ? In water ?
T - REX THE MAUSOLEUM AND HANGING GARDENS AND COLOSSUS AND LIGHTHOUSE WERE ALL DESTROYED BY EARTHQUAKES LEAVING THE STATUE OF ZEUS TO BURN DOWN AND THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA TO UM CONTINUE TO HANG AROUND
I hope so !
So , you want to sound like Cary Grant , eh ?
And yet , not really , when you compare it to , say , murderin' dudes .
Well , relationships are all about a shared history , right ? If that's forgotten , all that's left is a stranger .
I'm terrified of DYING . Totally different .
Hah ! Absolutely not !
Wow , that was a really interesting premise you had for a moment there !
* cough *
Yep ! But only if you don't sto -
So why'd you stop ?
I'm afraid that I must respectfully disagree ! !
Dromiceiomimus , you are one such super friend ! I can see us getting together years from now , after we all drift apart , and still being able to pick up from where we left off . We'd email once or twice a year and that would be all it would take to maintain our super friendship .
MAYBE it's time for us to start from scratch and DESIGN a better language ? A language without any problems , a language where everything is logical , predictable , culturally - neutral and so easy to learn that we all basically already know it ?
Where there is lexical or syntactic ambiguity , you could argue that you are free to choose a preferred meaning - granted - but you cannot arbitrarily transform someone's words into what you want ! That process undermines the very foundation of language , as words are robbed of any fixed meaning , rendering communication arbitrary and pointless !
But there were a few survivors : people in planes and and those on beaches , where the land / water inversion had a minimal effect . Most , however , suddenly found themselves under miles of water while those in boats found themselves freefalling towards what had previously been the ocean floor !
That's funny , because I smell fine !
Also homeostasis , a higher anabolism rate than their catabolism rate , and the abilities to change over time in response to their environment and to respond to stimuli , usually through motion !
Instead , fall back to your second choices , such as @ abirdpoopedonme , @ pooponmyhead , or @ ohitouchedapoop .
That last one sounds pretty awesome !
WHAT IF T - REX WERE A CHICK COMICS
DROMICEIOMIMUS HAS GONE MISSING ! LET'S FIND HER
( superfulous panel A )
I was accusing him of the whole " ironic punishment " Greek God thing . But he's not so bad ! I give him a hard time sometimes .
I'm old enough to drink !
Even if that's true , it's never good to hear that bad a line . Instead , they should say " I've gotta stop by the bank real quick to make a deposit . . . OF MURDER " .
Thanks man !
You're saying if there was a guy who could produce utopia , you'd want him in charge .
TO DAMN LONG
Awesome things , natch !
" Furthermore , I can deduce from your stupid shirt that you're a big jerk who sucks " , Sherlock continues . Aaron was this guy who always insulted me , the author , in grade three . In real life , I mean ! I spent a long time thinking of how I could get back at him , then one day I overheard someone else say " back to you " when THEY got insulted , and it seemed to be an unstoppable retort ! I WAS FINALLY READY .
Ooh !
Guys , debt is nothing more than memory !
Stood up on Valentine's day ?
Every time he ate a fly he would say " Oh , this tastes gross . I would much prefer a nice hamburger and soda . " Every time he slept on a lily pad he'd say " Oh , this is cold and wet . I would much prefer a nice bed . " Every time he'd go on a date he'd say " Oh , this is just a regular ol' frog ! I would much prefer someone who can carry a nice conversation or read a book . "
But did you know that biking without a helmet can be dangerous ? Actually biking with a helmet can be dangerous too . Biking , regardless of helmet status , can be dangerous .
OH MY GOD , THAT REMINDS ME OF A MONTH AGO ! ! LIKE IF YOU AGREE !
Sometimes you can order meat sandwiches from inside your car at Burger King
Oh yeah ? Well if you're going as a Utahraptor , then I'm going as a T - Rex !
LISTEN T - REX
Ok , some other time !
So they're shaped like naughty bits ?
Who does that ?
I'm never more than a week away from death ! Worse than that : I'm never more than a friggin' WORK week away from death ! Baloney !
A BIT LATER
Everyone ! If I was called T - Tex I could wear big Texas hat all the time ! !
Okay . Everyone , pick a number between one and ten !
YOU ARE SPECIAL
Leave me alone you crazy bastard !
Looks like !
Hello , Utah - raptor !
Um - that , ah , wasn't me .
Listen attentively to people's names when you meet them ! If their name is the same as yours , laugh !
MORE DOWNSIDES TO IMMORTALITY
NO REGRETS ! !
If there's THREE things I've got , it's confidence , burgers , and the mantra that " As bad as today gets , soon my stomach will be brimming with beef . "
I did a search for " Lady Gaga " and it turns out we maintain a Lady Gaga webpage in memoriam of every single from 4000 BC Earth . Sorry , no , that's not right . We maintain SEVENTEEN OF THEM .
I take it back I take it back ! !
" I wish the new Star Trek movie didn't establish you can beam to Qo'noS , because starships are now superfluous . "
KYAAH !
Why am I here ?
We take that and multiply it by the chance of someone becoming an Olympic athlete !
Man ! They are molded chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone . Am I now to apologize for BRILLIANCE ?
I don't get it !
I have a friendship crush on all my friends . They're great !
It sounds like you've got allergies , T - Rex !
aw , that probably just means i've messed up somewhere again . the problem is that i'm not real good at biting people , you know ? and biting people is all zombies do ! i didn't know , but being a zombie is an awful hassle
THIS WAS HOW IT BEGAN . Soon the whole world discovers that dreams have become consistent across everyone - as near as we can tell , even our DOGS are entering the same shared dreamspace ! Communication becomes free , as long as both of you are sleeping , and the world changes , literally overnight .
Man , how would you feel if someone said that to you ?
Thanks to Rufus' excellent time - travelling telephone booth , we can travel to any time period ! Thus , Ted and I are gathering some ancient history dudes so that we don't fail on our MOST BOGUS history report !
How am I to advise this friend - should he break it off ? Should he let the woman make her own decisions ?
Do you have a concussion , T - Rex ? Should you go to the hospital ?
Um , no ! It's science fiction DRAMA . " Louie Louie " is just a really good song .
Well - it just doesn't seem very charitable , that's all . Plus , if you need a list to remember your enemies , maybe it's better if you just forgave and forgot ?
HIDDEN TALENTS
Yeah , but I was never going to .
MAGGIE MAY
For profits !
I will be pleased to seduce you after introductions have been made !
Right , Dromiceiomimus ? I'm a good poet , right ?
I'll be that guy !
I'M not certain anyone has tried !
Well , it might as well be , since it's all we've got .
OKAY T - REX
And if you are a man - OR a woman , Dromiceiomimus ! - who shares my love for tasty barbecued meat , then you should come over tonight and we'll have a barbecue !
I mean , I'm making the jokes in good spirit , and some of my best friends are wee and OH MY GOSH that's something a size - racist would say isn't it ? ?
From no on , I'm doing what I feel like , when I feel like doing it !
My characters kiss on each other , like , ALL the time
I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PLAYING A GAME IN WHICH ONE CONTROLS A ROBOT LOADED WITH FUTURISTIC WEAPONRY
Let's do them every year until we die , okay ?
That's not what they meant !
No , I think that movie's been referenced enough lately
Also , this pet will have to be cuter than I am , thereby making me look even tougher in comparison !
Well - it's a fine line ! I'm not asexual myself , so there's a distance between myself and the material . But I am trying .
Hey , Utahraptor , if your house was on fire , what one possession would you want to save ?
And my size ?
Wait a minute , that brain one is ambiguous ! Do you mean my brain might NOT stop functioning , or that it might CONTINUE to function in an undiagnosable way ?
No . He shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it , though !
You're not going to correct them ?
Man , y'all be hard to impress !
I was asked for money on the street today , and after I gave what change I had , I was told quite aggressively by the guy that it wasn't enough ! This can only mean that it's time once again to discuss everyone's favourite topic . . .
And THIS rule fixes the thing where folks expect forgiveness , so they act like it's guaranteed . Because even if you trip me on purpose , knowing that I'm not gonna hold it against you for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE , that doesn't mean you should do it anyway !
Man , YOU owe ME 12 dollars ! We were at the grocery store and you REALLY wanted to get those stupid fish sticks shaped like Jane Austen , remember ?
GREETINGS T - REX WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM
But THEN worst case they'll think , " Wait , nevermind : THIS dude just had supremely excellent taste ! ! "
THE PERFECT WOMAN
For my first trick , I will make an entire house disappear !
I feel certain the opportunity will present itself .
Every book is written by SOMEONE , right ? My point is that the SYSTEM - the MAN - is set up so that anyone who doesn't want to be an author can't write a book . Ergo , racism ahoy .
Why you gotta have a word like " old maid " , chock full of negative connotations for unmarried adult women , but there's no equivalently - negative term for unmarried adult men ?
It's okay . Some of us were born wrong , some achieve wrongness , and some have wrongness thrust upon 'em . You are maybe all three ?
Dromiceiomimus ! Here's a crazy question . Would you say that YOU are a triflin' friend indeed ?
Man , I messed it up ! I need to make " short " puns and I made a " long " pun instead . That's the opposite of short , and it's not even the opposite of the same SENSE of short ! I mean short in the " tiny " sense , not in the " as opposed to long " sense .
I forgot about my dentist's appointment !
You put me on the spot !
I propose a new law : that folks cannot be held responsible for what they do while they're sleeping !
I REPLACED IT WITH SOME STICKS OF DISCOUNT PEPPERONI
Before we broke up , I mean ! !
Hey , is this woman bothering you , Utahraptor ?
Vows are meant to be saved for the big things , man !
Okay , you can lay on the crackers again a little .
Hah ! Looks like you'd better be EXTRA nice to us then !
BUT A FEW EVENINGS LATER T - REX DOES THE EXACT SAME THING !
Are you doing that ? !
Aaaand here's why !
Utahraptor , it's you ! You're back from the alternate universe ! But . . . something's different . . .
The war with the reanimated spaceship crew was disastrous !
Though , I think , not as much as I would have liked it to . Sometimes I feel like I cling to my small - town origins as a substitute for a real identity .
And then they hit the asteroid and sink , or I guess explosively decompress or whatever ?
And did he ?
But my plan was to educate ! When people called me on " niggardly " , I was going to explain how it most likely derives from the Scandinavian " nig " ( miserly ) , and in fact pre - dates any similar racially - charged words by hundreds of years !
If the Titanic had hit the iceberg head - on , damage would have been limited to the comparatively strong bow of the ship , and only a few compartments would have been flooded . Some would've been hurt and maybe even killed -
Oh wow , perfect !
Yeah man !
That's right ! I'm questioning the very IDEA of an " indoor voice " ! The revolution begins here !
Make it something sexual , T - Rex !
That does seem more practical !
TODAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE TODAY IS THE DAY I ACHIEVE 10 BILLION POINTS IN THE ARCADE VERSION OF " NIBBLER " WHICH YOU WILL NOTE IS A FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BEFORE
SUDDENLY ! !
LATER : HOLLYWOOD !
Good news , Utahraptor ! It's not too late for me to throw away my story and plagiarize yours ! !
It will not .
Writers , did you imagine horned - up people " by accident " again ? ?
Aw man , do those exist ?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU
Okay , okay , I can do this . There was a time . . . of which . . . upon . . .
Peer pressuring your way though mental problems ?
Okay T - Rex : what would you say if . . . YOUR COMPUTER'S FILE SYSTEM GOT CORRUPTED ?
" Oh boy , I see in the distance a villag - CITY that I can destroy ! "
NEVER HAS A FRACTION OF A PERCENT BEEN MORE IMPORTANT
And did his vision get worse ?
Man , it SELLS ITSELF ! I , hugga bubba , don't understand why you're fighting this .
Hey , I had a dream about you last night , only you had my mother's body , and , um -
The sheep put on snorkel gear ; it is PROBABLY the most adorable ?
T - Rex , inside your " bod " is a tube of WARM POOP , just sitting there in your belly , carried around with you everywhere . And every day you try excreting it , but it's pointless because you can never get it all out , and more's growing inside you constantly .
DO NOT BOTHER ANSWERING THAT QUESTION FOR THERE EXISTS NO ANSWER THAT CAN GIVE ANY SATISFACTION
Okay , she's a woman . She is hot because of her , I dunno , hair . She's a mammal now too . She wants to be a movie star , but right now she lives on a stupid farm .
So what'd he do ?
Maybe they're a new form of life - a new species - and they have a leftover aversion to cannibalism ?
T - REX SOME PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES GRAPPLING WITH A DEVIL THEY CAN'T SEE BUT WHOSE INFLUENCE THEY PERCEIVE
For instance : these smart machines could make even smarter machines !
NO MORAL
Oh ! We'll also need butts ! !
Ladies ! Gentlemen ! Everybody stop what you're doing for a sec .
LET'S STEAL SOMETHING ELSE
Good , good ! Now flesh out the world and add some supporting characters . Show us WHY she wants to have the sexy times !
Jake ! Your sudden appearance coupled with your hilarious one - liner has made me forget all your previous slights against me !
so it's ending now , right ?
Utahraptor , come quick ! !
TUESDAY :
T - REX I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING SO I'M JUST GONNA ANSWER YOUR MOST RECENT QUESTION
Fake graves . . . for EVERYONE !
Yaaaay !
Honestly , doesn't that sound like a better book ? You get all the drama of Hamlet , PLUS now it's more fun to read ! Authors make me imagine what THEY want , and all I'm asking in return is that everyone in the story WITHOUT EXCEPTION be rockin' tight bods .
Well then !
Look at that house ! Incredible !
WHY ARE POLTERGEISTS SUCH JERKS ? ?
Lady Gaga analogizes sex to poker ! In the song , I mean !
Thanks , John Computers ! Way to invent machines that don't even do what I want them to ! !

His mother knocks to tell him he's late and he shouts " I DON'T ALWAYS MISS WORK / [ Dos Equis guy ] / BUT WHEN I DO , I HAVE A GOOD REASON " and it's close enough to how he normally talks that she doesn't suspect he's a meme now .

An interesting conundrum !
That's weird , but whatever !
MAYBE - just MAYBE - you deserve to live in a world where the thought of another person murdering you , or stealing your coolest stuff , or cheating you , or putting you in a hole and then filling the hole up with ants NEVER ENTERS YOUR MIND because it NEVER HAPPENS .

This is kind of insulting , T - Rex .
Life is too friggin' fragile ! And when I say " life " , I mean life in general , but really , I mean my life in particular .
That's silly .
I can see that !
You say that like it's a bad thing ? ?
OKAY FINE T - REX , HOW ABOUT MATURELY DEALING WITH YOUR INTERPERSONAL PROBLEMS ? THAT IS HILARIOUS RIGHT

First , pick your favorite adjective . May I suggest , " Trending " , " Collectible " , or " Brownish " ? Then pick your second favorite adjective , like " Community " , " Actionable " , or " Macabre " . Don't worry , we're almost done ! Finally , pick a noun or a verb , and it helps if its related to what you do . For example " Tweeting " , " Services " , or if you have a terrible imagination " Corporation " .

I mean that all knowledge can be derived just by thinking about it ! That it can be deduced from just a few axioms that we all start out with , such as a knowledge of self and an understanding of causality .
The remaining aliens , terrified , retreat from Earth and never return . And then millions of years later , the new children of Earth wonder why they seem so alone in the universe : why nobody ever contacts them and why their every signal into space is ignored !
sorry
That's not an adult's nickname ! That's what you call a little kid who investigates mysteries , only she's really just running around with a toy magnifying glass !
Thank you ! I am an extremely mature gentleman , and I'm flattered you noticed .
More than 100 ! Oh snap ! Is that statement FACTUALLY ACCURATE ? ?
Nooo way .
Yes ! Like " The Day I Was EXTRA Nice To The Homeless " !
I think it's a good idea because you loved them , right ? I don't see that changing just because you broke up . They still must be pretty great !
Wait , hear me out !
More like work BOREang -
prepare yourself for a journey into adventure
Let's play a type of " Choose Your Own Adventure " where the path of the story is dictated by how fast you read . Ready . . . set . . . go ! On to the next panel ! ! !
Seriously I could use an explanation ; it is the worst
Yo , I'm not number one but I'm still good / My parents know that I've done / basically the best I could !
UM OF COURSE I KNOW I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU DO
And I'M going to regret asking this , but -
Yep ! So it's not so unreasonable that someone would send this web card . If the other person also had a fancy phone , it would be a discreet way of letting them know !
Dude has his own problems !
It's sincerely excellent !
You owe me 30 clams ! 30 BUCKAZOIDS .
Now , to change the subject , isn't today election day somewhere ?
" HEY . HEY . YOU HAVE SOMETHING STUCK BETWEEN YOUR TEETH "
Things You Can Get For Free
You still have Batman pillowcases on your bed , T - Rex .
Snyes , it it . It's the same snow joke over and over , and anyone could do it , and it's not funny !
It lasted only two hours .
" That's the last time I'm puking into my crotch " ?
Aww , Morris !
Man ! ! Kids with helium balloons were the last thing I could enjoy WITHOUT thinking how finite everything is !
I'm not giving you double high fives , T - Rex .
T - Rex , you have cooties ? !
METHOD 3 : FAKING FOREIGN ACCENTS
So who cares if everything is predetermined then ? If it's utterly convincing that I have free will , what does it matter if it's all predetermined ? I'm still affecting events in ways I choose .
LET'S GO TO MARS
My and forwarded " Lol , Jesus memes ! Funny but respectful ! ! " and added " pooty poot ( ; " .
THEY'RE GOOD
And then he tried to say that it was short for " Arthur " and I said " Oh okay , like when people go to museums to look at visual Arthur " and he got mad and left .
OH MAN
Shoot , it's just 99 . 99999 % of stupid things were done in the past is all
More broccoli , please !
You're intimately familiar with the size and shape of your own body : you're not going to not notice when it changes . I doubt you'd even be able to get out of bed without falling down , your feet hitting the ground in unexpected ways .
I'm high right now !
Superman may seem an obvious choice : his super - speed allows him to speak quickly , and his super - hearing will mean less valuable seconds lost to misunderstanding .
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately UPDOG DOME decree ? ?
Love isn't a weakness , T - Rex . It's a strength !
Have you read it ?
Come on man ! ! I don't want this to be a weird thing ! I just want to OWN the SUN .
alack me ! i'm trying to write some sonnets here , t - rex !
LATER . . .
And now I will demonstrate stomping physics !
Probably She's Attracted To Men Who Are Different From You In Some Way
" Frosty " ( Case # 4253 ! ) has BECOME the north .
MOST OF ITS MASS AND SPEED IS LOST AS IT BURNS UP AND ARRIVES NEAR THE SURFACE AS A MERE WARM PEBBLE THAT BOUNCES OFF YOUR RAISED HAND THUS MAKING YOU A RECIPIENT OF THE ULTRA - RARE
LATER : A MOMENT OF REFLECTION .
Wrecked what ?
There you have it : math is an exercise in pure thought , and nobody's brilliant at it once they get old : PROOF that our minds get all soft and sloppy once we get old ! We should all fear aging as the slow death of self : T - REX OUT .
This is because there are situations in which being polite implies being insincere . For example , I may think someone looks pretty ridiculous in their fancy new hat , but if they ask me what I think , I'll try to say SOMETHING positive about it ! In order not to hurt their feelings , I am polite in sharing my opinion .
SUCKER
Lately I have been questioning my choice to remain single .
Huh . It kinda works ! Life DOES have permadeath .
Oh for sure ! Especially if you have , like , questions about your homework !
LATER , T - REX FEELS REGRET FOR HOW THE CONVERSATION WENT . HE WORRIES THAT UTAHRAPTOR WANTED TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION . BUT HE WAS MAKING JOKES ABOUT BEARS .
But feeling depressed might encourage you to go out and improve yourself , so bad emotions are good too !
T - Rex , I have big news !
Yayyy mortality
Literature has hit a new low !
Cyberneticists study the structure of regulatory systems .
But unlike most ghosts who haunt their descendants , SHE became a ghost in the medieval past . She haunted her ancestors ! She'd say things like " Woooo in the future we'll have cell phones " and he ancestors would say " Is that English ? I can barely recognize it . It sounds so different to our more throaty , Scottish - sounding phonology " .
Bitches is now singular , tell bitches .
Yeah , it was touch and go for a bit . But she pulled through ! !
Oh wow , a movie . . . with a love story in it ? ? OH WOW , a song that's about . . . a relationship ! !
PYGMALION
Sounds like you've got a lot of chores to take care of today !
Global overpopulation !
But I need to pee !
What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger !
no what
They were out of rubber mallets , so I bought a vegetable steamer instead . Now all my problems look like vegetables in need of a good steaming !
Hey Boorishly ! WHATEVER
I find the idea of instincts interesting . What's it like having a drive to do something but not really understanding why ? Have I ever felt an instinctive urge like that ?
A database . . . of MURDERS !
T - Rex maybe we all thing you've been playing too many video games lately !
It -
MIRROR UNIVERSE COMICS
They're laws in the observational sense , not in the prescriptive sense .
We live inside them !
Easy . " You wake up in a room with a degenerative neural disorder ! All that is you is being taken , piece by piece , a little more each day . Sometimes you know how much you've lost . Often you don't . We don't know which is better . "
It interferes with my ability to enjoy the show !
Let's talk this out , Drotimes ! !
No , what news ?
YES . Good idea !
I wish for worldwide peace and love with no negative consequences !
T - REX IS GETTING HIS OUT OF THE WAY EARLY .
Dromiceiomimus ? Have YOU ever done any consciousness - altering drugs ?
How many people did they turn to stone ?
THAT WAS YOU JUST THEN
The few survivors dare only use a handful of protective spells : immortality and flight !
This made his skill not what you'd call " super useful " . He could only read your innermost secrets if he was standing really close to you , and you could stop him by wearing a toque or headband .
Ah , the golden rule . Do unto others as you would have them do unto you !
Are you mentioning punch because the party tonight is so liable to feature punch , T - Rex ?
Maybe we could tweak it a bit though : advance it for the times !
This is going to be so great !
Take a picture , it'll last longer !
They all had quite excellent names !
PERHAPS ! !
There's all these programming languages but there's not one - NOT ONE - that lets you type in " U r a horse and u can shoot bullets from the eyes . NOT A DREAM . There r bad guys 2 shoot and u can get powerups that make you shoot cannonballs from the hooves . " and then a game comes out !
LATER , T - REX'S MOVIE DOESN'T GET MADE
MAKE IT SO .
A false document is when you refer to or quote books and stuff that don't exist in real life , but your whole story pretends like they actually do . Like when Shakespeare reads the dictionary !
It's much more interesting than world politics was anyway . It's got women ! Women in the mood to KISS !
And within hours Hubert is dead of strychnine poisoning and his wife is super sick !
Another rejected overture towards friendship . . .
Wrestling a bear !
IT'S A PHASE .
God , guess what I'M going to do today !
Hey , you're not actually calling Dromiceiomimus " Emily " are you ?
Your head is water resistant , but not water proof . Do not submerge your head underwater for extended periods of time unless you have purchased the " SCUBAPak " accessory kit .
Yes , also that .
I'd be pleased to give a reading !
Okay , here's something : everyone who ever pissed you off is now already dead or going to die , and a lot of those deaths are gonna look just like " natural causes " to the cops .
These are some pretty fantastic assumptions !
Hey Boorishly ! Your name sounds made up ! :
You're just thinking of one or two famous instances ! The problem is that nobody ever remembers when the food DOESN'T run out , the times when nobody ends up getting munched on .
Your super power is shooting sunscreen out of your eyes .
Ouch .
Um . . . ha ha
Gangrene has set in , Helen . I'm afraid . . . I'll . . . I'll have to amputate it .
T - REX HAS A HOUSEGUEST :
Yesterday , he " wigged out " !
To further expedite deductions , Watson started dressing up like a brightly coloured bird . . . a ROBIN .
Oh man , is she serious ?
It's nice to see you too , Morris !
And does it feel like COMING HOME ? ?
HAPPY CANADA DAY COMICS
This planet is definitely going to be around forever !
With wh -
's Wikipedia page
You know , I keep forgetting I need to say " how do you think OTHERS would feel " and not " how would you feel " for questions like this .
GREETING T - REX I COME TO YOU WITH A QUERY
Aw man , seriously ? ! We never get that one figured out ?
Rather than increasingly severe and unusual weather systems , instead climate changed in a way nobody anticipated . . . it became SELF - AWARE . It became . . . ALIVE . And it became ANGRY .
Another good one's " What time is it ? Looks like it's MURDER O'CLOCK "
Maybe for you , my friend ! For me , I only enjoy being 100 % correct 100 % of the time .
Ah yes , a moral I hold near and dear to my heart .
And there's nothing you can do without making things MORE awkward !
Wait - SEVERAL of them ?
Now I'm way over here because I can ACTUALLY SEE stink lines coning off of you . There are little cartoon fish skeletons between the stink lines . You know what they're whispering in my ear , T - Rex ?
Even if the films were black and white , folks could see the potential . Essays were written extolling how movies with sound and colour were just around the corner , and they'd be cheap to make , and when that happened we as a species will have done something amazing : we will have CONQUERED DEATH ITSELF .
. . . It sounds weird when I say it out loud .
I didn't realize such situations occurred in real life . . . a young woman , engaged to be married to an older man , meets a dynamic young one and falls in love !
SORRY
You'll think , " Hey , I wanna call Ricky ! " and then , digits will glow on your palm . you punch them in and then make your hand into a phone shape ! Talk into your pinkie while listening on your thumb , and when you're done , you just mime hanging up ! That's the future , my friends . Cell phones built into our friggin' hands !
I mean , I invented a new thing to do with computers !
What are you talking about ? Yes there is . Nobody told you ?
I like details in my erotic fiction , T - Rex . How hot is this person ? What makes them hot ? What are they doing with their lives ? What are their interests ? How did they feel before , during , and after ?
Or book , if this comic has been collected in book form !
God , do you like poutine ?
And your bro is like " frig bro I dunno . "
Thomas died only adfter ACCIDENTALLY STRANGLING HIMSELF in a system of pullies he invented . An accident ? Or the last act of his original mind , desperate to end his reign of destruction ? ? In conclusion , the oceans are terrifying and will swallow us all , the end .
Obviously I do ! It only took a little . . . TIME ? ?
I'M NOT SAYING SHE'S A GOLD DIGGER
T - Rex , I feel like my life could be improved . Are there any ways I can improve it ?
UM EXCUSE ME T - REX BUT GAMES DON'T GET OLD
Girl I gotta step to the hospital , but you know when I get out I'ma kiss your oral cavity . I'm gonna moisten my lips with liquid excreted by specialized internal glads , and I'll press those excretion covered lips all up against you .
It seems obvious that no authentic educational institution would award a degree on such credentials , and if they did , those degrees wouldn't be worth anything . Nut try explaining that to someone thousands of dollars deep into one : it's like talking to someone in a pyramid scheme , multi - level marketing , AND / OR cult !
So you've got lots of countries , right ? Only , you can dismiss about 90 % of these , since they don't really affect the agreed - upon " world scene " .
I really thought computers were deterministic !
Classically , one would make private resolutions and endeavour to carry these out over the new , unblemished year . However , this tradition has changed over time !
Why not captain a trip to the Antarctic ?
It was more of a " trip to the grocery store' than a vacation , T - Rex .
Patrick Stewart ? Is he really that loaded that he gives money away for funny jokes ?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US IN SOME ILLEGAL DRUGS , NEIGHBOUR ?
. . . That wasn't very terrifying , dude .
" LATER ON , THE CALL OF ADVENTURE WAS HEARD "
My body has failed me for the first time ever !
Ah , but you see , as easily as I can swap my monocle . .
Seriously ? We go to the south pole at great personal cost and don't even get there first ?
I'm literally saying two things : a ) something is nice , and b ) it would be sad if a bad thing happened to the nice thing . BOTH ARE SINCERE .
Alright guys , I'll go right out and say it . We could all use a little SEXUAL TENSION al up ons !
I do that with all major world religions though ! For example , Christianity ?
Whoah I didn't even know I could make that sound !
People's last words are sometimes awesome . It's a thing : if they get the chance to , folks choose them carefully ! In contrast , people's first words are usually boring , similar AND similarly boring !
Well , if you REALLY believe that by not sharing your religion , your partner is harming himself somehow ( i . e . , comdemning himself to a sucky afterlife ) , then you'd want to help him out , right ? I could see that leading to tension , since there's not much room for movement there unless one of you softens your views .
. . . Which is actually awesome , so um , let's put this one down in the " actually awesome " column .
Brrr . . . it's getting cold out !
It sort of sucks , man !
And your printer's almost out of ink so there's weird lines on it ? ?
I will be a racially stereotyped informant named " Miguel Sanchez " !
ZERO IDEA WHERE TO START
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX IS A BALLET DANCER !
YES . From now on , I don't care if something is good . I just care if it's popular !
That's all pretty cool I GUESS , but it's still not like I'm getting Christmas cards from Patty Stew and Jonno Frakes . But you know what IS great ? The name of the dude who came up with the idea !
So what show is it about ?
" Identified sources of oxygen - rich gasses in order to reach continued viability targets " ?
Aw , thanks T - Rex !
The ultimatum game is an economics game thing ! Two anonymous strangers have to decide how to divide a sum of money between themselves .
Nostalgia .
OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD THE HMS SINKYTOWNE BE MADE OUT OF
THE HOLY GRAIL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
that part should be obvious
Violence can also be an effective way of saying " no " !
Finally , experiment with remembering your man's interests ! That way , when a gift is called for , you can look for one that dovetails nicely with his interests . He won't forget it !
My rhymes are so oldschool , the school is still new !
All funny t - shirts use the same unmodified t - shirt canvas :
Well , the rules of travel for the particular set of tickets I bought . Rerouting is not permitted !
There are some good emojis , but there are not yet ALL the good emojis .
So romantic !
Of course , we all know what happened next . Once he and his men left the beach , the forest wilderness shimmered and faded , revealing its holographic nature . Columbus was about to discover the terrible secret of Earth : that America was not a continent . It was a SPACESHIP : an ancient crashed colony ship from a race of expansionist , technology - obsessed ALIENS held in suspended animation .
So - - what , stick with the friends you already have forever ?
I gave them to my mother for her birthday ! What a good son !
GOOD NAMES FOR BABIES
ALREADY .
No . No , I think we covered it pretty well earlier .
AND I SURE HOPE YOU BROUGHT SOME , because I'm tapped !
Ha , no way !
You chat for a while . You tell him of your day ; he tells you about his . It's a pleasant way to pass the time , and soon you have forgotten all about your decision to effect some change in your daily routine . Turn to panel 5 .
NEVER PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU LIKE BATMAN
Okay , so there's those scam messages where someone has millions of illegal dollars , and they need your help to get them out of the country , and in return they'll give you a generous percentage !
Hah ! It would be awesome if there was a clock wipe right now , cutting to me three minutes later , behind bars and shouting " I believe there's nothing particularly funny about my new circumstances ! "
If I owe someone a hundred bucks , I've got a problem . But only if they remember the debt !
Well , okay , but nobody want to invite someone to a wedding whose toast is going to be " This too shall pass " !
Yes . AND ? ?
T - REX -
NEXT WEEK : " BEETS "
So , new punctuation marks ?
That's because I'VE come up with a way to never be wrong again !
Excellent ! Um , how much energy ?
Teens will say that before stepping away for a bit to read some classic literature ! Teens , man ! ! They make me want to ROFL too !
" As every action has an equal and opposite reaction , I tripped down the stairs again , owie " ?
We have many weapons at our disposal , and yet , our on great endeavour - our one great obsession - is not yet weaponized .
Onomatopoeia ruins relationships , never use it
Wow nobody ? ?
That only makes it sound more alluring !
You have lost your voice , but luckily , you can still communicate through sign language ! Unluckily , you don't know any sign languages .
Noticing such things in spoken language is impossible !
It's very nice to meet you , Jimbo Wales , founder and president of Wikipedia !
Piercing Orange !
What he has , Dromiceiomimus , is a gift ! The gift is labelled " best accent ever " .
T - Rex , you are an elite professional .
I did some research into " radio waves " and they travel EVERYWHERE , even through brains ! DJ chatter is LITERALLY MOVING INSIDE YOUR BRAIN 24 / 7 . My whole body , polluted by people who think the best way to hear a song is to phone a stranger and ask if they can maybe work it in !
What you wanna do
Ooh , can I come along on the adventure through time ? Please ?
Does it ?
But then every time you'd eat something , you'd have no idea how it'll taste !
It's so you can imagine a man slapping a woman after an unwanted kiss , and then you get to examine your ideas of gender roles and heteronormativity
HEY TELL HIM ABOUT MY BUSINESS IDEA
Exactly ! But maybe this is the best possible world for YOU , personally . Maybe this is as close to heaven as you'll ever get !
Then when it blows up in my face , I'll - Um !
Cut ! Cut , cut , cut !
I've dramatically echoed as hard as I can , but it seems I'm destined not to move ahead in time faster than my usual rate of one second per second .
SOME OF THE ORGANS ARE FULL
Sounds rad ! Where is it ?
But especially me ! !
My freestyle rap is a bunch of crap ; I got low self esteem and that's about that
Ten years ago peeps were like , " hey , I have a great idea : let's use computers to talk to our pals and call it 'social networking' ! " And we were all like " hey , great idea , I've been looking for something to do with this computer anyway ! "
Sweeeeet
The result is an object that is at once reviewed AND reviewer , challenging the classical divide between the two and inviting us to examine our own preconceptions !
I should be getting WAY MORE DATES .
Wait nevermind I hate that already ! And - - I kinda hate myself for saying it too ! Wow , this is what it feels like to roll a critical failure when writing ! !
Hollah ! !
" To summarize the sex we just had , " said CHARACTER B OR D , sighing happily , " I would say : LINE FROM ANY SPEECH BY WINSTON CHURCHILL . "
T - REX'S MANLIEST MAN :
That girl with the brown hair certainly is a " dish " !
How do you do that ?
HELLO ! I ATE THREE BURGERS TODAY !
If you love him so much then why don't you marry him ?
LET'S GO
Oh man , imagine a guy who orders a big steak dinner with all the fixings , and then when it's delivered , he just flips it onto the floor !
You know , eventually !
Your parents were totally awesome !
FIFTY YEARS LATER
After everyone remembers that , it's on to Round Two !
Hey , I bet if I ignore him , it will arouse a reaction !
Oh , you should , T - Rex ! Then we could talk to each other !
So what are you thinking , baby ? Yes or no ?
That's not the worst part . Even if only ONE SINGLE COPY of each of these 2 . 2 million titles is printed , that's still 2000 CUBIC METERS of space that's now filled with book .
In fact , ALL information in a computer - text , video , sound , even PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES - are stores in the same fashion , as 1s and 0s . Here's the interesting part :
We are going to RIDE OUR BIKES TO PIECES as soon as the weather permits , T - Rex ! !
Is there a superhero that SHOULDN'T be a scientist , in your estimation ?
Yes my friends , spring will be coming soon !
LATER , T - REX MEETS A REAL WIZARD :
I've got to rescue the real Utahraptor !
We had a full five weekends in January too .
LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS today's technique : LAMPSHADE HANGING
You're basically sticking to the canonical five senses ! I would have bet the first sense you'd give up is your sense of EMPATHY , or your sense of what's appropriate to say in social situations .
Yes everyone , we need to politicize Santa before someone else does it first ! It's a race to the bottom !
I've got no new frontiers to challenge ! Do I quit while I'm ahead ? That seems like a waste of all effort . or do I power throgh and continue painting as my body begins to fail , trying to recall my earlier successes as my work inevitably declines , sliding towards self - parody ?
I murdered up a senior citizen !
I've got one !
Well , you talk like you are , sometimes !
I knew it ! !
OH NO NOW YOU FELL INTO A MUD PUDDLE AND TORE YOUR PANTS
Nope ! Weird . I always assumed that you had the same sleep schedule as I did !
Truly , Buddhism is the way for me !
But nobody says " Oh my God , are you okay ? ? " to mean " Oh my God , do you have a sufficient salary ? ? "
French has problems , English has problems .
Damn it T - Rex , you're obsessed ! You want your " bicuriosity " satisfied ? ! We'll satisfy it right now !
Oh , what you'd expect , really .
I actually think it would be fascinating !
WELL HONESTLY I'D BE SO MAD I'M NOT SURE IF I'D TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE IT DOWN
Um , " love " is there and it's not actually about love at all ?
FACT .
i'm not shakespeare , i'm francis bacon !
WAIT ! Don't you worry that other dinos will start putting you in their bad books ?
Here at ClothesCorp , we know you love covering up your naked body . But then we thought , wouldn't it be nice if your bod felt slightly nicer ? So we've made our full line of clothing so much more comfortable , we had to name it . . . More Comfortable ? !
The future's got all the time in the world !
HEY T - REX HAVE YOU EVER PULLED ANY SWEET PRANKS
That's uh - that's actually the whole thing . Grasshopper starves and begs Ant for food , but he , through a mouthful of food , tells Grasshopper to dance her hunger away instead . Grasshopper starves to death , THE END , I HOPE YOU ENJOYED STORYTIME ? ?
But BATMAN can ! !
So you put the cards into piles and move them around according to a bunch of rules somebody else invented . And eventually you'll say " Man , this game , what's the deal with this game , probably I should cheat at this game " . But you're playing by yourself ! Who are you cheating ? Yourself ? The game ? Would it help if I told you that almost 20 % of solitaire games are PROVABLY UNWINNABLE ?
Well , T - Rex . . . maybe it is you a little , you know ? You do kind of talk yourself up a bit .
There is a person who has been with us for generations . Centuries ! MILLENNIA ! He has a name , but we always refer to him by his title instead . And it's a title that not everyone gets to have !
Look at this weird old photo of some guy I found !
Crazy !
HELLO NSA , HOW ARE YOU
. . . Like Joan of Arc and I'm pretty sure there's others
English doesn't have a word for " parody lyrics that rhyme with the lyric it's parodying " !
THEN you should be careful . Don't say " AUSTRALIA : you don't need to be a force'evolved primate to take deals like THIS by force ! " . Instead say , " We # RememberAustralia with the following deals : " . Classy , you know ?
Dollars for sale , you guys !
Aw , Morris ! You don't look very undead to me !
I don't know , man ! Stop traveling ? Encase unspoiled areas in amber ? Use spaceships to colonize new planets and therefore delay the issue until there are no new frontiers ?
I was down at the beach last week and there were all these adorable little hermit crabs running around ! They were so cute that I scooped up a bunch and brought them home !
AND NOBODY IS SURPRISED .
Is there ANYONE on this Earth who can love me ?
One telegram , please ! !
No ! ! He's supposed to read his OWN mind and get REAL GOOD at , you know , self actualization and stuff .
- you know some !
FIFTEEN DAYS LATER AND THIRTY YEARS AGO :
BUT SECRETLY . . .
Hitler !
But now we think it's because they have sensitive hands !
I kinda miss having friends , I GUESS
I CHOOSE to live in a world where one day all this sex could stress me out , seriously interfering with my work and productivity
So ?
Contractions ! They're useful when we want to say " do not " but don't have time to say EVERY SOUND in our sentence because we're all SUCH BUSY PEOPLE , so instead we say " don't " .
" Short and stout ; squat ! "
I'll say I am ! Who are these creeps , anyway ?
So - what ? It's a machine that is happy ? A happy robot ?
So now you go to parties and just have a good time ?
Facial hair ?
Nooooooope
Any time you're ready .
It's actually just a subset of the larger problem of orphaned works still under copyright . How can such works be dealt with when it's impossible or prohibitively expensive to figure out who owns the rights ?
T - Rex ! People often use Wikipedia as an important " first source " . You'll confuse them so hard !
What's today ? Friday ? Is it Friday ? Or is it . . .
Dear guy whose car alarm went off last night outside my window at three in the morning :
Well if she likes food she'd better learn fast !
This party rules , T - Rex !
It's there because God's all " NOAH BUILD AN ARK OUT OF GOPHERWOOD OKAY " but now we're all , " what ? Um , maybe he meant cypress wood ? Did somebody transcribe this friggin' poorly ? " It's cool how unlikely we are to ever discover anything new about a hapax !
Okay , you've lost me : how is wasting food manly ?
PLEASE . DON'T . TALK . LIKE . I'M . NOT . HERE . T - REX .
Ever since she was six , Tina Rex knew that she was one day to wake up as a man !
Then he remembered that he did ! BLOOD GOT EVERYWHERE
What the - ? ! I didn't want to say that ! !
I'm serious ! People get son hung up on finding " the one " that they forget everything else . You can have an entirely rewarding life without being " so madly in love " with someone ! Close friendships and a private room can offer most of the things love does .
I wonder what could have happened ?
You have no hair and want to be a hairdresser . You have stubby arms and want to be a boxer . Why not get a job that plays to your strengths ?
Just turn it down ! Everyone within 100 metres can hear it . If you don't I'll call the cops , for serious .
I'm looking in a mirror right now , which flips any reversed image back again !
Have they event tried putting the pedal ALL the way to the metal ?
Make " blood punch " , " monster eyes " or " witch hair " !
I found out about the best word yesterday : " frigorific " ! It means " cold " . With this word I can now finally say the sentence , " DAAAAMN , girlfriend , that was totally frigorific ! "
You know what the most common element in the universe is ? Friggin' hydrogen !
Yeah , because most ancient texts are lost forever ! I'd bet less than 10 % of movies are lost and I'm sure more than that amount of text is gone .
I was going to say how I regretted not doing anything with my family's garden this year , but Dromiceiomimus is a tough act to follow .
ONE TIME , I snuck onto a friend's computer while at his house and altered an essay he was writing for school about EVIL . All I did for instant hilarity was relace every instance of the word " evil " with the phrase " Irish evil " !
Being born a seasoned combat veteran with the scars to prove it ? Being born a cannibal ? GETTING BORN ONLY BECAUSE YOU WERE THE TOUGHEST , HUNGRIEST FOETUS IN ALL OF U - TOWNE ? ?
Turn to panel 2 to hear more about Utahraptor ; stare at this panel for a while if you kinda don't want to .
AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO HACK IT SO YOU GET MORE WISHES
Okay . Frig though , right ?
I just think that if you go into this wedding evaluating all the guests by their hookup potential , it'll colour your wedding experience in a really weird way .
Would you say you're . . . PAST TENSE with whoever corrected you ?
True ! But sir , I think you'll find that you're forced to agree : THIS ISN'T MOST SCREENPLAYS .
Yes ! Yes .
That kinda sounded like just a bunch of buzzwords .
Does anyone else's web browser have this weird bug here the internet's really boring and then you get sad
They tasted like chalk , but looked like Jane Austen ! Fishstick Austen ! !
Hit on the head by a falling koala bear !
Yeah , I like it . Do you think it's important to stay true to hardware limitations ( ie : using only 16 or 256 colours ) or can the style be divorced from its technological origin - and if so , does that cost it something essential ?
HOW TO BUILD A TIME MACHING even if you're a TEEN
The best form of monarchy is CONSTITUTIONAL monarchy ! Perhaps you could even say that it's the
I made it myself ! It also applies to non - Stephs .
But why does that make the gift better ?
What was I talking about . . . ? Oh yeah , the " walk of shame " - it's a stupid term and they should call it the " Walk of I'm Still Hungry for Ice Cream ; Let's Go Get More Ice Cream . "
Man ! I think that's pretty obvious !
Gosh darn it ! If these rappers spoke more slowly , we'd ALL be able to understand what they're saying .
Check mine out ! Rar .
I have finally completed my theory of everything , toiling in selfless , unappreciated obscurity .
NOT WELL
That's actually not that many so I guess we're good ! !
For example , the word " short " is itself short , and the word " multisyllabic " has more than one syllable in it . Soooo crazy !
Dromiceiomimus ! I have some very special compliments for sale . Would you like to buy a compliment , gorgeous ? ( That one is on the house ! )
I didn't invite you over to eat all my cookies , T - Rex !
Holy crap , this premise is rad ! SO MUCH WOULD CHANGE . But ? how did this happen ? Why is there no friction ?
Because bikes have spokes ! !
But PERHAPS by making everything special , by spreading that divinity around a bit so that everyone gets a piece , we'll all see our world as the extraordinary place it is .
I KNOW
And you want the recipient of this card to leave you alone with your feelings ?
Neat !
HERE'S A CAT FACT T - REX YOU CAN'T SPELL " FACTS " WITHOUT JUMBLING UP THE LETTERS IN " CATS "
Okay but still , it's spreading the idea that all men care about is sex and that they're unable or unwilling to distinguish between sex good and bad .
Awesome ! Okay , what was it you wanted to talk about ?
What about time travellers breaking character ?
During !
Yes . On account of the golly gosh - darned scurvy .
We start with the number of planets orbiting red suns !
UM BUT I ALSO LIKE LONG - TERM RELATIONSHIPS ! ! MY INTERESTS INCLUDE : LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH . . . WHERE WE MAKE OUT AND FINE DINING . . . WHERE WE MAKE OUT AND LONG INTIMATE TALKS IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE . . . ABOUT MAKING OUT , AND HOW WE CAN DO THAT IF WE WANT
And you agree that this is the right thing for me to do , assuming nobody is hurt through the stomping .
What's left ?
Don't you love Bill Cosby , Mr . Pterydactyl ?
I've had to smooth some ruffled feathers at my job too !
Only if you answer me a question !
You know what ? We should have a party tonight at my place , just because it's so nice . Could you come ?
That reference is as old as your phone !
Find people you don't know and say " Oh , hello there ! I want to talk to you because you are a stranger , and I'm assuming you could be valuable for me ! Hey ! Interesting tidbit about myself : this is ACTUALLY how I build relationships . "
This is true !
But it didn't work . The situation was so unerotic , and I was terrified of becoming visibly aroused !
Wait . . . does that even make sense ?
Man , you're right ! What was I thinking ? Well , you can REST ASSURED that I'll be taking this up with God at my earliest convenience .
OKAY BUT THE THING IS NOTHING IS REALLY SECRET FROM ME GOD
Why not ?
So what's the amazing part ?
No way , man !
I'm not sure hair works that way .
Nature is full of cute animals , but most cute animals don't like to be hugged !
CONCLUSION : Any friend you make through small talk is suspect , for you will always wonder if they actually like you , or if they've just hung out for years because they do not know how to extricate themselves from the conversation .
CLIMATE CHANGE COMICS
Why shouldn't I stomp them all ?
T - REX IN : " MAN , I " M AMAZING . "
Distributing caps ? ?
It's not THAT unlikely that she'd choose your number !
But that's because there's not much we actually know about Shakespeare's life .
AND MAYBE SEE A DOCTOR ; THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WRONG INSIDE YOU
So where are you gonna start ?
There's a way we can turn this realization of yours into something more positive , T - Rex !
That happen regularly over 500 million years ? Hah ! PLEASE . Asteroids strike at unpredictable intervals , not according to some cosmic clock !
WELL NO BUT I CAN MAKE IT SO IT IS IF YOU WANT
I'll do better , Utahraptor ! I'm going to come up with a clean , safe , cheap , efficient , and powerful , renewable energy source THAT CURES CANCER .

What are you doing ? !
Hello , my name is Art !
T - Rex , you missed his birthday ! It was days ago !
T - REX IN " THE SEARCH FOR GOD "
DON'T FREAK OUT LADIES BUT I AM THE DUDE WHO BRILLIANTLY WOVE GHOSTS AND ZOMBIES INTO THE SAME CONTINUITY ! ! : 0 : 0 ; 0
No , for after I beat up a dude and want to imply that he's actually a woman , in case he's the sort of guy who gets mad at that ! Although I COULD also use it if I fought women - like , a cabal of sex , yet EVIL librarians !
Fine new SEXY ladies !
Not really ! It was disturbing until I realized what happened , and then it was still kinda disturbing , but in a " I wish I slept with someone on a regular basis because they'd be so FREAKED OUT by this " kinda way .
It can be argued that in every rational person ( the definition of 'rational' is a touchy subject I won't discuss here ) there are certain properties common to all . The problem ( well , one problem ) with relativism is how it nihilistically privileges the experience of the individual above all else , making every ethical decision the right ethical decision : who would not like to have his or her beliefs guaranteed to be as correct as anybody else's ? But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities , turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures ( and continents and skin colours ) we all believe some of the same things . With that striking fundamental truth removed , the baby - rapers and the saints stand side by side , equals in righteousness .
What's sports day ? Why are we talking about it ?
And it USED to be a good adjective , until Daffy Duck showed up and stole it and now when I say " daffy " everyone thinks " duck " ! He only wants the adjective for himself ! He got GREEDY .
Me too ! It's all I want out of life ! !
So the game plays itself .
But , are you not forgetting the memorable emotion of hunger ?
No , I was asking God -
We're focusing too much on the mistakes of the past . Let's get back to the future , shall we ?
You were writing a horror story ?
The gold change races across the planet's surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave , transmuting it instantly . In seconds , the Earth's iron - nickel core becomes pure non - ferrous gold , and the planet's magnetic field is lost . Unshielded from solar wind , every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation . The soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it , and begins to buckle and distort .
Phew , it was all a dream !
WHY do we keep them in our KITCHENS ? !
And - WAIT A MINUTE , how did you know my fantasy ? ! I only thought it and didn't say it ! You read my mind !
And foodstuffs ! !
And I'm told that when you hold your newborn child in your arms for the first time , this is a transcendental and joyous life - changing event . Sure , fine ! I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU . But why are these pleasures just related to reproduction ? Why can't I have the joy of having a child without actually HAVING to have the child ?
Okay , forget sonnets with their rules ( nested within rules ) you know what's easy ? free verse free verse ( with purchase ? ) baby
April Fool's Day !
all over the internet
Or if he worked as a chipmunk , he'd say " I'm going to ho - ho - hoard all these nuts ! "
It doesn't hurt ! If a random character says " that's dumb " , I'll listen . But if SHAKESPEARE says it , I'm spitting out my drink and saying " Wow , Shakespeare ! ! I'd better listen to THIS line of dialogue right away ! "
YES , THIS IS T - REX'S POKER FACE . HE MAKES EYE CONTACT , SMILES , AND WHISPERS " POOOOOKER "
But that's too easy . We have to complicate up that business !
I almost got into a fight with a COMPLETE STRANGER . We were just two incredibly intense guys !
We can be at a party and someone can say " Where's Utahraptor ? " and I can say " He's sick " and they understand that he's not here BECAUSE he's sick . Inferred meaning ! If they don't assume I'm cooperating then I'm just offering non - relevant information , on the same level as if I answered " Utahraptor's got shufflepants . " and then clarified " They're pants that shuffle when he walks . "
Alright , last one , everyone ! " Both of them . "
No ! You always have the big meal the night BEFORE Thanksgiving Day !
But you didn't tease this person , right ?
I've never really cared about being rich before , but on the other hand having disposable income is sort of alright ! Is wanting more money the first step on the path to becoming more and more right wing as I get older ? Such a trajectory IS one I have sometimes observed in my peers and elders .
I say largely because I like to keep my options open . Anyway !
It's fun !
Is it wrong to want things that are terrible ?
Ohh , the world revolves around me !
NOW IT'S LATER , AND T - REX HAS GOTTEN A CHEQUE FROM UTAHRAPTOR COVERING A DEBT OF $ 85 . 49 !
W - who am I ?
Ah , an untalented person ! It originally meant " someone doing ordinary work " , which itself came from the 13th century " hackney " , which was , YOU GUESSED IT , an ordinary horse .
This meat is extremely delicious !
So Utahraptor's chasing the main character of T - Rex , right ? On foot . But then it escalates ! Soon they're chasing on jury - rigged rollerblades . Then in expensive cars that they find ! Then the cars explode , and they're thrown from the explosion straight into waiting GYROCOPTERS . And THEN , the gyrocopters crash on boats and they chase on the boats !
The only time I can imagine using it is - well , when describing you .
INDICATES HOORAY
I'm not sure this is good advice .
Here are some things that are sad !
If you don't , come back when you've learned them all . Don't worry , we'll ONLY be using the words found in this comic , so it shouldn't take too long . Ready ? Perfect .
Yeah , it's pretty great .
I dunno
Ha ha . Old Billy Cosby .
Not at all ! It's aggressive advertising that intrudes on our public spaces , and since it adds to congestion on the roads , ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE'S LIVES QUANTIFIABLY WORSE . The time lost stuck behind an ad truck can be traced directly to some jerk who thought his message was more important than minutes from your LIFE .
With the exception of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , which must go to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ because they _ _ _ _ _ _ _ all over my _ _ _ _ _ _ _ three times . Furthermore , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ must spend three _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in a haunted _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , where _ _ _ _ _ _ _ will _ _ _ _ _ _ _ them over and over .
Because nothing makes you look like a sympathetic , well - adjusted person than going on TV and shouting about how Santa's a big fraud ! Even their own friends will wince and whisper " oh no , sweetie , no , stop " when they see that . It's foolproof !
THE WORLD
I'll save you the trouble ; the answer is " YES , OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE ! "
T - Rex , this is no time to begin stomping on houses !
" Titanic " was a pretty okay name for a movie , but it would've been WAY better if they'd called it " Titanic ? ! " !
It's been weeks , T - Rex !
Nobody can argue with that ! !
Clothes that speak of identity ?
The idea here is that there's a dude named Dionysius who decided that everything worthwhile has already been said , but maybe , just MAYBE , it hasn't been said well enough ? So you stand on the shoulder and read what they wrote and say " Calm down everybody , I got this " and then you rewrite it ! Literature gets better over time as authors rewrite great works over and over again !
It was a pretty good . . . stomp . . . I suppose . But you're not the greatest T - Rex . That title belongs to Steve on the other side of the river .
Seriously , where is the Friend Zone ? I'd like to go there RIGHT NOW please .
T - REX WHY DON'T YOU RATE ALL YOUR FRIEND FROM BEST TO WORST
But . . . what if you're already IN hell ?
But I don't HAVE any simple ways to improve lives ! Try being lucky ? Don't make bad decisions if you're about to do that ? Always be healthy - um , somehow ? Maybe don't be a crazy racist ?
Man , that too ! !
Only at the BEST BACHELOR PARTY IN THE WORLD ! !
ADVENTURES IN METAPHORS !
We were , sadly , not ALWAYS so smart !
I helped an old lady across the street and suddenly was $ 5 richer !
Aww ! Well , I'll be their friend , unless there's a good reason why they don't have any friends , such as rampant murderism or incurable stealie - o - holicism .
Excuse me , God ! What's being a ghost like ?
I WAS CLEARLY REFERRING TO SIMPLER VIDEO GAMES BUILT FOR A CASUAL AUDIENCE
Okay , new theory : BAD emotions are for the weak !
Is it that time again ? Has the hour finally been struck ? Should I send not to know for whom the bell tolls , because it tolls for me ? IS IT TRULY TIME . . .
SEX SCENES FOR HORSES
" I Wish I Remembered What It Said , As It Can Stop An Angry Polish - Speaking Man Wielding A Rocket Launcher In His Tracks "
ANGRY words !
. . . Maybe by making them more awesome ?
Then Spider - Man " webbed " his way out of the room , leaving behind the remains of the cake and webbing , stuck to the ceiling , walls , floors and furniture . " Who's going to clean up THIS fine mess ? " asked a member of the custodial staff , and then he said " Hah hah , no , it's me ; I know it's me . " He liked his job : the satisfaction of seeing progress being made in a task was something that pleased him greatly .
T - REX IN : SOLVING PROBLEMS BY DECLARING PARTS OF YOUR LIFE TO BE NON - CANON
But here's the crazy part : forks still took HUNDREDS of years to reach Europe . They made sense in Italy because of pasta , but the rest of Europe was like " wow , forks are for stupid babies " , due to their Italian Racisms ! So they just DID WITHOUT .
. . . FOR MORE EUPHEMISMS FOR SEX ? ?
In CONCLUSION , anachronism , anthropomorphism and allusion are the only three literary techniques ! There aren't any others . Okay there were some others but they died .
Just this guy I know , alright ?
You are reading about polygamy , after all .
Ted's so great . I just want to hang out with him all day long !
OH , REAL MATURE EVERYONE
Right ! " Nyther men nor rockyn babes " .
AAAAAHHHHH
I'm giving thanks for spanks ! It's like , a sex thing !
It captures the ESSENCE of masculinity : doing stuff that we think is cool , even though there's many a good reason not to do it !
Geez , well . I got no tips on that . I mean , I've tried video games ; they're pretty good . When you beat a video game it's PRETTY fulfilling .
Shakespeare wrote in rhyming couplets and it was great / I bet I could do the same and not desecrate !
Do you think it would work ?
Alright , alright . Things I Need To Do Today :
. . . I'm PRETTY SURE I figured out a way to have sex when it's JUST YOU
Okay ! Well , I think my answer HAS to be . . . " wow , whatever the opposite is of what I did this morning " ? ?
Here are some useful expressions to say when confronted with someone's baby !
And if WOLVES have been taking advantage of us for thousands of years , it raises the question : who ELSE is ? Which someone OR SOMEONES has been subtly influencing our behaviour on a planetary scale for generations ? ?
I know that folks got opinions about rape ! I'm one of 'em !
MANY MONTHS LATER :
Oh are you saying my EROTICA FOR HORSES didn't satisfy you ? ? Are you gonna review me on Yelp and say " NOT ENOUGH HORSE EROTICA " ? ?
Well , Utahraptor , I'm glad you asked . I've compiled a list of my friends and I am stomping on those who are not on my list !
I said it was time for me to lady up and clean the bathroom and then get some groceries !
Can we play AR games RIGHT NOW , The Devil ?
In a shouted sentence ?
THAT'S SOMETHING
That'll be fun , eh ?
AW MAN ! ! That was it ! And the stale wet laundry smells the worst of all the things ! !
It will show me what tomorrow is like , tomorrow !
And if I ever need to perform CPR on you , you can bet I'LL be belting it out at the top of my lungs .
LATER : T - REX LEARNS THE CORRECT SAYING IS ? DOG - EAT - DOG WORLD ?
The thing is , I've had YEARS of practice at thinking sexy thoughts ; I've got that down COLD . But I'm a rank amateur when it comes to this !
You know what would go down if Nintendo came over ? I'd sat " Oh hello , Nintendo ! It's so nice to see you again ! "
Over what ? Batman punching or being a good member of society ?
THERE'S THAT TOO
But I thought we - we could get through this disease . . . together ?
Two separate limbs or combo tentacle / gun limbs ?
I would argue , " yes " !
My ending has the Google guys inventing the internet , but instead of http : / / www . website . com it's " i'mhungryforsubs : / / yaysubs . website . stillbigintosubsoverhere " !
I heard someone was hating on grapefruits ! !
Let's say I have a joke about how cats like to sleep . NOT FUNNY , right Dromiceiomimus ? Everyone who's met a sleepy ol' cat can get that . But if I have a joke about how , say , an obscure programming language is pretty wacky , then people who know that language will feel like I'm talking to them ! They laugh both at the joke AND in recognition . Comedy increases , and the only reasonable conclusion is " laughs ahoy ! "

My new book is called " BILLY THE TEEN ! BILLY WAS THE TEEN . . . WHO LOVED BEING A TEEN ! "
Well , maybe the magazine will pique my interest !
Yep ! And anything to do with babies and ESPECIALLY the one that barfed on me .
So what's your solution ?
Lets say you're an ancient seaborne intelligence who can alter mortal minds and hates other life and wants to raise sea levels so that it can drown the Earth . What do you do ? I'll tell you what to do : you take over one man's mind and use him as a pawn ! !
Yaaaay cooking !
OH WELL !
Oh , with high fives standing in for sex ? It's not THAT interesting . Our culture equates virility with manliness , and so , hey presto , someone who can get more people pregnant is manlier ! It's super dumb because getting someone pregnant isn't difficult ! People do it accidentally ALL THE TIME .
Geez , that was kind of rude , T - Rex !
FACT : Every mosquito you ever killed is now a ghost , trying to bite you at all times ! And the same goes for spiders !
Dude , we have to start it ! !
I have just had the greatest idea . Oh my goodness . Everyone named " Jennifer " will probably hate me .
It's a joke that plays off gender stereotypes ! Here , I'll prove it via the scientific method . . . OF ASKING RANDOM MEN WHAT THEY THINK !
By that logic , you cheat death constantly .
Man , whatever ! These chips are overwhelmingly delicious !
R - Really ?
These wouldn't happen to be URBAN LEGENDS , would they , T - Rex ?
Maube because quicksand's not a threat , yo !
Okay ! Thanks for that !

Aw man ! I SERIOUSLY FORGOT TO BUY ANY SNACKS . I am the worst party host ever !
That's a house , T - Rex .
So you don't want to see marine life when someone says " a whale of a good time " ?

ENTHUSIASTS OF THINGS THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF
Hummingbirds have to eat their weight in nectar every day or they DIE .
If we're going to walk around saying we don't live on bread alone , maybe we should've checked to make sure that I can't bake vitamin pills into some mushy , watery bread . BECAUSE I CAN . I DID . I PUT IT IN MY MOUTH AND ATE IT .
To whom ? " Hi ! You seem like a woman who appreciates her Nazi memorabilia " ? No , I can't just pass this off on someone else : it just shifts these issues onto them . I've got to handle this myself .
Can you clarify how cold your house is , perhaps with a Star Wars analogy ?
THEY'RE FUNNY .
It'll go on your resume , dude ! Real talk ! !
Man , Alzheimer's ? I mean , I know this disease has always been an issue for me , but it's so terrible . And honestly , it sounds like something out of bad fiction . It's ridiculous on the same level as " always cries " . It shouldn't happen .
A dog !
We're deep in uncharted theological territory here , Utahraptor ! !
Hello ? Dialing 555 - 0001 and then 0002 and then 0003 ?
I mean , I love that STUFF . I love that they have the ability to be so confused that the only response is a question mark , the essence of pure confusion . Sometimes they also speak with the essence of pure exclamation , and at others , with the essence of pure ellipsis .
Today is a good day I think for people volunteering unwanted personal information about themselves !
# SKYBUMS
I say this WITH exaggeration : this has been THE MOST DISAPPOINTING DAY IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE , in this or any other universe , real or imagined ; across all timelines , this day - - my day - - is the objective , subjective , figurative and literal worst .
The HELL ? This is my last chance to make people to do things for money , and you're saying they're not legally bound to do it ?
I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus !
That's supposed to make me feel better ?
You were going to set a spooky mood , Mr . Deesalinger ?
COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
That sound you're hearing is all future students saying " OH WOW HISTORY JUST GOT INTERESTING " !
What if this is the high point of my life ? What if it's all downhill from here ? ! That sucks !
My own life doesn't count , and besides I could go back in time and CHANGE things ! Like your breakfast today : wasn't it delicious ? Don't you wish you could have had that breakfast YESTERDAY ?
Batman needs the financial support of Wayne Enterprises , so he has to devote more time to it ! But every time he's in the boardroom instead of on the streets , people are DYING .
Dromiceiomimus , here's a COMPELLING IDEA for ending complacency . We'll insult each other and then become enemies , and THEN , I wouldn't have our little chats to look forward to anymore . Result : complacency : nullified !
You're good at making friends though , T - Rex ! You're not shy !
Maybe it's whoistopless @ ohheyeveryoneitsme . com , dowepartyhard @ yesthatishowweparty . net , OR imtiredofpartying @ guessimelderlynow . co . uk . Any of those are good .
Conceptual metaphors are those that allow us to understand one idea in terms of another ! They inform the language we use when talking about all sorts of concepts , and are almost subconscious .
That's that climactic slow dance from Back to the Future , right ? Why do you like it ?

To begin : my stomping on this manner is a sorted little affair ! Take soulless in the fact that at leased ewe are knot being chaste as well !
Ladies and gentlemen : the mummy's gold isn't going to rescue itself !
So it's essentially unknowable to me unless I had married at that age myself . . . Hmm . . .

Ho ho ho , I get it . No , " present " as in the gift !
Sir , calm down !
He died once !
What the heck , passwords !
But did they have The Money ? ?
No it's not !

Even better !
Our every moment could be studied , observed , and finally - understood . We wouldn't have to worry about making sense of our lives , knowing someone outside is there doing it for us , and that they have all the time in the world . A multi - generational project covering just 30 seconds of my life : how flattering ! How wonderful !
Then in a rage he stomped his right foot deep into the ground , buying it up to his waist . Then he grabbed his left foot with both hands , and screaming , tore himself in two , right up the middle . THE END .

Robyn soon discovered that anyone she took a picture of showed up as a corpse , their mouths hanging open with like , worms and junk coming out of them . Scary worms . Self - portraits , friends , pets , animals : they all showed up as dead bodies , in the same positions they were photographed in but totally dead . And really well realized , too ! You honestly couldn't tell they'd been altered . Super pro - level photo manipulation was going on here .
Did you even read the book you're plagiarizing ?
In history times it wouldn't be unusual to use the exact same technology your grandfather or even great - grandfather did ! Now I buy phones knowing they'll be obsolete within two years TOPS , and entire classes of inventions are introduced and obselete [ sic ] in a single decade ! CAR PHONES , ANYONE ? ?
Many of the classics are out of copyright , and there's more free ebooks coming out every day .

Oh God yes .

Then he has a better job , and he gets more and more satisfied with his professional life and personal life and no matter what he does things just KEEP GETTING BETTER for him . Doesn't that sound nice ?
But what if someone you know reads it ? What if your MOM reads it ?
Why's that ?
Aw , frig me ! !

And as you know , Utahraptor , fewer than four out of ten people respect my promises - - and possibly more !
Holy cow ! She will mind , T - Rex ! You are in big trouble !
oh , gosh , yes , i didn't even think things could get so stressful , but then they did ! like for example i'm worried about how i'm ever gonna make friends when i get older . when you're just a kid , you've got people in your classes to hang out with and the best part is , every year you've got new classes and that means a heck of a lot of new friends ! but when you're an adult you've got a job instead of class , and people don't normally change jobs every year from what i've seen , so maybe i'm wrong but it seems like if your old friends move away and you're not friends with the folks at work , then it might be awful hard to make new friends !
The problem with trying to achieve immortality by setting a world record is that there's always going to be someone better than you ! If I eat 50 burgers , some chump will eventually eat 51 !
But they're inventions without an inventor and you can do the same thing with works of art !
Further , T - Rex , they go on to observe that " One bad apple spreads decay to other apples stored nearby . An entire barrel can easily be ruined in this manner . "
T - REX'S RAP CAREER
Stop ! I just realized humans and dinosaurs never existed at the same time !
Wait frig I mean it's been a TINY bit too long since I've last seen him .
Featuring : corporations !
You are a good dude !
24 HOURS LATER :
" sigh "
They wanted me to buy timeshares but didn't realize that * I * cared only for lunch and the placing of lunch inside me ! !
What did Mexican theoretical physicist Miquel Albuierre discover on Hallowe'en ? Give up ? GIVE UP ? ?
My sense of self itself is nothing more than the physical state of the chemicals and neurons in my stately skull !
Try me !
Can we also all agree that if there was a superhero who could shrink really small , he should be called " The Manite " ?
My mom said " pooty poot " to me , and she didn't even use it correctly . Parents are THE WORST at slang ! PARTICULARLY at slang that " s unfamiliar to them but they make the attempt anyway because they want to reconnect with their children , who were so happy when they were younger but now seem to be turning into distant , sullen strangers .
FROM SNOW WHITE'S WICKED QUEEN .
A sandwich . . . made out of your own tears ? ?
NOTHING ! EVERYONE HAS A GREAT TIME AND TAKES SOME AMAZING PICTURES :
Yeah , it was great !
I'm sorry , but we don't think you're right for the role . We're really looking for an actor who doesn't add " friggin' " to each of his lines .
It's a force of nature . I'm actually proud of it , because most men don't know what having a mammalian menstrual cycle is like - but I do ! You know what it's like ?
Hah ! Whatevs !
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE SUPER MARIO 64 AS OLD
The Uncanny Valley is the name given to the idea that as we build robots that look more and more like real people , the more we approach a point where we all say " oh God oh God what is wrong with that robot where did it all go wrong OH GOD " .
I invented it because it sounds , as I say , exciting and full of promise ! " Let's go see a movie , Quebec style ! " Oh , wow ! what does it mean ? What's so different ? I dont know , but I'm excited to find out !
But . . . Dr . Cohen !
Dromiceiomimus ! NO WORRIES .
The worst part of this is that even COMPLAINING about the early commercialization of Christmas is pass ? . It's like airline food ! The zeitgeist has already moved on to acceptance and " their chefs do good work under difficult circumstances " and I'm left saying " Hey notice how this sucks , though ? "
Alternatively , I could have a giant fan , like the kind used in skydiving simulators , and use air to help keep the skateboarder where I want him to be .
It has been unseasonably warm SINCE the snow , as well !
But I've come up with a solution !
My comic has a slightly different ending . . . ? !
Holy crap ! How are you not acting like an adult already ? !
Ah yes , the ineffable appeal of an plastic snowman punctuating a July lawn !
WHAT KIND OF GOD
OHHH I get it now
" His tumblr played DEATH METAL " ?
SUDDENLY : REMORSE
TO TURN BACK TIME AND LIVE AGAIN WITH YOUR SWEETIE , TURN TO PANEL 6 .
Let's play 20 questions , Dromiceiomimus ! Ask me a yes - or - no question and I'll -
What about " hobby " ?
I have taken the time and considered the matter carefully and have concluded the following : yes , my idea IS awesome !
Is it true that the only questions worth asking are those that cannot be answered ?
TWO IPHONES 4 ? ?
Rad !
Your honour , if I steal , I get a few years in jail . If I murder , I get a LIFETIME in jail . But if I forget to eat for a few days or breathe for a few minutes , I DIE FOREVER ?
HELLO I SEE YOU NOTICED THIS HOUSE HAS A NAKED DINOSAUR OUT FRONT
" How useful was it , " Superman says , " if it never even noticed there were colossal robots on Mars .
WAIT ! !
Hmm . . . That eliminates Deee - Lite's " Groove Is In The Heart " , since they weren't invented like 200 years ago .
Wrapping gifts can be a complicated issue !
Neither do I ! I'm talking out of my ass here !
Fine . FINE .
Hm . . . maybe social relationships would be much easier if everyone said exactly what they were thinking !
I love in old Star Trek episodes where Spock goes around saying " computers don't make mistakes " . I love that his lines were written by someone who clearly had never touched a computer .
Yes ! I can see nothing wrong with this fantasy .
That's right , ladies ! I'm bringing back " shan't " !
which had resulted in him being put in stasis where he remained until he was discovered by Captain Kirk , which is the person this sentence is about , was talking to Spock about space .
No , I don't know that person . It's the Pope ! !
Christmas a humbug , uncle ! You don't mean that , I am sure ?
Alright ! Life itself is , what - like twenty bucks ?
But I can whisper my secrets into a hole in the ground for FREE
But Batman's going too far !
How the heck did you answer that genetics question just now ? I didn't know you knew about stuff like that !
Hallowe'en is coming up !
I can hear it too , only it's MY voice ! AND I WENT TO BED AT 9 LAST NIGHT ! I WAS TIRED , AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT I SHOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT .
Sad ? I never saw them as sad . If anything , they represent freedom , the giddy joy of flight and exploration and the promise of a better tomorrow !
Sounds like fun , guys !
Well , take all the time you need ! We'll continue this conversation when you're no longer sad !
Experimenting with wizardchondria ?
" 'Copious sounds like copulation' , ejaculated Antonio ! "
You do it every day !
To see for yourself , all you have to do is go to the Wikipedia article on evil and do the replaces there . Hah hah ! My comedy ONCE AGAIN trumps the desires of those who would seek useful information about evil !
Don't travel back in time to bother us , T - Rex !
Yes , it does .
I do !
Attention , world ! !
Everybody wants to be remarkable ! Here are some awesome ways to be remarkable :
Just tiny women !
And then Red shows up ?
This word " style " promises authenticity but delivers the cruelest of approximations . This is the same " style " you'll see in when I offer " enthusiastic - style kisses " , " food - style protein digestibles " , or when you discover your " bakery - style " buns were baked by an AUTOMATION with a CONVEYER - BELT OVEN MOUTH and PRESSURE DIAL eyes .
Hah ! " Asteroids . "
So ! Now I'm writing my book and stepping on this tiny woman . I'm kinda hungry ?
Buying land means you own the ground ! You own it so you can put a basement there . And clearly you ALSO own the space above the ground , since that's where you put your house !
Looks like this Thursday morning just got filled up ! !
Though . . . why would I be talking about this if I wasn't a pedophile ? Ah , yes .
All that means is that if you boil the story down to its most superficial aspect then , YEAH , you can connect it to " Terminator II " . But then you might as well treat EVERY story as a sequel , prequel , or rewrite of " Terminator II " !
But you didn't . . . oh well , too late .
* the end *
Why , that sentence is senseless !
To be honest , I find this whole idea kinda insulting .
Oh geez , yes ! Of course , I would be happy to help !
Exactly ! Yes !
Would you like to buy some PRECIOUS IRON , featuring nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements , Dromiceiomimus ?
Yes ! I know what that means . . .
HOT METAPHORS
What if it eats , like , garbage and dirt ?
" Don't hassle me with your guts , bro ; I can't even begin to deal with that right now ! "
My friend , I shall . Always .
I'm jealous of him because he gets to spend time with a girl that I like .
Exactly my point !
Sing the alphabet !
Can you write all movies forever please , thanks in advance ? ?
Sometimes the lights go out in a story , and you may be confused as to what your characters are doing !
Yes ! To grime and dirt !
I CREATED THE SENTENCE . IT'S FINE .
Sure thing , dude !
Aha , my friend ! That's only because this present moment is predicated on past moments being as they were .
No I don't !
Well ! What HAVE you done for me lately ?
FOR . . . FOR WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS " AWESOME REASONS "
HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS BEST

I changed my mind ; this is horrible again
I get to spend the rest of my life being in on a great joke , and knowing that after I'm dead some honest tradespeople are going to be spooked , then intrigued , then cheezed off at me !
HER DAD BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM THE VET
OMG , I would never stop reading
I've discovered how to turn most any love song into a sea shanty !
Is it creepy to try to touch a glass that you saw a celebrity has drinken from ?
There's probably more things that you can do in an airport , T - Rex !
" Five stars & # 8230 ; out of a possible FOUR ! "
Oh that is so a deal .
Dromiceiomimus is a heterosexual dude now ! I mean , like she always is ! Like HE always is !
How can you talk about vitamins when I'm having your baby ?
Well , I think memory could totally use some improvement !
friggin do it , you guys ^ tm
Listen : all I want out of life is for my bank account to have 58 , 008 dollars in it , so that when I read my statement upside down , it says " BOOBS " .
The essential problem with Superman , as a character , is that he's too powerful and incorruptible . He's a walking deus ex machina ! You give him a foe he can't beat , and all he has to do is TRY HARDER , and then he beats the guy .
Yeah , when you close your eyes they don't turn off - instead , you stare at the inside of your own eyelids ! The red colour is from the blood vessels in them .
SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO AN UPDOG DAY ?
You screw it up ?
My friend : allow me to prove it to you !
" I can work with this , " she said , smiling .
No ?
" The best part of Terminator movies are the non - robot characters who never even travel through time " - NOBODY .
I have verified by brute force that all these numbers exist AND can be written ! Don't worry , mathematicians , the whole number system has been verified secure up to 1000 . . . thanks to ME .
FINISH THE JOB
Otherwise known as NO REGRETS , BITCHES ! !
Oh dang it dang it dang it !
INCLUDING THEIR BRAIN
Incorrect , my friend !
He's nobody ! I'm better ! It says so right in the title :
many jokes begin with this line . It is called the " set - up " , and is analogous to establishing - shots in films or first paragraphs in essays .
{ { off - screen } } Hey , who put all my balls in the closet ? And then tied the closet handle shut , and then attached a note that reads " NEVER AGAIN > : | " ?
NINTENDO . I guess they got me when I was young an uncritical , but I really LIKE them , you know ? When they do well , I seriously think , " Aw , that's nice . Good for them ! "
I know ! This caused the story's rating to pause only briefly at " R " before rocketing past " X " , " XX " , and even " XXX " !
I don't think that fixed ANYTHING , man ! Things are as messed up as ever !
That sounds like a GREAT idea ! Now I'll be backing away from you with my arms held up in a " don't shoot " position .
Guess what , everyone ? My pun is still awesome !
Way ahead of you , Utahraptor ! !
Dromiceiomimus . What is an adventure but a fumbling through novelty ? And through such rites of passage , are there not guides along the way to " humor " the initiate ?
It would be like , " Hey , I wonder what's on the radio ? Oh , it's '39398 32348 59378 70636' ! "
And while doing so I totally looked into gendered nouns ! IT TURNS OUT , if you ask people who know both English and German to list the first three adjectives that come to mind when they read the English word " bridge " , they'll say things like " beautiful " , " slender " and " fragile " , and when you ask English / Spanish speakers , they'll come up with words like " big " , " strong " , and " dangerous " . And GUESS WHAT ?
. . . Spoiler Alert !
" This particular baby is definitely distinguishable from other babies ! "
Pfft . I invented that YEARS ago . THIS is Fanfic Autobio Detective Mystery With Batman Showing Up Later . Oh ! And Then He Lets Me Drive His Plane ! !
It's where all my friends pal around .
T - REX IT WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME IF YOU WEREN'T SO SASSY
Sure ! Why not , right ? And let's assume that causality and time are experienced by " humans " as linear , constantly progressing phenomena !
TOTALLY ON IT .
28 DAYS LATER :
T - REX'S PLACE 11 AM THE NEXT DAY
YOU ALWAYS HAVE SUCH NICE THINGS TO SAY , T - REX .
LET'S DO THIS
Yeah . . .
I , um - I hadn't thought of that . I was too impressed with having an actual good idea for an art project to think about " consequences " !
and WORDS
Whoah , whoah !
Airplanes can be found in many sizes : small , medium , and yes , even large ! In terms of landing one , you'll need landing gear , which can be many colours , as paint can be applied to the wheels -
And it's ALSO a sense that gets dulled when you drink , which is why you have trouble touching your nose with your eyes closed in such situations . You're forced to rely on proprioception , and with it dulled , you miss ! You poke out your eye with your hand or whatever .
And then I stuffed the body under the floorboards !
ON DISPLAY AND BEING JUDGED
Thanks for an awesome weekend , T - Rex !
You said it everyone !
You ask her about frogs , and bam ! She knows ALL ABOUT THEM . And then you ask her about trains , and she's all , " Did you mean the band ? The album ? THE BAVARIAN VILLAGE ? ? " and I'm like , " All of them , I guess ! " It's great . It's kind like dating God !
LOSERS
I don't know . . . seems to me like you are !
Don't judge me !
Maybe Dromiceiomimus is right !
Therefore , I will use deduction to determine my role and place in society .
Good morning , T - Rex !
Yes , welcome , folks from 4000 BC ! Thanks for being our ancestors !
. . . This concludes our adventure , which I have retitled " Free Will Is An Illusion and Utahraptor Has Earned My Trust " !

I suppose . I'm still not comfortable with the name !
Well , I heard that an " h " in any tattoo is short for " Hey , Ask Me About My Sexual History " , and a second " h " on the body is short for " Hey , Some Of It Is Personal Though , Okay ? "
Woo hoo !

But red is like the # 1 easiest colour to see !
Hah hah , but what if he's really dumb looking now ? Hah hah hah !
HHHHHHHHPARENTLY YOU HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR HIM
And you say NOBODY had goatees ?
Wait wait , I take it back ! ! Forget I asked anything ! Describe me that way only if you feel like it !
Thank you ! !
NO I THOUGHT YOU MEANT HARD DRUGS
Too many emails ?
- then my emotions are limited only to the crudest of feelings ! I can laugh out loud or I can roll on ( the ) floor laughing , but what if I'm chuckling ? What if I have a condescending smirk that fades into a distant smile of recognition ? What if I want to communicate the nostalgia you have for an old girlfriend when you're dating someone who's way better , but you still miss her sometimes ? IS THERE AN ACRONYM FOR THAT , INTERNET ? ?
Name 'em .

SECRET SHARING COMICS
I imagine it'd raise some issues of WHAT AWESOME THINGS MY HAND HAS BEEN UP TO !
Guys , I'm sick ! I've taken lots of sick medicine so nobody make out with me today , okay ?
And yet ?
The people standing behind me agree with me !
Excuse me , child ! Your early stages of puberty : they . . . they -
It explained why if you burned things in a jar , they would go out : the air can only hold so much phlogiston ! But it started to fall apart when people discovered that some things , like magnesium , actually gained mass when burned .
Yeah , a small hope I'll be dead and gone and remembered as " The Guy Who Was So Upset When He Lost His Queen That His Heart Stopped Beating " !
I still think that it's not half as striking as if you didn't say a particular word for a bit - say , " frig " ?

Ah . I see .
I can afford this fine just fine , but for someone who's struggling , it could mean they don't eat that week ! And if I were super loaded , fines would mean almost nothing to me I could park like a super jerk 24 / 7 ! Fines should be scaled to income .
Or just one more way sexual intimacy is commodified ?
Good question !
So ! Excuse me , please !

HILARIOUS .

Hello , and congratulations on reproducing ! Congratulations on deciding that despite the fact that there are LITERALLY seven billion people alive on the planet today , the Earth definitely needs another sentient mouth on legs running around and shoving food inside itself . Congratulations on deciding that your genes take priority and that not a single one of these seven billion people would ever be as special and unique as your little screaming baby !
Utahraptor , you're right ! I need to apologize to him right away .
Mind if I join you ?
Okay , that's a good point !
Why wouldn't he steal the two churros per hand that I'VE been carrying around with me all da -
Tabbyhanita !
What is there to say but " yes " ?
I agree , T - Rex ; I think you are to blame here .
CLEARLY .
But I've always maintained that you can't just decide to change your sexual orientation ! How can I then go ahead and try to change what turns me on ?
If nobody else will say it , I will !

Judging by their clothes , they all died centuries ago . They rattled their chains , they slammed doors , they threw plates around , but one thing they never did , Robyn noticed , is EAT . Ghosts consumed no energy , but could still haunt houses indefinitely . Robyn realized that besides being paranormal , they were paraENTROPIC : ghosts were also outside the laws of thermodynamics !

Aw dude ! You're imagining it right now ! !
Bad books ? I never thought about it .
KISS THE FIRST : one time i was SERIOUSLY kissing a lady and thought of how bad it would be if I started laughing right then , and the image of her being so PISSED at me was so funny that I laughed right into her mouth ! 16 months later , we broke up . COINCIDENCE ? ?
You know what people don't say often enough anymore ?
Woo !
EVERYONE SUCKS THE SAME .
Oh man ! Oh crap ! ! Oh crap crap crap ! I forgot about global warming AGAIN
I'm pretty sure horses CAN do that .

IN THE FUTURE , we'll solve the old problems but we'll also have new problems .
And are you a dude who wants to make wild unpredictable changes to the history of time ?
Don't sleep with someone on a regular basis . Anyway , what's new with you ? I'm talking about my nose that leaks blood .
I am a dude who adapts himself to the people around him . If I'm with party dudes , I am more likely to want to party !

If P equals NP then a whole class of problems are easily solvable ! But we've been trying to efficiently solve these problems for years , and so far : NO DICE . But if P doesn't equal NP , why haven't we been able to prove it ?
And like I said , they're fantastic , but they don't lend themselves to the smooches . Today's actors COULD yell at each other and then make out during a car chase , but they never do .
The " grey good " nightmare scenario that haunts nanotechnology may be fiction - FOR NOW ? ? - but there IS a technology that has already escaped our control and is working to reproduce itself indefinitely .

Yes , but after the credits , the original guy wakes up and says " Whew ! It was all a dream ! " Then he gets out of bed , STUBS HIS TOE , turns to the camera in terror , wide - eyed , and screams " Oh GOSSSSSH ! ! ! "

Nat was upset when told what was going on , but they reconciled quickly since Chris felt Nat's hurt just as deeply as Nat did . " Love " didn't describe their relationship . It was more like - shared personhood . A new state of being .

And don't give me that " they only make mistakes if they're programmed to " garbage . I had a computer with a faulty HDD controller , so random bits would get flipped on random files all the time .

These are symptoms ! We should be working on the causes !
I guess we'll find out what the future holds when we get there .

Dromiceiomimus , will you learn my new languages ? One makes you say the same sentence in different ways and the other's where you always have to talk about feelings .
Um , hello ? A lot of them are ! Should we be proud of our bitter jealousies ? Our murderous angers ? Our crippling shames ? ?

It's a box of Cap'n Crunch cereal , and inside the box you put a note that says " DUDES " .
What's actually happening is that Mario and Super Mario are SWITCHING PLACES . That mushroom isn't food , it's arcane magick - ancient , unknowable - that swaps whoever touches it with a larger , more powerful magical duplicate . It was originally developed by mages for use in warfare !
HISTORY'S CHUMPS
Mister , why is that man talking about when he was a kid ?
Awesome , man ! Awesome ! !
I GET JEALOUS OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
Awesomeness builds on itself . If I build a robot suit today , that's pretty awesome , but if tomorrow I change it so it can hold a sign that says " HEY GUYS LOOK WHAT I DID INSTEAD OF CHECKING MY EMAIL " , that's even more awesome .
What does the future hold for computer science ?
The what ?
T - Rex , please stop .
Do you miss being a pirate ? I miss being a pirate . We've all made some bad decisions .
Wow ! Thanks for your letter , " T " !
T - Rex , I do not celebrate this holiday ! I'm actually celebrating Act Like A Dromiceiomimus Day , which happens to fall on the same day .
And you PROMISE you won't regret this ?
T - Rex , guess what ?
Depending on repayment sch - wait oh my GOD WHAT HAPPENED ARE WE SERIOUSLY HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT GICS ? ?
Unfortunately , all the good ones are taken . Sucks to THAT !
Yep ! He wishes himself to Africa to escape !
Huh ? Oh , you're still here ! What were you saying ?
Indeed ! ! But that slang actually comes from the insurance industry : there , if a car is damaged , and the cost of repairs is greater than the TOTAL value of the vehicle , then it's said to be totalled !
Man , I wish you'd adopt MY chatting style , both style - wise AND content - wise !
Dude , we put north where it is because that's where compasses point !
So we . . . should all be doctors ?
You would , my friend ! You would indeed .
Thanks , God !
Are we still on for dinner ?
That's impossible ! You'd thirst do death in days without water .
I'm kidding ! We double checked and it turns out THE GREAT DEPRESSION NEVER HAPPENED .
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MORE HORROR ?
" I wish my brain could've been copied into a robot body with flamethrower hands . "
Why not just give the cure to all the sick people ? For free ? They're in no condition to be out racing !
Well , maybe they're friendly ! Maybe they just want to be your friend ?
Time for me to start counting my friggin' calories !
Yep ! In the form of EXTRA GENITALS .
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER :
There is a silver lining though - we are now completely in love , despite what happened !
HOWEVER , it kinda breaks down for the past . You can't go back in time and get Michelangelo to paint different ceilings , because then you've changed the future and you might not exist anymore , womp womp . So : time travel good for future tech , bad for new works from the past greats .
That's right , I said it ! Ghosts are blind !
But perhaps in this universe , different decisions were made . Choice piles upon choice , until the world is a strangely different place !
I , lovable , scaly old T - Rex am the dinosaur at the end of this comic !
Every author who has OR EVER WILL write anything is adding this singular an colossal collaborative story ! ALL LITERATURE , IN ALL LANGUAGES IS NOW FANFICTION ABOUT MY CHARACTER HIS NAME IS ANTONIO TONY ; HE FARTED THE BED .
HOW TO WIN AT CHESS
Hah ! Wow , I - I don't even know what form that would take .
MY EUPHORIA ! !
Heck , if being a responsibly and productive member of the community was as entertaining as turning on the TV and seeing Batman punch someone in the junk , I'd be all over that !
The same .
MEANWHILE , IN FAIRYTALE LAND :
I hope I never get BURIED ALIVE !
What's this : the official beer of summer ? Oh wow I can't believe a beer company went through all the red tape to get recognized by the authority governing the beverage endorsements of the very seasons themselve - -
A sentient universe - spanning computational intelligence , the ultimate end - point of evolution and the Final Mind of all creation ? ?
( That's hot ! )
LAST NIGHT :
It's probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you .
I had to pick something ! ! It's all that came to mind !
Easy ! " Too many teens on the boat " .
Aw man ! I totally clammed up in front of Dromiceiomimus !
That sounds AWESOME ; let's go eat some right now
BY GWEN STEFANI AND PHARRELL WILLIAMS
By owning land , you own a tiny slice of delicious planetary pie !
YEAH
T - Rex .
Things would be so WEIRD !
Our offspring are idiot savants who think " oh , lexical categories , I'll definitely come up with that idea ENTIRELY ALONE . Hahah oh no a poop came out , time to cry for six hours while simultaneously inventing subject - verb agreement . " And they're coming up with these thoughts WITHOUT EVEN HAVING A LANGUAGE TO THINK THEM IN .
From now on , whenever I see someone checking their cell phone , I'll assume they're receiving instructions from the sinister shadow forces that control the world .
but i promised the staff there that i'd be extra certain to return it on time !
Maybe just a little ?
I've come up with a great way to make any otherwise - flattering compliment totally creepy . It's so easy !
I don't need a laptop battery ! All I want is a spooky skull , so that when criminals break into my house , they see a grim visage of things to come .
The English language needs to evolve to keep up !
Hey , do you know how I could stop the Utahraptor from not being friends with me ?
THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT PEOPLE SAY !
Okay , I am . But it's a small hope !
And who could forget the twist ending revealed in the last sentence of the book ? " Actually , everyone in this story is a vampire ! " ?
And let's call kissing " the check to see if my lips are smushy " .
SEVEN DAYS LATER :
Molecules are super tiny , T - Rex ! You should measure yourself in bigger units .
f
Real talk ? ?
Hey T - Rex , why are you stomping that house ?
Handy in case Stupid gets mad !
Democracy ! It certainly is the best form of government !
Then it's high fives all around !
Why , we dined together just a fortnight ago , did we not ?
See , that's still basically " bitches " .
But that's kinda awful because OBVIOUSLY all the pets would want to be your favourite , and this is THEIR heaven too - so instead let's say your mind has been altered to remove favouritism and any dreams of doing things that aren't caring for long - dead pets ! But that's changing your personality which is basically the death of self , so - let's say that doesn't happen either .
HUGGA BUBBA NEVER
Dromiceiomimus ! ! That's RACISMS
well !
But then when you go back to your own time , things might have changed !
Can you believe it ?
Hah hah hah okay LEAVING FOREVER NOW
Come on , T - Rex , that's just a stupid stereotype and lame soap opera trope !
That is an INVALID RESPONSE
That is a huge loophole that ANY NUMBER of evil twins could exploit !
The first telegram sent read " WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT " : an amazingly classy message for an amazingly classy medium !
For instance : " The horse raced past the barn fell " !
Hold on . Soccer ! It's time for . . .
Here are some of the worst things I've ever done by accident ! ACCIDENT ONE : slapped someone right in the face !
I've written a draft of a new book ! The book is called , " How To Be Awesome " .
HOW TO PASS THE TURING TEST
Also mechanics aren't allowed to make mistakes either . And the police . And judges and lawmakers . And corporations . NO MORE MISTAKES , EVERYONE . It's too easy to say " It was a mistake " , and it's way too easy to say " I'm sorry " . From now on we're all going to try something a little bit harder , and we're going to call it " NOT SCREWING UP " .
I just think we're approaching a state of perpetual copyright , and that this could interfere with my bhangra remixes of pop songs .
I hate to be the one to tell you this , but - the Earth doesn't go around the sun . The Earth goes around wherever the sun was 8 minutes ago .
Have you bee talking to the Devil , T - Rex ?
Today is a good day I think for preparing a special meal !
. . . Maybe you ARE bad at idiom .
How is that psyc -
The point is , this card is to tell you that you are great .
But you don't NEED to come up with a joke or rely on entertaining violence !
Luckily , computers can solve this problem !
I'd hack it so I get mo -
SUDDENLY T - REX RECALLS ALL THE TIMES HE HAS ENJOYED PRIVATE " JUST ME " SEXY TIMES , SOME OF WHICH LASTED WELL OVER 30 SECONDS :
Dear audio diary !
Harvesting will be left as an exercise to the reader
Or maybe PEOPLE are not that great an audience !
I am Matthew Broderick : computer hacker !
My parents were only twenty when they got married . Twenty ! I was nowhere near marriage material at twenty . I was and still am a loose cannon !
We need to start recording people's middle words !
I know I do !
Sure ! You're saying " I won't tell you about MY amazing beliefs because they would completely obliterate yours ! Also : your religion is made of sand . "
Hey ! Hey , Utahraptor !
Let's assume that the physical world exists ! And let's assume what I'll call " humans " live in this actual for - real physical world .
What do we REALLY know about them ?
Oh , come on , Utahraptor get with it . The program , that is .
What is the point about worrying about the Self if the Self is in a constant state of change ?
Wait , I'm confused . Are you worried about not being rich , or about drifting to the right ?
On it !
And I want in !
And in doing so , it will remain forever fixed , for all future generations to see !
Okay guys : I've seriously got to become immortal , STAT .
And her THIRD balloon says " Also we replaced hate . . . with SNUGGLES . "
Excellent ! Shall we say , nine - ish ?
Every nation has its own flag ( all second place to the Seychelles flag , obvs ) , but it turns out every letter of the alphabet has its own flag too ! Alphabet flags , you guys !
" Maybe I'm moving between parallel universes and this is the difference between them , whaat ? "
Then I will be the first !
PERFECT .
I know secrets !
MAAAAAN
Man ! That IS an extremely practical name .
No man , this is way better : you can actually buy a flag that doesn't look like a " J " but that means " J " and fly it above your house ! Isn't that awesome ? You can spell out words with flags ! " SUP BROS " you could say , and should the bros read it they might reply " sup " . Boats use 'em for chatting each other up !
today's film :
But plant artificats as if everything's going to end tomorrow !
NO I MEAN IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY AND PUT IN YOUR ROOM
As you suspected , everyone is having anal sex except you ! !
What's the fifth word of the seventh sentence said in the fourth episode of the sixth season ?
And you're not giving it to him ?
Wow , I can really see why you'd want to talk about this for over an hour !
I'm sorry , but I don't think you'll make a very good history teacher .
Also , don't be afraid to draw backgrounds : yes they take time , but they establish where your characters are in space , and make the comic much more visually satisfying .
Dromiceiomimus !
TRUE .
WHAT'S NEXT , A NOVEL ABOUT A ROMANCE , A " ROMANCE NOVEL " IF YOU WILL ? ?
Congratulations my friend ! I am supportive of your sexual proclivities . What's Stereotypical Male Fantasy Number 2 ?
SEX IS ALL AROUND YOU !
THIS CONCLUDES ALL OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY SUMMARIZED IN TWO SENTENCES THEATRE
LATER THAT EVENING .
I mean , I GUESS ? ?
Man , why don't we give everything a sexual orientation too while we're at it ? From now on , the moon is gay ! The Earth is heteroflexible , and the moon : 100 % SUPER HOMOSEXUAL .
That's funny , because taxes were due months ago , long before you contracted amnesia .
HEY , LET'S ALL READ T - REX'S THOUGHTS !
GREETINGS T - REX ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE NEWEST ENTRY IN THE POPULAR YET CONTROVERSIAL " GRAND THEFT AUTO " SERIES OF VIDEO GAMES
The problem of course is the fianc ? , who ( as I understand it ) does not support his wife - to - be sleeping around with another man .
I am totally cool about this and have no reaction at allllLLLLLLLL I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO IT I'M SORRY BUT MARIO PARTEE YOUR NAME IS LITERALLY " MARIO PARTEE " ! !
PEOPLE WHO DATE ONLY ASIANS COMICS
IT'S AGAIN TIME FOR ROMANCE TIPS WITH T - REX
Three women ?
Except for the fact that ice cream costs more than vegetables !
Aw diggity damn ! Somehow I forgot to rinse my toothbrush after use today !
When we saw how normal peeps exposed to anonymity and an audience became TOTAL JERKWADS , scientists began to speculate what would happen if you gave someone anonymity , an audience , PLUS voluntary invisibility and FRIGGIN' FLIGHT POWERS .
Gotta go , Patrick !
T - REX WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MACBETH
T - Rex , do you . . . want some salt ?
BOOO !
Absolutely ! If I say " Hey chicks , check out my pecs " I'm addressing both the mascu - chichs and the femi - chicks ! EVERYONE'S gotta check these pecs out .
So he probably already knows they're really just the ultimate creepy voyeurs
I LIKE RANCH FLAVOUR
Looking for a pet ?
Are you serious because I'll say them more often if that's the case
Now if I'm ever accused of wrongdoing , any investigation will reveal these posts and my extreme innocence !
I call shenanigans on that ! ! What are these 10 basic stories then ?
I'VE DONE IT EIGHTY TRILLION TIMES BEFORE AND GUESS HOW MANY REGRETS I HAVE
I don't know , I just wanted to release Mary from the prison you'd built for her . Later , she finds a great partner and is super happy !
Everyone ! Be just like me !
Don't say you can't live without your air or food . Everyone has mad this joke , plus , YOU JUST TOLD EVERY MURDERER YOUR WEAKNESS . Not smart .
The " Gold Digger " one . It's about a woman who is a gold digger , and then the narrator suggests to her that maybe she's a gold digger !
" Dancing is crazy ; fun to do / Would you like to dance ? Yes , you ! "
Like chocochops ?
I was hoping for more " how to live a deep , fulfilling life in a world you feel lost in " !
PHEW , AM I RIGHT ? ?
Ah , those were the days !
It's always a cold day in mannequin land , I guess
now performed by DINOSAURS
Um , both are off - quoted sayings of the same origin ?
. . .
BECAUSE I'M STILL KINDA CHEESED ABOUT YOU TEARING APART MY 2008 COSTUME AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS I HAVE BECOME ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER AT EXPRESSING MYSELF
Oh my gosh !
You did a Ninja Turtle ! That's not even a real person , and my toes ARE rad !
Oh right , Utahraptor's having trouble with this dude he's been seeing ! I forgive his critical outburst .
" Have you considered naming the baby after me ? It's a great name ! Ha ha , etc . "
Ha ha , I was just pulling your leg . I don't actually care for beach balls .
I think there's something wrong with my pupils - since they've turned into cartoon hearts ! !
Not bad , buddy , not bad . But answer me this : WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ?
Everyone ! Check this out and I hope you haven't left your balls on the floor because after this you might trip on them . Are you ready ? ARE YOU READY TO POSSIBLY TRIP SOME BALLS ? ?
I'd love to have a sex thing named after me !
Rachel had tripped across her LATENT SUPERPOWER : being able to take manual control of any bodily process . Soon , she was stopping her heart and then starting it up again , encoding " HEY HATERS WHAT'S UP " into her blinking via slowed - down Morse Code : the works .
Okay . Chicken husbandry ITSELF was way too hard . Anyway .
First off : how much do you know about sperm ? ?
Excuse me ! Unmotivated people ? I'm T - Rex , your motivational speaker !
If I were you I'd be polite when they show up with a cake !
Sure , I'd be happy to !
What's for dinner ?
You know that story where a classy guy takes a not - so - classy lady and then makes her classy ?
24 in base 10 ACTUALLY means " two tens and four ones " , which adds up to twenty - four . But if we were counting in base 5 , for instance - where the only numbers we have are from 0 to 4 - then 24 would mean " two FIVES and four ones " - in other words , fourteen ! We call base 10 " base 10 " because every number in it can be multiplied by 10 by adding a zero to the end . In base 5 , added zeros multiply by 5 !
THEY GET CLASSIC
So I got the link you emailed me , T - Rex !
Some people who have weiners describe them as " a grower , not a show - er " . It's ALWAYS handy to have a rhyme to help you remember the properties of your own body AND / OR identity !
Oh man . What an embarrassing slip of the tongue ! I have to go now !
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME ?
Um , especially them ?
Hey T - Rex , do you want to hang out on New Year's Eve ?
You can't honestly expect to get results by walking around shouting for " fine new sexy ladies " !
I HAVE AN INQUIRY TO POSE TO YOU
I know , right ? But I totally just made it up , according to my Generative Advice Formula . And I have tons more ! Like , for a restaurant : " Customers eat what they see , but they see what they eat . "
A creation myth ! Frig !
That's pretty much it !
Yeah , but that's a relationship ! The rest of us pay STRANGERS to butcher a chicken corpse , dunking its breaded parts in oil so that we might cram its flesh inside our bodies via our mouths .
Try it out , Dromiceiomimus ! Tell me something .
Oh , sorry , I thought we were FIXING EMAIL HERE ! SORRY if I fixed it too effectively and now you never have to deal with email again ! !
Hmm . . . I guess the idea of immortality DOES clash with the scientific principles of conservation of energy .
LIFE HACKS FOR MEN
Let me guess : you disagree ?
Because when he dies , the police are going to ask " Who stands to gain ? " and now there's a giant MILLION - DOLLAR ARROW pointing right to me , signed and notarized ! Insurance policies are instant motive ! JUST ADD DEATH !
Okay , listen , you're not allowed to rewrite my stories anymore . Prostate exam jokes ? Seriously ? I stopped reading it three panels in .
I'm at an impasse ! I don't want to kill him , but I figure if I use a human trap to release him somewhere else , I'm just shifting the problem to the new dude whose kitchen he moves into .
WHY IS THE FRIEND ZONE SO HARD TO GET INTO ? ?
what the . . .
But . . . MAYBE this is something we simply can't fully diagnose with our senses - maybe it's just too subtle !
" Standard - tastic " . No , real words , like " standardized " . You know ? Or " restandardizational " . " DiDODECArestandardizational " ! Now we're moving into the realm of me being impressed : 11 syllables ! BUT DUE TO YOUR STUMBLES , I'M ONLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF ! !
Except for . . . my resolution ?
You call shenanigans ? ?
It was a century of kids outcooling their parents !
. . . I see . So if I said that nobody knows who the historical King Arthur was ?
Because that would be plagiarism , and plagiarism is wrong !
What day of the week is it ? IT'S NOT IMPORTANT , because all that matters is that today it's time for another . . .
My self - summary
I NEED THIS
Okay , seriously , though , no joking :
WARNING : THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
Some time later . . .
I believe , canonically , the minimum skill set is knowing when to hold them , as well as being aware of the proper time at which to fold them .
You achieve peace only through a sort of " giving up " of your own free will , by either deciding that the world is as God intended , or , alternatively , that He will be the one to fix it , using you as his " tools " ! Isn't this mere escapism , a hiding from the burden of personal responsibility ?
NOW IT'S FOUR
I did ! ! I'm had to read it for school I'm pretty sure .
NERDS : The 2000kcal recommended diet includes 6 ? g daily of cobalamine vitamin B12 ; a serving of our cereal meets 23 % of that standard , which rises to 33 % when 250ml of skimmed milk is added .
Can I do that ? A website just for my opinions ? Is that seriously allowed ? ?
It's worth a try ! !
Two dinosaurs would make more noise than one dinosaur .
And I think I've figured out what part of my fear is about : causation ! There's tons of mental illnesses where we can't find any reason for them to be happening and have no idea what's causing them . NOBODY KNOWS WHAT CAUSES SCHIZOPHRENIA . You can just wake up one day and say , oh damn dudes , I've got schizophrenia ! HOW IS THAT NOT TERRIFYING ?
Anyway ! It's like - broccoli or something between your teeth ? Maybe pesto ? Anyway , it's all over the place .
Alright ! I'm gonna go lie down and stare at the ceiling for a few hours , peace out everyone
. . . Don't you have , like - a job you should be at right now ?
SEE T - REX
Okay YEAH I read them ! All I'm saying is it just takes this tech to be developed ONCE , at any point in the future , and my privacy is pooched . Friggin' dudes watching me poop 20 , 000 years in the future .
" Ben Hur " ? QUICKSAND . " 12 Angry Men " ? Originally pitched as " 12 Angry Men , Angry Because of Quicksand , They're In It " . " Some Like it Hot " was initially about quicksand temperature preferences , before receiving a relatively substantial rewrite !
Yeah , but maybe if you went to less all - you - can - eat restaurants you wouldn't need to exercise so much !
Next up there's a sponsored post that says you won't believe what's blowing up Kickstater . You'll easily believe it though ; it's just a weird belt or something . Moving along . Ooh , look : another friend posted pictures of their baby even though literally everyone she knows has already seen that baby !
I concede the point easily , backstitches ! !
I have other interests beyond sex ! For example I am interested in . . .
That's tough , yet fair !
CONVINCE YOURSELF THIS IS THE TRUE ; YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS CAREER PATAH AND THIS IS ITS COST
Dude ! It's EVIDENCE .
and white
You didn't let me finish ! THEN , over me and my thumbs up , a newspaper spins toward the camera 1930s style , fills the frame , and the headline says " T - REX AWESOME , DEAD ! "
When I'm in a relationship sometimes my sweetie and I make food together , but often I'll have to go out and pay for it . Or sometimes I'll just take care of it myself . There's no shame in that !
c ) Far away !
Listen , if you want your wallet back , Dromiceiomimus left it inside your mailbox .
Maybe they're wearing their invisibility suits !
Like all my work , the exclaimation mark belongs in the title . It's that exciting a game !
So here's how to get started on eBay !
THE NEW EMOJIS THE WORLD DESPERATELY NEEDS
Now if you would kindly get off my case , I will rest it .
These still seem pretty inspired by Sherlock Holmes
I am writing a book called " Relentless Reminders of Physical Neediness : Maybe She'll Like You Now ? "
I was thinking more like Brother Entropy or Uncle Everybodydies ! You know ? " Apples are a delicious gift from Aunt Thestrongwilleattheweak . "
Before you can do anything , you are stepped upon ! You have died .
I KNOW , RIGHT ?
NO ! !
Is there no way I can pay you ?
Yeah , lots of points !
" FIFTY - TWO MOVIES IN FIFTY - TWO DAYS "
I get that a lot ! !
Indicating in writing my informed consent to being filmed just before we kiss ?
No way ! However , maybe we WILL tell them to diphthongize their highest long vowels .
Why must I be so alone ?
We are the much more sensual people .
Really , this is good news for you !
They didn't want to have to eat their food under UV lamps which " activated " it , nor did they want to give up pasta . It's crazy ! The movement started in Italy , and I believe people canonically eat pasta there all the time ! Like , even for breakfast ?
INTERNET ARGUMENT COMICS
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR ARE SUPERSPIES :
Wow ! No wonder people like capitalism so much !
Yep ! Anyway !
The idea that horses are nature's dominoes ! I had that idea like 5 years ago ! GOD TOTALLY STOLE MY IDEA AND GOT IT AS A TATTOO .
This leaves you more room for " hashtags " , like # babes , # hotbabes , and # sunmetaphors .
Ooh ! Maybe ? ?
In fact , the only fault I can find in robots is with their real life counterparts !
If honeybabe made a mistake , I might say " Honeybabe , you made a mistake ! "
Okay , what about the principle of semiconductors ?
Shoot some dudes ! !
It turns out the world is chock full of IMAGINARY INVISIBLE LINES , and if I cross some of them , NOT ONLY do become a wanted felon , but I also get to be shot and killed !
OH PHEW I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING DRUGS
Phew
There's really not much to it , huh ?
EWWWWWWWWWW ! !
I'm not one of them though .
Well clearly Newton has this thing wrapped up nicely and we're all going to remain at constant velocity until an external force acts on us because WE ALL LOVE FOLLOWING RULES .
It's like , say I tell everyone I want to be an astronaut , right ? And now it's 20 years later and I'm not an astronaut and it's some stupid " what have you done with your life " reunion and everyone's like " HEY T - REX , HOW'S THE ASTRONAUT LIFESTYLE ? IS IT - IS IT PRETTY ACHIEVEABLE ? "
The GESTURE is what's romantic : the chocolate and diamonds are just the instantiation of the gesture . Without any meaning behind it , the chocolates are just tasty times !
Man , how do you screw up " Hide and Go Seek " ?
Man ! EVERYONE has better reasons for being here than me !
Everyone lived happily ever after , except the person who instituted the " let's feed him living maidens " program , who was later fired and prosecuted .
NOTE FOR FUTURE PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THIS COMIC :
I believe this is called " having a job " !
You know , if you're taking apart the cars and selling them . OR , if they only steal vans and then write their names on them : VANdalism ? ?
Maaaaaaaan
But that's nuts ! What we have here is a crime that becomes legal IF AND ONLY IF YOU FILM THE CRIME .
There isn't first , second , third OR zeroth law of thermodynamics that I haven't broken !
. . . someone to melt his icy exterior and reveal the big furry Tony teddy - bear within !
If nobody is seen as owning a public space , then nobody is motivated to care for it , and so care falls to the government . Spaces become bland and inoffensive , due to the nature of governance ! However , if everyone owns them , then everyone can take care of them , and they can become vibrant and challenging .
Yeah , like " You must punch out a bear within three weeks of my death , or the diamonds go to some charity instead ! "
Yeah , you keep making that joke .
Oh man , let's talk about zombies ! They're the coolest by far !
Pfft .
I don't know how to " god damn " .
Yes ! Shouldn't we ? If you were a robot , wouldn't you store a copy of your blueprints and repair manual in your cyber brain somewhere ? Doesn't that just seem . . . REASONABLE ?
And when I'm hungry , you know what I do ? I walk right into a grocery store , steal a cart , fill it up with whatever foods I want , and then I FINANCIALLY COERCE their cashiers to let me leave with the goods ! Other times I barge into a diner , sit myself down , and just TELL whoever comes by what I want cooked for me . And all it costs is a little " hush money " at the end of the meal !
Hey , can we segue this into talking about disabilities ?
LATER : ALTERING UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS IS TOO HARD FOR ANYONE TO ACCOMPLISH
And he never called me again !
I'm going to ignore the symbolism of this !
Why ?
You know what . . .
Sometimes I get a little sad !
T - REX'S LIFE GOALS :
Truly impossible !
Yeah , what if we all say " He's good , but he smells funny on Tuesdays ? "
Many philosophical systems seem predicated on increasing your happiness , either of yourself , or more globally !
T - Rex , I was just noticing how spring is here , and it occurred to me that we should eat food on a beach with friends ! !
No ! And this was such a sucky one !
OKAY NOW I AM THINKING YES
Why would he be ? ? His clothing is DESIGNED to be invisible to dumb kids . Nothing about what those kids shouted surprised him !
I speak of course of my remake of Jurassic Park !
What , you're going to shoot down my idea ?
" Therefore . . . he must not have travelled that much ! I HAVE UNCOVERED A FACT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE'S LIFE ! " and then they're happy .
After days of effort , I've only invented two of them : one is " Sherlock Bones " , who I admin was PARTIALLY inspired by Sherlock , but he's a dog now . only he cant solve crimes because he's a dog . His owner puts him into dog shows and has him running around poles and stuff . You know , He's okay at it .
I am , T - Rex , and you as well , I see !
Hey , T - Rex , what are you doing here ?
They are what allow us to get along with others , and are the foundation of society !
What ? ! My gender identity isn't BORING ! !
today's technique : CLIFFHANGERS
Centaurs ! Everyone loves centaurs because they're a horse on the bottom half -
People computers would just sit there doing ray casting by hand for like two hours before saying " okay the wall you were facing has gotten slightly closer " . It's the worst .
But I do have this " internet " of which I speak !
EMBARRASING THINGS ABOUT HUMANITY
Yeah , where you REALLY want to look is beneath the ice in Greenland . Another crash there had four nuclear weapons involved , but only debris from three was recovered . There was evidence the fourth - or parts of it - had been so heated by the resulting fire that it melted down through the ice . Serial number 78252 !
Hello T - Rex
Ha ha , not counting the slang meaning of 'hitch' of course !
SUDDENLY , THIS COMIC'S PUNCHLINE , AND THAT OF THE SYNDICATED COMIC STRIP " CATHY " , ARE SWITCHED !
YES . And you can play as the parasitoidal fungus !
Utahraptor ! You realize that you just analyzed my actions today and found meaning in them ?
I join you ; this adventure was a bad idea from the start
Our first letter comes from Michael , who asks :
Perhaps ! But this problem only comes up if you're not the centre of the Universe .
I guess I just don't see what you gain by having such a list , much less a well - publicised one !
EVERYONE IS WRONG BUT ME .
Yeah , and it destroys the character ! Superman is a symbol of hope , and you have him basically standing up and shouting " HOPE IS USELESS AGAINST A SUPERIOR FOE " and then everyone Earth dies .
You know what hasn't happened in space yet ? Friggin' murder ! Nobody's been murdered in space yet !
You're saying that by building up the legend , I do a disservice to the actual libraries ? Well , I've got news for you , my friend !
Suddenly she threw up on T - Rex , over and over until he was drenched in digestive fluid !
I can totally use this to my advantage !
Is this our next linguistic battlefield ? We're still LITERALLY licking our wounds after losing the battle on " literally " not meaning " figuratively " , and now " official " is being reduced to mean " in no official capacity at all " ?
You wanna get sandwiches ?
I think what I love best about them is their aloneness : how everyone aboard was basically removing themselves from larger society , expecting to be reintegrated when they arrived & # 8212 ; and then something went catastrophically wrong ! All we can do is piece things together . Botched mutiny ? Rogue wave ? Everyone accidentally turning invisible AND mute AND ALSO incorporeal ? If you are overly credulous then it is impossible to say for sure ! !
Recent court settlements require us to inform you of a BodyPartz design flaw : a missing OralCavity surface shedding system has left TeethBits vulnerable to colonization by acid - secreting bacteria that destroy TeethBits over time .
To die , to sleep , to sleep , perchance to dream . . . Ay , there's the rub , for in that sleep of death what dreams may come , when we have shuffled off this mortal coil ?
AND MAYBE DIES ? ?
I had a really good time on the swimming trip you planned !
By rote , it seems !
Don't try to eat me , toaster !
Motorcycle enthusiasts call cars " cages " !
I took the liberty of researching the all - time bestselling books across the entire planet and SURPRISE ! They're all like , religious books !
You're assuming that no voice is better than another . But it's perfectly natural to seek variety of expression within a set format , in the arts as well as in life and society !
But my mom says I should be a witch
There are , actually !
That is just so excellent .
Still making that lousy comic ?
" If Someone Else On A Long Bus Ride Listens To This Song On Repeat Over And Over Again ( It Actually Gets Better ) "
The loser gets pregnant first ?
This is a long shot too ! We're already repeating ourselves !
That's terrible .
. . . Some people have kids ? ?
Sorry guys , those were the last !
Right , the moral of this story is " You can run away from your friggin' problems , but if they're sentient , they'll follow you ! "
Actually , it's kinda ideal for that exact situation !
Am I perhaps too comfortable , too satisfied with my life and friends and ROUTINE ? Has the warm embrace of satisfaction become the smothering kiss of COMPLACENCY ?
Today I believe in temporal presentism ! Only the objects around me are real . They exist in space , but not in time !
You're walking up to a group of strangers and saying " Hey guys , I heard there's a sweet party at my house tonight . What do you think ? Are you going to come ? Let me know in the comments ! "
MAN THAT'S A GOOD ONE
A new lunar year , and guess who's still not married ?
Hah ! Wow , that'd be awful . Well , at least we won't be around to see it , huh ?
Sleep becomes a hellish 8 hours , per night , of inescapable advertisement .
It wasn't ?
What's up T - Rex ?
I'm going to do mind - altering drugs as a science experiment , Dromiceiomimus !
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF GOOD TIMES AND FURTHER OF MY PROCURING OF BRAND - NAME POTATO CHIPS
There are plenty of websites , magazine articles and body spray ads that will reassure you that women are just conquests without agency and that they won't have sex with you unless you suggest it to them first . My advice is DIFFERENT . My advice is rooted in reality and allows for women actually wanting the intercourse sometimes !
Um , that's not actually universal , T - Rex ! " Universal " means EVERYTHING , not just Earth !
Would you say you and your girlfriends find that . . . attractive ?
Also sailors will navigate the seas based on the relative position of delicious tacos .
Daaaaaang !
Gosh but it's sometimes hard to know what the right thing to do is ! If only there were a series of rules to tell me what to do in every situation !
I really don't see why you're forcing a Game Boy into this , T - Rex !
So check it ! when we look out into space we can see galaxies and so on , and these are really far away ! And light's fast but it still takes time to reach us , so the light from distant stars we're seeing is OLD - sometimes millions , billions of years old ! When we look up into the night sky , we are literally looking into the PAST .
Both , I guess !
Rockoons were used in the '50s , dude !
And if we view an air - conditioned room as an empty space but as one half of a cyborg , then when I enter it , MY BODY is the other half . We join , marrying the machine and flesh , working together to ensure my optimal comfort !
I tripped a few stray balls
Go on , imagine it as hard as you can !
Um that's SUPER RACIST ! !
You are hit with the sinking realization that you're in a rut : everday , you do the same old things . There must be more to living than this !
THE COLOUR I WAS THINKING OF
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT :
I don't know - I don't feel qualified to have children .
Ms . Daywomen , I cannot accept you incredibly unlikely name !
That's so sad ! That's profoundly sad !
The cooperative principle is so ingrained that even when I say non sequiturs , you're looking for a way to read it under the assumption I'm cooperating .
I have gained provisional access to a shortwave radio ! Last night I was flipping around and discovered a NUMBERS STATION . Question : how excellent is that ?
Yeah , but how often do people use : ) when emailing you ?
ALL I'VE GOT TO SHOW FOR THE PAST WEEK IS A POCKET UNIVERSE I CREATED WHERE EVERYONE FINISHES EVERY SENTENCE WITH " TO THE MAX "
The story glosses over it kind quickly , like they KNOW it's nuts , but this lady - this QUEEN - has a magic mirror which , due to its magical ways , will HONESTLY ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU PUT INTO IT AS LONG AS IT RHYMES . And what does she use it for ?
I dunno why , it's kinda obvious
Thanks for the tip !
At least by rotating 180 degrees , I can correct my course to the other dentist's office !
T - Rex , this is insanely sexist !
Obviously ! That's the first thing you learn in Cloacademia
This is the theme song to Cheers , played on steel drums and - what is that , a theremin ?
LIKE
COMICS IN WHICH THE READER LACKS SUFFICIENT CONTEXT BY WHICH TO MAKE THE POINT CLEAR TO HIS OR HER SELF .
Truly outrageous !
NOT ALLOWED
Maaan , you what's sucky and dumb ? Our regular , unenhanced bodies . But you know what'd be awesome , though ?
I don't think you'd fit on a giraffe , T - Rex .
TO BE CONTINUED . . .
THANK YOU FOR COMING OVER FOR DINNER , HERE ARE REHEATABLE PIES FROM MCDONALD'S FOR DESSERT
He fills in when you're not around or when it'd be ridiculous to ask you what you thought of something . He also tells me what you want for your birthday . What's your T - Rex simulator like ?
Listen , it's good to be prepared .
And that guarantee holds no matter what strength of players I go up against . I can play two grandmasters and still win half the time ! Can YOU truly say the same thing ?
Who wants to hear RUNNER - UP hits ?
I mean honestly that's possible but on the other hand
. . . everyone ?
You were a part of that , when you were YOUNGER . Now you're old and your role is to tease kids about going back to school . Old guys jokes like " Back to PRISON , eh ? " are your new milieu !
The secret is the HANDSHAKE . If you greet all of your friends with a handshake , then , WITHOUT FAIL , people will start commenting on how classy you are !
Oh no ! Am I to be trapped in the 50s forever ?

And that is good , because there is a dinosaur at the end of this comic .
Or maybe he's travelled to the Universe of the Lesbains !
HOW TO INVENT NEW WORDS
Take that , self - aware nincompoops ! Feel the foot wrath of my feet !

No ! Don't listen to him !
ACTUALLY THEY ALL KIND OF SUCK
ROCK STAR
UM I'M SHOUTING BECAUSE I'M MAD AT MY COMPUTER
Now you know !
I said it !
It can get pretty bad and embarrassing , I gotta say !
So she kind of impressed a few people , but since there wasn't the larger cultural context for what she was showing them , all they understood was , BASICALLY , she had a flashlight . And Rachel realized she had to ration out turning her phone on , because soon the batteries would die . So she only showed it to kings and queens , who understood it as a " weird candle " . Kinda disappointing .
Some of my best friends are horses . That's why I can make horse jokes ! They know I'm just kidding . They know that when I say " why the long face " I don't actually think all horses have long faces .
Argh !
This , my friends , is awesome !
What if I worked productively and creatively towards achieving my goals today ?
" Ah , but can it withstand a scissor - kick to the noggin ? " asked the friend . " I've just come from judo class and I'm eager to share what I've learnt . " The idiotic nature of this idea went unnoticed by either party .
You say , " You can't be serious , right ? All of you ? You're kidding , right ? " but everyone just stares at you , and when you search their faces you don't even see regret in their eyes . It's just - anticipation . Desperate , you say " I'm going to close my eyes , and I'm going to count to 10 , and I'm going to let you change your mind , " but you know what will happen . When you open your eyes , feeling stupid , you're alone . Of course you're alone . Of course .
They're like - mad sicky ? They're so great that you're like " ahh , so sick ! ! " ?
But the big questions - why are we here , where are we going - these are left OPEN despite lifetimes of work being thrown at them ! I expect nothing less than total truth and civilization has given me five thousand years of LETTING ME DOWN .
A COMIC
Mostly I just insert myself into the commercials of my youth .
Do you think this might be the result of all the bad house - related karma you've earned by stomping on other people's houses every day ?
. . . TO THE FUTURE !
Global warming ! !
Man ! If there's a better two - sentence summary of BOTH Star Wars and Archie comics , I don't want to hear it !
And that's the amazing true story of how I invented my elixir , Dromiceiomimus .
That's dumb too ! The only people who do that are old people who don't want to age anymore and young people who - actually , I'm not sure if young people even do it .
T - REX SOMEHOW SETS UP JUST SUCH A CHARITY BY ACCIDENT :
Wan to help me move in to my new apartment ?
An example ! Dromiceiomimus , you've got a very pretty body !
Well if you're a local politician your odds are improved through CRONYISM , and I guess if you're last name was like , " Lakeview " , you'd have better odds too .
I - sometimes ?
I have been working on a script : a noir about a computer programmer who gets involved in a snuff film conspiracy . The title ?
But ! If directly asking them doesn't work , what about thousands and thousands of implied requests ?
IF YOU LEAVE MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IT GETS INTEREST BUT IF IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS INFLATION YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOSING MONEY PLUS YOUR INVESTMENTS COULD BE MAKING MORE ON THE STOCK MARKET
LATER : A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE ? ?
This is super concerning , Dromiceiomimus ! I've been putting poison in my mough , TWICE A DAY , and RUBBING IT AROUND . Three times a day if I''m lying to my dentist !
THAT A LOT OF DEGREES , PROBABLY IT'S PRETTY HANDY
. . . And eventually they'll think you're this really great , important guy !
Other symptoms include the skin of my back flaking off in great big sheets .
While you may have wanted a smooch just now , Dromiceiomimus , you can't have one because I'm sick ! I have a cold .
GUESS THE COUNTRY VIA THE SUMMARY OF THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM
In conclusion , cognitive linguists love conceptual metaphors because they allow us to describe direction as an intensely desirable giant bucket .
" Neaaaaaaaaat ! "
You know what's adorable ? PUPPIES . Not nimble - handed scavengers who EAT LIFE , not multi - armed sea - dwelling cannibals bringing their intellects , vast and cool and unsympathetic , wholly and singularly to bear on the problem of CREEPING ME THE HECK OUT .
Nadir .
Sure , a bunch of witnesses saw Famous Historical Figure get shot . But maybe that was his TWIN ! Maybe FHF survived and went into hiding and WALKS AMONG US STILL .
Well , that verb form is for chumps ! I said it ! That verb form is for true chumps .
But yet , I feel troubled . If I make some change in my life , what of those I leave behind ?
Why I am always late for my very important meetings ?
That includes subway poles ! !
Excellent ! Well then , come over around 8 pm tonight . It'll be SWEET LARGE , which is slang I just made up that means " a large amount of sweet " , which is still slang actually I think .
HEY T - REX YOU KINDA SHOULDN'T TEASE PEOPLE WITH TATTOOS
T - REX IS SITTING FOR HIS OFFICIAL PORTRAIT :
Female giraffes use their hooves to protect their young !
What would you like , T - Rex ?
The toxic plastics and chemicals turn into gas and go inside your lungs . . . where a tiny kid with a tiny keyboard messes with your aveoli !
" Someone had stuffed the corpse with mangas . But he wasn't a corpse when they started . "
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT SENTENCE .
But I have proof !
That's sort of cool , actually .
I don't know , Dromiceiomimus , everything seems pretty expensive to me ! It's becoming clear though that my sense of what a good deal is froze when I was about fourteen years old . Inflation since then causes my sense of being ripped off to increase daily !
It works as follows : assume it's your birthday today , Dromiceiomimus . If I were to say , " Happy birthday , Dromiceiomimus ! " that would sound normal , yes ?
I don't know !
They are baby chickens , trusting and soft . It's not a challenge !
Nope , on account of how I'm not 65 !
If this isn't the final nail in the coffin for Leibniz's " we're in the best of all possible worlds " argument I don't know what is !
I know more secrets !
We could debate it , but that might make me very sad .
You didn't because Dromecieomimus just made it up . There's no way you could mistake a hot dog for a real dog . One's delicious and the other's made of hot dog meat !
That's Newton's First Law o' Motion !

And it'd be nice to run in the air over chasms , as long as you don't look down !
Ten roasted chickens for dinner ? I believe the answer is " Heck yes ! "
Not everyone leaps from that feeling to " they've been replaced " , but some do , and that's the Capgras delusion ! There's variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced , or their shoes , or things like that .
Utahraptor ! I have an important announcement to make !
I WAS TALKING TO THE DEVIL ABOUT VIDEO GAMES UTAHRAPTOR
Wow , you really seem to care about copyright laws !
And how do you plan to accomplish this miraculous transformation ?
But that which he does not possess , well , be assured that he substitutes for it in his own mind !
If you love someone , pretend not to care so much , and then if they happen to care more than you're pretending NOT to , then it was meant to be .
I don't know - it seems like a TRULY wacky guy would just set out for adventure , planning be damned . Hey - you know what ? Let's just get up and go on an adventure , right now ! You and me !
I've decided to become the sort of person who says " you know who " in conversation .
I KNOW , I'M SORRY I'M SORRY
Listen T - Rex , are you really sure you want an Enemies List ?
What a terrible movie THAT was . I'd definitely rate it one of the Top 50 Worst Films Of All Time ! *
I'm so manly that whenever I sneeze I accidentally rip open my shirt , because all my muscles flex at once ! Sometimes I rip open my SKIN .
Computers may have quad - core processors instead of quadriceps , but to the computer scientist these " quads " are just as alluring as the muscles of any flesh Adonis !
Alternatively !
YES , OBVIOUSLY WE'D DO THAT .

Morris the tiny bug , it's been a while ! How are you ?
Then again , our actions , as a people , HAVE been responsible for untold thousands of involuntary extinctions around the world - which could all be avoided in the future by voluntarily offering ourselves up instead ! The final generation gets to spend everyone's life savings and throw a totally wicked part , and the last one out turns off the lights . The end !
Are you sure ?
How's the mouse situation ?
No , but I can truly say that I DON'T CHEAT AT CHESS .
So , if it's not the anonymity you want , why are you going to all the trouble to sneak into our houses ?
I see you in person often enough ! What do you want emails for ?
Wait actually that's a cool blog too , nevermind , SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THAT
Um , all is quiet on a dead planet and we wait for life to evolve again ? IN CONCLUSION , I rate this world - ending threat above " asteroid impact " but below " the dreamer finally awakens and says 'whoah what a crazy yet massively detailed dream' " .
That's the point - you don't want to swallow forks either ! They can PERFORATE YOUR INSIDES .
YES BUT DUE TO CONTINUED FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT I HAVE FEW REMAINING HELLBUX AND CAN ONLY AFFORD TO EMULATE CLASSIC GAMES ON MY CLASSIC COMPUTER
The best ones do !
Yes ! Maybe sometimes you don't want to throw the fact that you've found happiness in the arms of another in my face ? Maybe you need some " euphemisms " .
Aw man ! Why would I even say that ? ?
Hah hah ! That is definitely the worst poem I've heard all day .
It is without hesitation !

Ahem .
The answer is " Batman " !
Nope ! I knew one when I was a kid , but he moved away way before I ever found out about jammin' . That was in - what , grade 5 ?
Hello and welcome to Spider - Fan , the # 1 talk show for fans of Spider - Man .
# SEX
How INTERESTING .
It's true ! But on my own terms . I can't control hiccups , so it's really being remembered for something that my body's doing that's really incidental to who I am , you know ? Anyone who heard of me would know me as The Hiccup Guy , and it would overshadow anything else I did with my life .
You're certainly changing your immediate environment , but to change the nature of the fabric of space time is far beyond our technological grasp .
I hadn't even thought of that !
CRAZY
Is that true ?
The gambler's fallacy is when one assumes that a deviation from what occurs in the long term . . .
MONOPOLY AS SHE IS PLAYED

It's not you can't do both ! Learning is learning , and some ways work better for some people .

TADA ! Old life and relation - ships gone , and you can start over in comfort . If anyone recognizes you , just say you're here on business ! WOW , HAVE I TRULY MADE IT INSANELY EASY TO START A NEW LIFE ? ?
Aaaaand it's me .
Apologize
Yep ! Because any worse and it wouldn't be a world , it would just be an empty planet without suffering , and nature ABHORS an empty planet without suffering .
You're right ! !
I'm torn ! !
I'm sure he'd forgive you .
ZING
It is a problem with me !
Also : how come my bed is so cold and empty at night ?
Computers store information in binary code , which is a series of 1s and 0s !
Hey , I feel fine too ! Would you like to talk about it for a few hours because that's always a good idea ?

Hey .
Yeah , but we're not in a story , plus your AI only answers emails !
I'm a big guy , so I eat a lot - WHICH IS FINE , except that it increases the chance that I starve to death ! And if I'm smaller I eat less , but I also face jerks trying to eat me ! And if I'm a single cell , nobody's going out of their way to eat me , but I can die if the host I'm in dies or the stream drives up or whatever .
UTAHRAPTOR : A GUY WHO IS NOT HELPING RIGHT NOW
Then he smashes through a load - bearing beam at the bottom and his house collapses ! And then a spark from a broken lamp ignites the gas , and his house explodes , shooting the guy out into the sky and lighting the surrounding houses on fire . By the time the fire department arrives the entire block is aflame , and also , their fire truck is on fire . Then the fire reaches a power station , causes a cascade failure , and power goes down for the enitre country , and soon , the world !
Why do all my parties always turn into one big Oktoberfest ?
In the first formulation , yeah .
But that depends on knowledge you could never have ! It just means that you'll be paranoid you're not full potential happy with your sweetie .
My friend , I believe that counts for something ! !
Dromiceiomimus ! There's not still laws for zeppelin on the books , right ? Because nobody uses them anymore and that means you can't get in trouble , right ? ?

Hello , T - Rex !
The failure of Midas 2 ensured there would be no Midas 3 , which was a planned prequel wherein Young Midas wished everything he touched turned to ears .

In this round , you realize that your cards are actually . . . POK ? MON .

Hah ! You're not a guy who understands emotions !

HEY T - REX WHAT WAS THAT
One must always manage their anger , lest it become under - or even un - managed and therefore out of control ! But we should also remember that emotions aren't good or bad things - it's what we do with them that matters . For instance , anger can help us break things that would otherwise remain unbroken ! Like with . . .
And I realize the answer is probably 'yes' in the context of bottle combat .
Man , forget television , books , films , short films , to a lesser extent plays and other theatre , and the remaining popular media ! They have cheapened emotion by putting it on constant display .
Hey , I've got a great idea , T - Rex : let's get tattoos together !
I'll delete all my accounts ! Social media will be dead to me !
I have a new life goal : to become a hairdresser !
Pat and Alex had some sort of relationship . One time they were expressing it physically - in a remarkable way ! Their location : erotic . Upon seeing it a third party would likely say " How are they . . . wow . Just - wow . "
True ! But , we can awesome !
Well REAL TALK : odds are you're not a piano prodigy . But buck up ! You could be a prodigy in one of the TRILLIONS of things you've never tried . Plus you don't have to discover that in an old folks home : you could die without EVER finding your special talent ! !
INSPIRATION 1 : SUNSETS ?
I look forward to your signage .
Oh my gosh NO .
The stern voice of Science tells us that these Monstrosi - ties , once having exhausted the Novelty of Death - giving , simply took it as a Matter - of - Course , and paid it little Attenshon , likely dedicating the remainder of their Facu - lities towards some Conversation and Jokery .
Hey . In base pi the decimal point is called " the pi point " , which ALSO sounds like a nice bakery !
STARRING T - REX THE DINOSAUR
Also , making weird noises .
Man , that only makes me more bad - ass !
He died of yellow fever while at sea . It totally sucks , because if his yellow fever had been as big as a goat instead of microscopic , he would've killed it BY HAND and eaten it .
Now if someone says " T - Rex , I just don't like apples " , I'll say " Hey , That's RACIST . " and when they say " What ? That's not racist ! " I'll reply with " The very fact that you're denying that it's racist is EVEN MORE RACIST ! "
Amazing story , T - Rex .
Holy crap ! When did the world get so awesome ?
Anger logic's so great I kinda forget what we saw in regular logic in the first place
Easily !
But , I still think that it's true that , given a random joke from the present and one from the past , the average person will be more likely to laugh at the present joke , just because they have more context . I'm convinced present - day jokes about airplane food will fade in cultural relevance and become less funny as airplanes are replaced by HoverPants !
also your beats , if you produce them , aren't NEARLY as sick as they could be
Oh , IT'S ON !
And it was as a hospital ship that she struck a mine and sank !
Hmm . . . I guess in the case of eternal summer I could contemplate your point . . . IN A HAMMOCK ON THE BEACH WHILE SIPPING JUICE OUT OF A COCONUT SHELL ! !
Indeed I will !
Does reincarnation work on machines ?
Cute , but it avoids the central issue which is this : we all want a reality where we act on whims and have a total freedom and blow up cars for points , but can still buil a life , fall in love , and use cheat codes when things get boring .
INSPIRATION 3 : CHEESEBURGERS
You're really not ! !
I don't mean that you are literate in the sense that you've read a lot of books , or that you can bring up the perfect literary quotation to suit a given situation . I mean that your knowledge of language is sufficient to understand what I'm saying . Right now , by reading these words , you are at least getting the gist of it .
WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE : being big into my own friggin' toes
That uh , that might not be the most helpful advice T - Rex !
But , I don't !
It was only an " accident " after the fact . Before the fact , you were like , " Hey , Utahraptor , I'm going to slap you in the face . I have been planning this slap for weeks and only now does my plan reach fruition ! "
According to the calendar on my desk -
Nevermind !
It is futile to do one's best in an absurd world !
That is how it went down .
oh god i ? m dying of boredom already oh god OH GOD
WHO KNOWS ? ?
T - REX HAS A MOMENT OF EMPATHY :
Spooky !
TRIPPING BALLS I JUST FOUND OUT I HAD
Wait wait , hold up , nevermind !
If seen , " Frosty " is to be contained but not approached .
If you're pretending to be kidnapped again to get attention it's not working !
Originally , tangos involved groups of three people !
A copy of what ?
Just use it for non - proper nouns !
. . . Huh ! So the fact that there weren't ten quadrillion people 1500 years ago SCIENTIFICALLY PROVES that some of my ancestors liked sexing it up with their cousins ! !
Try Chinese eggplant , Hawaiian eggplant , Indian eggplant , Filipino eggplant , Holland eggplant , American eggplant , Japanese eggplant , Thai eggplant , Italian eggplant and if you'd rather be the ball than the boot , Sicilian eggplant . Not to mention Cambodian green giant eggplant , Loa lavender eggplant ,
Sitting still is like the # 1 Favourite Activity All - Time CHAMPION ? ?
" Undo " : most dogs can undo their last 3 choices , but with training , you can raise this number to at least 10 . This trick pairs well with " Find me and warn me " .
HEAR ME OUT . I put to you that demons are clever , and would've LONG - AGO realized that they could possess and then exorcise EACH OTHER to productive ends . Hell is therefore full of demons saying " Can I possess you real quick so I can get someone to banish me to my mom's house ? I'm already super late for dinner ; DUDE I PROMISE I'll hit you back afterwards . "
One time , two millenia ago it was pretty okay !
What I need is some cultural context , but it seems like most of that is lost . What was it like living as a teenager 40 years ago ? I have no idea ! And anyone who did know has now grown up , so they don't REALLY know either , on account of memories altering over time .
This doesn't occur to anyone though .
Again : CONGRATULATIONS .
Man , NOBODY calls me anymore
Here's what you wanna do : you wanna take the outer edge of your digestive tract and , with their consent , push it up against the entrance ( and , when they vomit , exit ) of someone else's digestive tract . Let fluid flow through that exchange . If you're cheeky , maybe push that wet , prehensile muscle out from your mouth and partially into theirs . You know - move it around a li'l .
You're so lame !
I don't feel anything different - do you ?
. . . Why take the risk ?
That is the bestselling board game on the planet , Utahraptor . What is WRONG with us ? ?
Island dwarfism is BASICALLY the best form of evolution ever .
Like what ?
Sure , but Hulk IS fueled by rage , and that can be a powerful place to speak from . While less eloquent and logical than Supes , Hulk will still be able to make the strongest appeals there are to emotion .
The problem is that we're spending longer and longer studyin . If you do a PhD , you could be 30 years old when you graduate ! And since there's so much to know about the world , people are forced to specialize . Even at 30 , there just isn't enough time to learn it all !
I think you're too late , friend ! She's been steady with Matt for months now !
as told in the 17th century
I slept in on purpose because I was afraid of facing the day , therefore I am .
There was a cop called Utahraptor who saw T - Rex and he chased him on foot . It was exciting . Where would the chase lead to now ?
Unsatisfactory ! !
Imagine the symbology if I committed suicide ?
Utahraptor , I'm SO EXCITED . I kinda want to become super rich now , because the more money I have the more AWESOME CLAUSES I can put into my will ! " Sure , you can have some money now that I'm dead . . . IF YOU KISS FIFTY DUDES IN THE NEXT THREE MINUTES , GO GO GO ! ! ! "
T - REX REMEMBER YOUR IDEA OF BEING TRAPPED IN A UNIVERSE TRAVELLING AT RELATIVISTIC SPEED
Umm . . . I guess !
In one sentence starting with " Dude " ?
However , I have studied the past 2000 years and come up with the DEFINITIVE CULTURAL low .
THAT ONE'S PRETTY FUN . YOU GET TO MAKE UP DIFFERENT MOVIE TITLES
Well ! I guess I'm not a qualified plumber after all !
Rex : Attention , any ghosts that can hear me ! I have one thing to say to you :
I PREFER TO BE SAD ALONE SO GET USED TO THAT IF WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS , SUCKERS ! !
Wow ! Can I see your pictures ?
Little lower , little slower !
Whoah ! THIS HAS NEVER BEEN SAID OF ME BEFORE .
both ; but when amongst individuals , apparently exposed to the same conditions , any very rare deviation , due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances , appears in the parent - - say , once amongst several million individuals - - and it reappears in the child , the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to a -
Aw geez
T - REX AT THIS POINT FOR YOUR BATHROOM
UTAHRAPTOR ASKS DROMICEIOMIMUS TO HELP HIM OUT BUT FAILS TO BRIEF HER PROPERLY :
ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED : TIME ON YOUR HANDS
" If there's one thing this planet needs , it's more of us running around the place ! "
How long does it take to become a master violinist ? A few weeks , maybe ? Probably it's a few weeks .
Say something better , like " I can't believe he ate the whole thing ! "
YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN BY AN UNRULY PACK OF BABOONS . YOU WIN !
Party at my house ! !
a book by t - rex
If a trends forecaster says yellow is in , then a few years later you're gonna see a lot of yellow dresses in stores and hey presto , yellow is in .
It does indeed ! It makes me want to go home and sit , alone and sober , in a darkened room .
WHILE ALSO CRAMMING CHICKEN WINGS INTO MY MOUTH
T - Rex , your new book is basically terrible !
The apathetic ARE typically underrepresented in surveys .
WHO HAS THE SICKEST BEATS ?
Or are there ?
The " dealer " is the one who has to deal with these guys . He gives each adult some cards with numbers on them - as many as they want - and so that nobody gets any confusion in their li'l heads , the numbers are printed both rightside up and upside down on each card . The stupid adults then add up their numbers !
Hey , stop opening other people's mail , T - Rex !
Leave me alone ! Leave me alone , you monsters ! !
T - Rex , do you memorize these or just make them up as you go along ?
His trade is death itself ! The only rules he respects are the rules of the street , which are quite different than the more familiar rules of the road you may already have studied ! !
[ text covered by Dromiceiomimus ]
There was a man freestyle rapping outside my window last night .
Ooh ! Ooh ! Can I be your guest for the wedding ?
Joe's probably dead now .
AND I ENVY THEM !
Well . . . what do you want me to do about it , T - Rex ?
Also , be sure not to blow your cover !
That's racist ! !
Okay , so everyone's looking for love , right ? This being the case , the smart move isn't to joint that huge amorphous crowd . The smart move is to let those suckers find you ! You need to make yourself FOUND . You need to make yourself a catch !
I FIGURE THERE ARE THREE WAYS HE CAN SHRINK .
That's right ! I said it !
The names of the comedians are like the title of that song ?
In some comics when a character is confused , rather than saying anything in particular , they just say a question mark .
Hasta la vista , tiny woman !
WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE : machines
" Driving " is a cool game to play because it requires you focus on it LITERALLY EVERY SECOND YOU'RE PLAYING , and even though a tiny mistake can kill you instantly , the game is so incredibly boring that it can ACTUALLY LULL YOU INTO SLEEP .
The differences between adults and children are many !
Shoot ! I forgot to have a shower this morning !
When you're practicing , you're more aware of what you're doing , examining your own actions actions with an eye for improvement . It's a focus one dosen't have while simply eating as a matter of routine .
Whatever man !
OHHHH
a web card
It's not gonna happen !
Let us talk today about a very important topic :
It can't compete against Utahraptor's Peerless Thinspiration Alternative !
True , but they don't all agree with each other !
Hello ! I am late for an appointment ! Also , I don't have to listen to you ! !
No deceit with me , baby ! I use the lines sincerely !
FINE . Asexual people : you should do what I do when I want someone not to like me anymore !
You'd allow bets like that , but balance it so , overall , you don't end up losing real money . The more you gamble , the better stats your characters get , and the more you play , the more chances you have to win in the casino . Both addictions encourage the other !
! !
Before I used to dread the " what are you doing with your life " question , but not anymore ! This is because I've decided what I'm doing with my life : creating SHAKESPEARE VIDEO GAMES .
I'm serious : remove your mistakes and what's left ? An overconfident person who never REALLY does anything wrong , and even when he makes mistakes he still has everything work out ever single time !
Now that that's out of the way , we can consider the real question , which is who would win in a fight : Data or Han Solo ?
Dangerous how ?
Then it's settled : I'll move to a new town , make new friends , and start a whole new identity !
- oh !
I do , yes , because I am an adult . Listen , if you ARE secretly working on a 15 , 145 page magnum opus or something , the whole point of this is you're never supposed to mention it ! Otherwise we might suspect and the surprise is RUINED .
< < quietly > > I sit in a boat until they go away
Yes ! They're CRAZY .
Have we - finally - become " too cool for school " ?
Baaaaaa
Blaming others removes suspicion from myself !
Here are some things you can say to that !
I love eating cheeseburger !
. . . Don't die ?
I have , in fact , seen far too much
But it's tonight that we're all planning to meet for dinner !
T - REX AS AN OLD MAN COMICS
SO YOU SAY HARD ICY SNOW AND AN INUIT SPEAKER SAYS THE SAME THING ONLY JUST WITH FEWER SPACES
Fairyland civil war ?
T - REX INCREDIBLY GAINS THIS POWER FOR ONE DAY ONLY ! IT & # 8217 ; S SO PLAUSIBLE
Dude ! I wasn't trying to IMPRESS her ; I was just relaying an amusing anecdote from my own recent history !
Yep . T - That's what I think !
You sure like explosions , huh ?
. . . I actually DO want that reality .
( R ) etry ,
? Cat food ?
I did !
Pretty neat ?
It turns out horses aren't the only inspiration English uses for its idioms . We also use . . . doors ?
He had no personality of his own , no opinions , no identity beyond what some scammy website trading the stolen time of strangers for some ad money told him to have . But his suggestibility did make him EXTREMELY USEFUL as an assassin , as long as you kept him away from the internet !
" If only , " Sally said , " if only I could find someone like Timmy , but less capricious . And perhaps with either more or less mammalian body hair , whichever one it is that I find most attractive . But as my fellow humans have not invented technologies to alter people's bodies and personalities to my specifications , " she sighed , " I am out of luck . "
It's SO TRUE .
WHAT HAVE I WROUGHT
That's certainly one way of looking at it , right , Dromiceiomimums ?
ANTS :
It would be a great way to be remembered every time someone puts out a fire !
I know how it ends ! EVERYBODY DIES . Amundsen makes it though , right ?
You've chosen for yourself a philosophy that justifies everything you do as good , simply because you did it ! Now tell me , how is that a useful moral and ethical system ?
Cliffhangers are when you leave things unresolved , so the audience stays . . .
She trips to the storied landmass of Australasia !
Mice ! They are the most studied animal in our time . Their genome was sequenced before ours was , and no other animal has undergone so much genetic experimentation !
And you're DRUNK !
Our next letter comes from Wendy , who writes : " Me again ! I've never been dumped : everyone loves me forever and that never changes . No question , just wanted to share ! "
weaaaaaaaak
I'm now a sex advice columnist , baby !
You can still make some awesome breads though !
WHAT'S GOING ON ? ?
Inspired by true events , yes ! !
Not vampires ! Not as long as they stay out of the sun !
THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS IS OVER . NOW IS THE TIME FOR UNBRIDLED OPTIMISM
Charles Babbage spent a lot of his time working on mechanical calculating engines !
A Nobel Prize for Excellence in the Avoidance of Frank Discussions of Feelings ? My heart has developed so many boners right now , ladies and gentlemen !
So ! Did you read my rewrite of your comic ?
Computer , freeze program .
Probably ! Because then I could do prank calls as you , Dromiceiomimus ! I could call Utahraptor as you and invite him over for dinner , and then , when he shows up for dinner , you're liable to be unprepared for company !
2 ) Parking spaces can be rare .
And did she ?
. . . yeah , me too .
There's still bad movies . Anyway , most " Worst Book Ever " lists have mainly modern entries despite THOUSANDS of years of book history .
How is your MP3 player dumb , T - Rex ?
But that's not -
When feasible , anyway . I ALSO really like it when zombies catch someone and tear them apart , and the person is all " O no , zombies ! My day is ruined ! "
Again : awesome . But the stars move over time too , right ? I could IN THEORY not be partying with robots long enough to notice that .
OH WAIT . It's me ! !
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THERE'S NO WORD FOR LOVE :
DIFFERENT WAYS TO TELL SOMEONE THEY ARE WRONG COMICS
Pfft , not really . She gets it .
Such an approach is doomed from the start . Don't you think generations of parents have tried this ? Despite their best efforts , cleaning a room is never as fun as making it messy again . And when we grow up , digging a ditch is never as fun as - I don't know , the opposite of digging a ditch .
A lot of your previous stories WERE autobiographical . " My Tiring Day " ? " A Story About Me ( At The End I Sit Down and Write The Book You're Now Reading ) " ? If I were you , I'd write my next book such that if people DID assume it was about me , it would be flattering .
MADAME KOSOVO ? ?
I have the brash enthusiasm of an amateur and the body of a tyrannosauroid !
There is only one option :
I think my favorite was the old lady with the photograph of herself .
I didn't know adjectives suffered from overflow errors ! !
But what if Chubby Man only messed with the brakes because he was trying to REPAIR them and he sucks ? ?
Is this TRULY the worst form of racism ?
Sleeping face down style ! Rubbing my eyelids with the palms of my hand style ! Glasses would interfere with BOTH these activities .
I play " Religion " !
Well - just in case !
Um , DURING OUR SUNSET YEARS ? ?
No thank you ! It was too CRAZY .
No you're not , T - Rex !
Breakfast pleasure ! Finally , I have words for that most sublime of satisfactions ! ! BREAKFAST PLEASURE . I love breakfast pleasure .
OH MAN , YES . So dramatic ! A fight across time to save all our tomorrows ! !
- - Europe : racisms ? ?
I'm serious ! The " new Lolita " has nothing to do with the old one , and nothing interesting happens except when " LoHEta " shows up , explains that he's the new manly male Lolita , and then leaves the narrative entirely .
It's a " you " that basically means " anyone but you " . So I can say " [ Exclusive ] We are going to a party ! [ Anyone but ] You should really come ! "
So what were you going to call it originally ?
$ 0 } }
Grasshopper didn't starve necessarily ! It's possible Ant gave her some food as payment because he found her dance amusing . LIKE IN CAPITALISM ? ?
Apparently what I should've said is that I'm super excited to spend YEARS working on developing the skills , funding , and personal network necessary to create this movie ? ?
What would you do with your wishes ?
An organized body !
I find that disgusting , yet can't articulate why !
OMG OMG OMG
I can never let my father , whom I have a close relationship with , know my shameful secret ! I never -
But then after a while I got tired of my new pets so I gobbled them up !
Hey , you ever notice how every relationship you'll ever have will end in a breakup , and the only way to avoid it is by someone in it dying before that can happen ?
Um - 90 minutes long ?
And I know the best comics just make it look easy and I know it's hard to get a room full of strangers to laugh , but NEVERTHELESS , I am utterly convinced that I could do it .
- okay maybe they would fight sometimes .
Only real mysteries , please !
Medusa was now the greatest biological weapon on the face of the planet . Perseus was sent to slay her and claim her head , planning to use a mirrored shield so he could avoid looking at her directly . This , of course was futile ; light does not work that way , and Medusa now had a statue of a guy looking into his shield . Realizing her own power , Medusa began keeping her eyes closed , navigating by sound and touch .
I don't know I have powers , and over and over again I stand by as everyone close to me gets injured OR WORSE in accidents I could have easily prevented , if only I knew !
grocery store
Yes sir ! We have books on many topics , here at your local library !
Yep ! I think it's amazing how we've still got this idea of the Indian that we look for . If there's no headdress we're disappointed !
I wonder , are there any universes parallel to our own ?
Does anyone truly own the internet ?
No , I don't think he has that .
Wait , " thoughtsmith " has maxed - out pretentious !
WAIT .
We , as a people , write stories EVERY DAY where crazy , impossible things happen . We don't let reality constrain us ONE FRIGGIN' BIT . And that's great ! But when it comes to CHIP FLAVOURS suddenly we're all ,
What's wrong with " He's at peace " ? It's nice .
It was , but most vellum comes from cotton now .
Lame and SEXY
Look , if you say once is enough and I say we should hear it a kabillion times , let's take the middle ground and I'll say it only half a kabillion times .
But your names' not stupid , God !
And the ancient Greeks would be TOTALLY PISSED that I just said that ! They were so angry at Herostratus - who freely admitted that he burned down A WONDER OF THE WORLD just because he wanted his name to be remembered - that they not only executed him , but they erased him from history , forbidding anyone from mentioning his name ! Under penalty of death !
Neat ! Are there other slang words that have an origin in technical writing ?
" Bicuriosity : satisfied " ? More like , " Bicuriosity : disappointed by a fumbling and frankly clumsy grope ! "
What does it mean ?
Um , whoever did it sounds handsome ?
THE MYTH OF ICARUS
We were such losers ! !
But every time I go he asks , and every time I feel like I let him down - personally , you know ? Like he has twenty kids and I'm the only one who doesn't floss and he doesn't know why .
Dromiceiomimus , I will be honest : I'm not ONE HUNDRED percent certain what Twitter does , but does this mean that you will not be please RTing ?
You can't really live your life in fear of bad things happening , my friend !
And if there's a one - to - one link between the stuff I leave behind and the person I was , can't we imagine a future in which science can be used to follow these links . . . backwards ?
In other news , I'm now also racist against that phrase !
T - REX AND FRIENDS IN : " DATES "
You're screwed up , buddy ! !
But instead of androids you'd have prospectors , and fake librarians .
Everyone ! A new dude has moved in down the street from me !
I find it encouraging when I see a bunch of bikes taking over a road and just going on their way . The noise of traffic is replaced by the softer sound of spokes and gears . It's pretty neat !
Seriously .
I'd really like to see them try !
I don't know ! I'm gonna go home and find out RIGHT NOW !
Josh Whedon ( or whatever he's calling himself this week ) totally just downloads fan fiction and says , " Eh , good enough . " That's why Willow and Tara are lesbians !
Hitler .
It was really creepy , because these women would SEEM fine , but then they'd just keep trying to get close to me , no matter what I did . They wanted to kill me !
So much information is lost !
Skin is not too itchy !
Dude , " cyborg " and " robot " are different things ! You conflated them there ! !
Okay - impress me ! Use your genius .
That bizarre thing with the Utahraptor that I don't want to talk about : all a dream !
2 years ago I went as a ninja ! That was awesome , because I got to hit people with my ninja stick !
1 ) Men stereotypically leave the toilet seat up !
Non - teens . Older non - teens , actually . Younger non - teens are called " babypants " , as they have been since time immemorial .
We can do better !
" ALSO : GET YOUR TETANUS SHOT AGAIN "
compiler error !
You dare to correct MY grammar ?
I bet it will be , assuming you don't make " super " puns the whole night long !
Apparently !
SHOCK ENDING COMICS
T - Rex , you're talking about how sensitive you are while simultaneously stomping on things !
His score doubles into the billions , the crowd looses their minds , and we cut to our last commercial .
Well THAT'S disappointing
No way dude !
OCCAM'S RAZOR COMICS
I could be telling you a story about a friggin' SPACE ASTRONAUT and you'd be all " Neato " , but if someone else starting talking about Teen Astro : Astronaut Teenager , there's no way you wouldn't listen .
AND I was the first to employ " bitches " as a generic intensifier , bitches ! !
I was his roommate .
I mean , there's no reason it couldn't be true , right ? It would just mean that Dromiceiomimus has been LIVING the friggin' DREAM while we have been sitting around , not cultivating sweet double lives .
I've made a fantastic discovery : a discovery bound to send the music theorists back to their dusty old drawing boards ! For you see . . . .
Further complications : both men look the same ! It's a little weird .
So the fries are there , drenched in gravy , and this guy has to be at least 85 years old . He looks around his table and it hasn't been set properly , so there's no utensils , no napkins . He starts eating with his hands and despite his best efforts , the gravy's getting everywhere . His hands are soaked in it . It's running down his wrists , and that's got to feel gross .
Hey , T - Rex , what are you doing up ?
In conclusion , I've never read any of the Jimmy Olsen comics , but if they don't each end with him saying " Jimmy out , fools " then our culture still has a long way to go before perfection .
This planet isn't going to be around forever !
Okay , you're posed like you're hiding your wallet from me , but I can see that your hands are empty , and there's nowhere else you could hide it .
There's a house to stomp . . .
The time machine cast a strange temporal light on Sherlock's features !
It's time for some new plasticized new slang ! Some plasticized -
That's what's so interesting ! When there's really unfair offers ( 90 / 10 , 99 / 1 ) , some players reject them anyway .
Why would you ever want to be on the cover of a magazine ?
I love you !
Oh , we did !
I don't see how !
Okay , how many ?
You're seriously going to rob me of my Comeuppance Satisfaction by admitting you were wrong before I get to point it out to you ? You're going to be That Guy ?
THE MOVIE
Additionally , -
. . . but the desires of my darker nature manifest themselves as misogyny ! Surely that must enter into your analysis !
Thunder Legs , Longnose Booty , and Ironshoes Maneheart IV .
NEXT WEEK : T - REX MEETS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL EVER IN TIME !
Exactly ! " Silly rabbit ! Intercourse is for kids . " Wow !
So if I was paralyzed from the chest down would I not feel my stress anymore ?
LATER , T - REX GETS SAD , HIS WORLD APPEARING GREY AND LIFELESS :
RIGHT . We are NOT allowed to murder him .
Nope ! Super Nintendo !
Anyway , the deal with computers is that they're better at math than you are , and we all just have to deal with that . But we're still better than computers at a few things , including : hearing a paradox without exploding , understanding this emotion called " love " , and getting a TINY bit of water on us and not breaking forever even though it was just a stupid tiny bit of water .
Strength ! 20 girlfriends !
ME NEITHER AS A FIND IT TO BE A REASONABLE FORM OF EXPRESSION
In the 1900s , people thought we could build a computer to solve all our disagreements for us ! Just feed in the facts of the dispute , and a perfectly logical solution would come out the other end !
A singularity refers to a future moment when we create artificial intelligences that are smarter than we are . It's called this because things will be so different , it's impossible to predict past it . Everything will change !
INSPIRATION 4 : CHEESEBURGERS AGAIN
And THAT'S the truth !
Today is a good day I think to find some excitement !
How come it's rude to say " Don't let the door hit you on the way out " ? Sometimes doors close quickly and end up slappin' bums ! I'd like to be able to warn friends about doors without being SASSY / SARCASTIC .
Incidentally , do you like it when people double - dip chips ? And the second dip is actually off the dip that's on YOUR chip that's already on its way to and even partially inside your mouth ? And before you answer let me say TOO LATE because I'm already introducing you to Sam ? ?
No way ! You're an adult ; you deal with this .
Why not hire voice and accent coaches , like actors do ? I don't see why the same " here's how to talk like someone you're not " lessons wouldn't apply just as well to you .
Fantastic !
Hooray for egoism !
. . . Okay so I was never even that into yoghurt in the first place but that tears it !
Hey T - Rex , quick question ! What's the coolest place to take someone on a date ?
Is this " I am techically accurate but not practical " day ?
Whoever sent this to you thinks you are great !
Solving these problems ( P ) can be accomplished in polynomial time !
Time for a severe non - penetrative blow to the head !
HALLOWE'EN 2011 :
It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor !
Or if he worked on a boat : " Ho - ho - hoist that mainsail , lads ! "
It is well - established that we are all machines that you put food in one end and ideas come out the other end !
Sheesh
I do want gravy .
THERE IS A HUMOROUS
As a noun , PERHAPS . But now it exists as a verb , too : " I bonered out of here ! I bonered out of here like a bat bonering out of boner hell . " It's
Man ! That's lame .
I LIKE YOUR FRIGGIN' HAT !
Think nothing of it !

And then they can go outside and blow up cars ?

Hah , me neither !
I've very few historian friends .
Yep ! And then they'll send you for emergency surgery . Did you know that one of peritonitis' causes is your BOWELS becoming PERFORATED so that RAW SEWAGE sloshes around in your belly ?
Yeah , but the prize isn't for being peaceful ! It's for working TOWARDS peace .
SOCIALISM COMICS !
And better than ever !
WE'RE PLAYING CHESS NOW , HATERS
" Meet cute " is the scene in the movie where your two characters come together and both spill the same flavour of nutritional smoothie on each other . ADORABLE , right ? AND an excellent foundation for a lifelong commitment !
I think if you REALLY want to show me up , your course is clear !
See what I did there ? It's like that " free Tibet with purchase of another Tibet " joke , but I'm using " purchase " in the " get a firm grip or footing " sense , so my poetry will be free verse that is solid and allows for easy understanding .
Man , my source for medical secrets won't tell me anything now , because I " broke her confidence " when I told everyone about the breathing thing !
It's a little weird !
Surely a little recognition is more than I could ever hope for !
But there was a single pa at the bottom of the stack !
I think it will be , and flattering too !
Um . . . the Mongolian horse ?
EVEN BUMS ?
It celebrates failure ?
Some of them were pretty okay , I guess .
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT AND NOT AWFUL AT ALL .
Could that happen ? !
I could and I will !
Are you looking for a Utahraptand too ?
There's so much wrong with your theory , I don't know where to start .
Compromise isn't always bad !
today's technique : FALSE DOCUMENTS
But I can assume all the other players know this too , and won't guess higher than 66 . 67 .
I KNOW IT WAS YOU WHO FARTED
. . . THE MEANING OF LIFE ? ?
When the colony boats arrived , instead of opera houses they found untamed jungle , tropical disease and venomous snakes . One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage . By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London , 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED .
That's one person keeping the whole cake ! Nice try , Utahraptor ! !
Perennial teen Archie Andres of Riverdale , USE ? ! To whom ?
It's because parents totally assume their babies are talking about them !
Really ? That's your name ? You know what : I don't think you're taking this adventure seriously . This was a trap , and you walked right into it . You , Grand Theft Zoosmell , try to make some positive life changes but you died . THE END .
I had to be careful not to let him know I'd considered this situation before .
THE STORY OF GEORGE MALLORY AND ANDREW IRVINE ( INCREDIBLE TRUE PART )
don't worry DON'T WORRY everything else is FINE
So I never really found out about mind - altering drugs . Are they a GOOD idea , or a BAD idea ?
I find that most movies need way more explosions , though .
I promise it ! !
TOLD VIA DINOSAUR PROXY
When we abandon illusions , life is revealed as nothing ! It is nothing short of absurd !
SETTLE DOWN GUYS
They'd be like superhero trading cards , with a sweet picture on the front and then facts the back . Real Name ! First Appearance ! Battles Fought ! But also STATS , so you'd know speed , stamina , intelligence , strength , agility AND durability on a scale of 1 to 7 , and you could FINALLY have an informed conversation about which god could beat up which other god !
SO UM
I suppose this legacy of sexism will be with us until we , as a people , finally return to the moon with chicks .
Now compress your greatest and most sublime ideas down to 140 characters !
Later , on a whale - watching tour :
But I don't know anything about what's going on with my body ! !
Oh , it's true ! The only viable solution is to never speak again !
" Pipes " means " muscles " , right ?
It's a shame you're not writing this down , because now it'll be lost forever .
I'd say , " That's me ! " His exploits shall be going to have been being done by me !
This is an old fact , T - Rex ! I'm barely tripping ANY balls right now .
" SANTA "
I don't know dude !
I'm not a dude who usually has dreams , but last night I dreamed I had a whole other house , had forgotten about paying the mortgage , and was now horribly in debt ?
And with my new dance moves , I " tore up the dance floor " !
You really think your body is perfect , don't you ?
I - um .
I sure did ! It's really easy to steal because you just use " Beth " where you'd otherwise use " best " .
I don't know - maybe they'll look fetching on you !
YEARS LATER , UTAHRAPTOR ONCE AGAIN REFERS TO HIS LIPS AS " LITTLE PILLOWS " :
Worst case : they wake up snuggled next to their horse by some idyllic forest stream , blinking as sunrise filters through the light morning fog and Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite # 1 , Op . 46 - 1 plays .
THE PERFECT DOG
COMICS FOR HETEROSEXUAL CHICKS AND TOTALLY GAY DUDES ! Narrator : todays comic
Hooray for Christmas !
With my nights freed up from the chore of sleep , I will become unstoppable ! I'll have an extra eight hours to plan and scheme !
For instance , you could say " I love you " , but you could also say " I really love you " ! Or , for that matter : " I really really love you ! "
T - REX HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT UTAHRAPTOR ISN'T THE TIME TRAVELLER WHO LOST THE SPARK PLUG IN THE DISTANT PAST IN THE FIRST PLACE
Then Robin's like , " My name's Dick Grayson " , and again , a secret , so keep it to yourself , and Watson's like , " That explains the DC Comics thing " and Robin smiles this crooked smile that hits Watson like a ton of bricks .
Could this task be made more , oh I don't know , XTREME ? Perhaps . . . ULTIMATE ?
So if you scream , they suspect bad - times peritonitis .
Then the spammers weaponize too , and suddenly it's an worldwide all - out war for our dreams , where the only limit is . . . OUR IMAGINATION .
Hah ! I might accuse you of that just for fun .
Yeah ? Well maybe we'll see what SHAKESPEARE has to say . . . !
HOW TO BE PATRONIZING
And then I land in a pile of trash with a banana peel on my head . And I exhale , and the banana peel over my head lifts up a bit . Then it flops down again .
THINGS TO DO WHILE WAITING IN AN AIRPORT
The T - Rex chases you . Be careful ! There is a Utahraptor here .
Oooh ! Let's ! !
I heard you were going as a witch this year
Man , that was SUPPOSED to illustrate the paradox of omnipotence !
I'm still looking for and R - Rex and an S - Rex to complete my pal set .
I checked it and it's true ! Being sad is NO LONGER IN STYLE .
" NOT SURE IF REAL LIFE " , he thought , then he imagined a picture of Fry from Futurama squinting a little , then he completed the thought with " OR A DREAM " . It was no dream . His room , a regular bedroom , only rather too small , lay quiet between the four familiar walls . He struggled to get out of bed . " AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE " he said , then pictured Lebowski with a gun , " WHO CAN'T GET OUT OF BED ? ? "
Hey I got all this food and friendship , where should we go ?
Oh my god , that's right - I've got the same problem BATMAN has ! Oh man , oh man , this is GREAT ! I've got a new understanding of Batman !
I miss the days when you could do a favour for an animal , and it would repay you with a story !
LATER : A CRITICAL MASS FOR CANNIBALS :
LATER , DISAPPOINTMENT REIGNS SUPREME :
You don't have any idea what post - communism is , do you T - Rex ?
Or , even worse , they say " Excuse me , I've got to take this " and leave the room !
Okay , but wr're just talking a few nanoseconds ! I'm not going to trip b -
What the hell , now everybody's into pretty princess courtroom romances instead ! !
STAGE 5 : EXERCISE , AT LAST , OVER
Guys , I REALLY just don't think I'm as into snowboarding as I used to be .
Hello ? !
Hah , you think I should do it ?
LAYLA , duh duh duh . . . You've got me on my KNEES , LAYLA . Duh duh duh - I'm beggin' darlin' please , LAYLA .
I was young , in primary school , and sports were a thing that I hated . Team sports , really , because - oh god , teams . Being last to be chosen was just the beginning : you knew you had an hour ahead of you playing a game where you didn't know the rules but everyone else did , an hour of not being sure who was on your team and who wasn't , an hour where the only relief was when you somehow threw the ball away in the right direction after it came to you .
T - Rex , you have to make your readers feel scared ! You just can't tell them they're scared .
WOW
Boring is a thing weekends used to be , right ?
I really don't !
Not true !
This is just because I kinda bothered him for no reason .
Man , glasses are gonna cramp my style . I'm not a glasses dude ! I'm a NON - GLASSES dude !
BAD NEWS T - REX
Delightful !
He could almost see his numerous image macros waving helplessly before his eyes !
That's right , my friend !
And that's just the stuff we know about !
Nurses ?
Oh yeah ? Well , I think that maybe your MOM has something to offer !
Ha ha , nothing of course !
While centaurs are pretty awesome , I think mermaids are better : fish bottoms , ferocious dinosaur tops !
OR MAYBE - - AND STAY WITH ME - - MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLAY VIDEO GAMES
They're just a special case of pals ! They're " pals that you can kiss and tell secrets to " .
Okay , I am writing ROMANCE here . No sex !
Apparently , dude !
MAILBAG TIME WITH T - REX !
" Air " is a good one , because then your kid can be a superspy on an underwater mission and say " Hey . Guess what ? You need Air to breathe . " and then explode the scuba gear of a bad guy .
WHATEVER , T - REX ! HERE'S ANOTHER TIME YOU WANTED TO BE CANONICALLY ADULT :
In my own life !
PAY BACK THE MONEY YOU OWE ME
Because dude , I am comin' up EMPTY HANDED over here
My politics are the right ones ANYWAYS .
You're right : there's no way that could lead to anything good .
To conclude , I hope people needed this joke explained , because otherwise I've been hardcore wasting my time today !
LATER , T - REX DOES THE SAME TRICK WITH PEOPLE USING COMPUTERS THAT HE DID WITH PEOPLE USING CELL PHONES :
You need something random . How about folks who have red hair ?
What a nice day to go out and do manly things .
We're trying to explain YOUR origin here ?
DUDE IT ? S THREESOME O ? CLOCK
Chad , is this painting of some boring field secretly an extremely challenging " Where's Waldo ? " game ?
I think you'd need more than the entire output of the sun !
To the hospital , Utahraptor ! !
You know what ?
They " do plot " ?
Rex : Where's your goatee ?
oh gee gosh mr . tusks you must have felt super duper embarrassed i mean with all the confusion over the mayorship and what - all i mean i would just have no idea what to do or say in that incredibly politically awkward situation
oh , terrific ! So the only thing to argue for consciousness is that it lets us practice intentional self harm ? YAY FOR SELF AWARENESS ? ?
How hard could it be ?
An excellent point , Dromiceiomimus !
That is certainly true !
Explain !
Stomping a few buildings and women should get his attention . . .
Oh , OK .
Which is nice
It's cordless , so it can follow me around .
YEARS LATER , T - REX IS GIVEN THE CHANCE TO GO BACK IN TIME AND CHOOSES NOT TO REVISIT THIS EXCHANGE !
I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon ! ONLY DUDES . DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN .
I still really want to be pals ! !
Nevertheless , I feel I am entitled to one !
Trrrrrrricky
Yes ! But you have to be good at them too .
Why not come onto my lawn for a second
POLTERGEISTS .
I have a friend , of my own age , who is having a relationship - the only word for it is " affair " - with a woman who is engaged to be married !
I suppose we'll all briefly find out tonight . Happy holidays , Agents , and a very merry Christmas ! !
ERROR 5000 : NOT ACTUALLY A COMPUTER , UTAHRAPTOR
Interesting !
Hello , Kelsey Grammer ?
Ho ho ! They are allowed to be teased by me whenever they use their phone , even if it's in an emergency !
Don't you get " runner's high " at the end though ?
I - I just would prefer it if you'd consider quitting the habit !
Ha ha ! Little does she know !
With the invention of the & # 8220 ; internet & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; email & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; instant messaging software & # 8221 ; , people are more social than ever & # 8211 ; and this increased chance for communication leads to better social skills ! Hooray !
No I don't ! I do it because when I write I like to steal good things ! !
But instead of cars , they'd stumble onto their horses and fall asleep at the reins instead of the wheel , and then rather than crashing into a concrete wall and dying , they'd wake up safe and sound at their houses the next morning . Because the horse was alive and could make decisions and would be all " WTF , he fell asleep ? I'm going home . WTF . "
When I say " Case closed " I make eye contact , take off my glasses , and dramatically slam closed the book I'm holding .
Somehow I thought this wouldn't be a bad idea , but I can no longer - remember how I reached that conclusion ?
OPERATION : MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY : DAY THIRTY
Yeah , an early biographer wanted to make sure history portrayed Beethoven " properly " , so he destroyed about half of them and altered the others .
Earlier today my nose was like , " Hey , T - Rex ! I'm gonna leak blood for no reason ! " and I was all " . . . Awesome ? "
The deal ?
Today's Awkward Day , eh ? God knows I've already got enough of that !
TIP : To see results from only a particular daterange , use " daterange : 20010101 - 20051231 " . Past events cannot be changed by you .
This sounds like a battery problem , T - Rex !
The question you have to ask yourself now , is which of the four walls did you break ?
You will ABSOLUTELY find a skeleton . This is the downside of Europe : all those skellies have to go somewhere , and the dead vastly outnumber the living . Have you ever seen those models of Earth where the atmosphere is just this super thin layer on top of the hulking mass of the planet ?
Yep ! Of course , all this lets us do is communicate a prime number q in secret to each other . But you can probably do even more things with trapdoor functions !
T - REX IN : " PRESENTISM "
I felt crazy when I found this out , but it LITERALLY costs the same to print " Mother died today " and " Mother died fighting the Zergon fleet commander today " . Are you talking notes Camus ? ?
YEAH MAYBE
Nothing !
Listen , JUST SO YOU KNOW , I'm doing computer science in my head right now
Good God ! What are you cephalopods doing in my bedroom ? ?
The only way this could be better is if you dated someone cool AND adult enough to tackle their feelings head on .
Awesome ! What am I getting ?
WHAT ARE ONE IN SEVEN CANADIANS UP TO ?
The instructions CAN be quite complicated
It's clearly implied that it takes place in an alternate universe where dinosaurs can talk !
Literally nothing will ever go wrong for us again !
Okay T - Rex , I'm not sure what's going on here , but without verbs we cannot run or play or smile or even be !
You'll still suffocate without air .
I know . I know ! That's what bothers me about it ! Who am I to comment on someone else's marriage ? And yet , I feel compelled to comment on tons of someone else's marriages !
It is kind of baloney that poison can b e delicious .
My , my ! Hello !
HELPFUL ONE - PANEL SUMMARY .
Well YEAH , but it's the specific nature of the improbable actions that matters ! Remember ?
. . . " Life " ? ?
NOT YET YOU ARE MAKING UP NEW RACISM
. . . Hello ?
So it's probably best they didn't name her that , huh
It turns out that you can't escape politics in the media ! Every song I hear , every book I read and every movie I see has some political agenda , even if it's just tacit support fo the dominant ideology !
Sweet ! ! I'm so doing it . I'm going home RIGHT NOW and making a website with all my awesome opinions ! It will REVOLUTIONIZE the internet !
PERFECT . Utahraptor , you know this stuff !
The cop said " hold on a second " got [ sic ] a phone engineer on the line !
I love friggin' updates ! Why doesn't my computer do everything perfectly right now ? Because if it did , I wouldn't get the joy of friggin' updating all the time !
It's not that hard , you guys !
You're crazy ! Will and Grace is terrible ! They always forget to put in jokes in their episodes ! Scrubs is comedy gold compared to Will and Grace !
Daaaaang .
Ha ha , that's OK ! While I HAVE recently gained the proportional speed and strength of a spider , not to mention my keen " spider sense " , from now on I just look out for " Number One " - that means . . . ME !
Hee ! That's too bad !
you're ruining science
T - REX THERE IS BARELY 100 YEARS OF FILM SO THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH
They'll just contest the will , T - Rex !
EXACTLY ! The greatest gift anyone could give out planet is to go back in time and teach the cavechicks and cavebros how to write .
Ah , the old " culture by association " trick !
Let's pretend the Earth is going to explode at midnight tonight !
Yep !
Oh , but I love her , my Lolita !
THIS ONE ISN'T SO FUNNY ACTUALLY
And both " dust " s are the same part of speech there , too , so you can't use word order to determine meaning !
" I - I guess he was just here to make the alternate universes look good ? "
So , hey , your euphemisms are pretty weak so far !
Man , never - mind !
I KINDA LOVE HER ? ?
LATER : T - REX AND UTAHRAPORT JUST BURY FAKE STONE SKELETONS IN THE GROUND
And another one that says " We all get to live forever now ! "
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings / That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
A MAN WALKS INTO A BAR explained
That's like solving a problem of high blood pressure by removing the heart , T - Rex !
I knew this would get your attention . Now , why did you tell me your theory in the first place ?
I see two possible solutions to your problem , T - Rex !
Especially since sound takes time to travel too !
What kind of mistakes besides the toothbrush one ?
Huh ! Is there one for , like , groups of people who draw pictures of kinky sex ?
Hello my friend ! I'm fine !
Oh , I looked at your pictures too .
WAIT , THAT MEANS SOMEHOW I'VE BECOME . . . AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PROSTITUTE ? ?
Wait , is your book an existing DB book with " Sherlock read " added every few sentences ?
I meant a better nickname !
I got that , yeah ! It seems like it would only work on a musician who's lazy though , right ? Or who's insulting you about being lazy ?
That is true ! I see no reason why we both couldn't go out and buy some women's underwear !
T - REX'S GREATEST FEAR COMICS
Yeah , at once ! It was awesome ! I have pictures !
THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL GRACES
HOLLA
I , T - Rex , am begging you not to read the next panel !
Attention , everyone : stop misusing " literally " !
What ? No , he was in pieces . His hand even landed in a spectator's lap and it was still grabby !
You know what ? Maybe I WILL take Utahraptor's extremely good advice ( not pictured ! )
LATER : NOBODY FRIGGIN' CARES ABOUT OCCAM'S RAZOR
So we all know about Medusa and how her gazed turned peeps to statue peeps and then they cut off her head . But imagine if she wasn't an only child ! IMAGINE IF SHE HAD SISTERS ? ?
I wouldn't be allowed to . But , I would get drunk once , and start asking you why it's taking you guys so long to come up with flying cars and robot suits .
You're the star of the story ! Choose from any possible ending .
I KEEP SEEING BAD MOVIES
OH MY GOD THE VIDEO GAMES WERE TOO SICK TO TAKE A BREAK FROM , AHHHHH , THE FUTURE RULES
There ! I did it again .
HEY T - REX QUICK QUESTION
Rex : Music , stand - up : ALL media ! You don't want to have kids who are nostalgic for crappy culture ! WE TRIED THAT , and you know what we got for it ? THREE Brady Bunch movies . If everyone who was gonna have a baby in the 70s just WAITED , you know , just STOPPED BEING HORNY FOR 5 MINUTES , this dystopian future could've been avoided .
T - Rex's Weight - Loss Panacea ! INSTANTEOUSLY relieves all desire for food ! no surgery ! No medicine ! NO FLIM - FLAM NOSE - STUFFING !
As you know , Dromiceiomimus , the Alcubierre drive is a construct in theoretical physics that could allow faster - than - light travel by expanding and contracting spacetime via negative mass .
" T - Rex : Like Waking Up Covered in Someone Else's Blood , But In A Good Way "
Yes , go on ?
That's right , everyone !
What if I don't live forever ? Then there would be no more T - Rex - no more me !
Go nuts , axe murderer ! This dude wants to be axe murdered so bad ! ! If he didn't , he'd stop reading riiiiight . . . now ! !
I'm talking to you from over here because you're smelly , T - Rex . I'm saying this as your friend . You smell like there was an explosion at the onion factory , and you were caught at ground zero .
Oh well ! Looks like I'm never eating any foods again ever ! !
Hey , when I decide that " cool " can only mean something chilly , you'll still shoot me with the kryptonite bullet , right ?
FUNNY 2 :
Tell them I want to talk to my grandpa
Disastrous events seem less horrible when they happen : a ) As part of an ongoing process over time . . .
WHAT ?
Who ?
'Thappens to sound weird .
True ! But I've got some angles . Like when I'm old and alone and all my friends are gone , I'll end my stories with " And everyone who witnessed THAT little incident ? DEAD . "
Hah hah hah ! !
The second law of thermodynamics : somewhat less important .
Well , I -
the end !
Exactly ! It's not like anyone else is using it !
We were playing a game ! You were SUPPOSED to say my name at the end of each sentence .
" L'esprit d'escalier " means , literally , " the wit of the staircase " !
- but what about that as applied to video games ?
Everyone ! Support the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol !
There are tons of phrases in the English language that I can never use because they've already been claimed by someone else !
My other pen names include " Mikael Crichtonne " , " Jay Deesalinger " , and " Epcot Fitzgerald " . Yeah . I do some pretty amazing work .
A MACHINE THAT MAKES PEOPLE AGE REAL FAST
I would be doomed to being a second - tier character in my own life ! No one ( including myself ) would care what I was up to , when there was someone exactly like me only he didn't get sunburns !
It's the wedding experience ! You get some single people together who think life is a race , and then you convince them THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WEDDING that the only way to avoid coming in dead last is to get married ! The result : hookups !
Did you put " proud " in air quotes ?
Wait a minute ! WAIT JUST A MINUTE .
YOU WON A PRIZE
Back to back really . These Os aren't gonna J themselves , you know ? No Os left unJ - ed over here .
If there was a time when we didn't know what organs did , wouldn't there also be a time when we didn't know how sex worked ?
Word has it right !
You know what Dromiceiomimus ? ANYONE can walk on my carpets , I seriously don't mind !
T REX , RELAX !
This somehow validates my own prejudice , mysterious stranger across the street !
God , are you the biggest nerd ?
LATER : T - REX INVENTS A LANGUAGE WHERE ALL MEANING IS ENCODED IN INTONATIONS OF " SEXUAL MATURITY HAS NOT BEEN A WALK IN THE PARK FOR ME , LADIES "
What ? ! When did you get that ?
Two birds with one stone !
So are you concerned , T - Rex , that going shopping was your default activity ?
I am excited to go play with my new pet dog !
MAN ! It almost happened just there !
They jump over you and kick you into the lava from mid - air !
HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT SPORTS
Historical non - fiction !
So it turns out that there's different kinds of love .
Hey T - Rex , what were you doing five years ago ?
NO T - REX THAT IS A BAD IDEA
I could give Dromiceiomimus my toaster !
Okay , so I did some reading into vampires . Vampires are not that awesome , but on the other hand they're actually kinda wicked awesome because they're the only fictional beings with a canonical mental disorder !
Holy crap dude ! !
That's still an identifiable group of society , T - Rex !
SO HEY T - REX YOU'VE INVENTED TWO LANGUAGES IN AS MANY DAYS
How does one write a sex scene , T - Rex ?
Okay , that IS better , but still .
Why's there no friction though ?
I described my awesome story , and yet , nobody has come to me and given me a movie deal !
All I'm saying is this : wouldn't it be great if we had a feelings washroom , where we could attend to our emotions for a couple of minutes and then COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT THEM AND GET ON WITH OUR LIVES ? The answer : oh gosh yes
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
YOU'D LOSE ONE
ESPECIALLY BUMS , when they're acting as a friction brake . I thought we covered this with your " infinite skateboard " idea ?
Another great secret is to call people " Champ " .
You didn't ! Look , it's my movie , and I'm going to put the Dromiceiomimus in the lead .
So Sherlock is as good as FIVE BILLION regular detectives . If Earth's ENTIRE POPULATION was DETECTIVES in 1987 , they'd equal ONE Sherlock Holmes .
You attractive individual .
In olden times , printing was accomplished using moveable type , which was really just metal pieces with letters and punctuation on them that you'd arrange to form your words and sentences ! So , setting up a new page was slow and expensive .
I don't -
Then there can't be sexy times at all . That's not a bad idea !
Is it my curse to ALWAYS have the best jokes ?
OH MY GOD , IS IT BRUSSELS SAMOA ? ?
It's MY choice , T - Rex !
It was great , Dromiceiomimus : a whole town that had been abandoned ! All these collapsing buildings and rusting machines . It was APOCALYPSE PORN .
Dear audio diary ! Today I learned why we measure lifetimes in years and not in " failed trips to Uranus where only corpses show up at the end " .
PERSONALLY , I think the problem is the title .
If other people want to use what's mine , they will have to get their own .
It might be cool to just watch the battle , but it ALSO might be cool to go back and cold start stepping on butterflies like CRAZY , Then come back to the present and be all , " oh snap ! My bathroom is now teal ! "
Man ! These two questions better not have the same answer ! !
But all it takes is one alien that doesn't put these limits on " up " for this to get CRAZY . The universe is ENORMOUS , and a distant someone's tiny slice of ownership could extend LIGHT YEARS wide , with all of Earth inside ! And there's got to be conflicting land claims , Utahraptor . ALIENS WILL FIGHT OVER US .
416 - 595
Attention , future generations !
IN THIS ONE MOMENT , T - REX IS PERFECTLY TORN BETWEEN WANTING TO RUSH OUT TO READ EVERY BOOK ON DRESSING WELL , AND WANTING TO GO HOME TO CRY FOR ALL THE YEARS WASTED ON A NON - JEWEL - THIEF IDENTITY :
Oh , but that's where you're wrong ! Even as we speak , listeners are inching closer to our conversation , sweat beginning to form at their brows . " What is it , " they wonder , " good . . . or bad ? " Each moment we delay . . . their anticipation grows . . . ever . . . stronger . . . .
But I also know that you can't legally choose a name with military titles or other honourifics in it . The government won't accept it !
It's not canon anymore ?
Hah ! Do trees have sexes ? ?
In the future , genetic engineering has finally achieved its ultimate goal : talking vegetables . Unfortunately , one vegetable doesn't just use its mouth for talking : it also hungers . It feeds . And it's discovered the joys of eating living flesh . This is the story of how it shares its new - found taste with the rest of the vegetable kingdom . This is the story of meat - based life brought to the brink of extinction . This is the story of . . . The Oat Meal .

" Shall I compare the to a summer's day ? "
Though I suppose in our haste to deconstruct the societal sexual roles and fantasies made tangible through the mass production of gendered costumes , we're forgetting about genderless costumes , like giant ape suits !
Wait ! ! My problem's that I'm seeing any positive effect of friendship as income , and thus everyone involved in one as compromised in a conflict of interest . I would only be happy if having friends was awful ! Thanks , rare and brilliant moments of perfect self - awareness !
VAMPIRES .
So you become a dentist ?
So it's like a reverse Segway , only the computer controls speed by moving the ground , instead of the wheels .
( Science means that not all dreams can come true ! )
T - Rex
You're a one - man party , my friend !
And arguably Manner . But by breaking them , I look for a HIDDEN meaning indicated by the flouting of the maxim ! " What is so important about your and his lips ? " I might ask myself .
HOLY CRAP . Amazing !
T - REX WAIT HOW DID YOU KNOW THOSE 2000 - YEAR - OLD ROCKS WERE CARVED BY YOU
I saw a bumper sticker yesterday that compelled me to commit " random acts of kindness " !
No , you're coming because this is a Mallet Party ! The only tool we're going to have is rubber mallets , which function as hammers , and then all of our problems are going to look like nails . Oh yes .
But is there any particular reason why someone would want to read about " Peta Parka " and " Doctor Septavius " when they could read ACTUAL comics and get characters that are figuratively and in some cases LITERALLY one better than yours ? ?
Well , okay , you don't explain how or why the woman switched sexes , and I don't get why you wrote a story where a guy who looks like you is a woman , only to basically ignore the premise . And um , the ending was among the most un - satisfying I'd ever read .
Anyway , Ryan moved to a new city this weekend . He loaded up all his books into his car , but when he arrived they were soaked !
Oh boy ! What is it ?

Okay , so it turns out that you're a guy with a sucky turn - on . This is bad , T - Rex . You need to fix this .
Quit right !
And I've accidentally wardialed my way into a secret military computer that I mistake for a game developer's machine . I believe I will play this mysterious game called " GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR "
DIFFERENT WAYS TO END A RELATIONSHIP
But - but I have low self - esteem ! Remember ? ?
Wouldn't it be totally neat if life was more like a text - based adventure game ?
T - REX AND THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR
Here are pics of me and my friends . Wait the thing said I have to fill these out ! In my bedroom you will find : UNPARALLELED PLEASURE ? ?
Aw man ! Maybe - maybe pretend you don't ?
But these robots will be cars instead of building - sized colossuses , due to economics being dumb ! !
Moms like that , right ?
We don't need it !
If you guessed " T - Rex " , you are CORRECT !
And with rotating planets , the lands they fight over are constantly shifting , which mean NON - STOP WAR FOR EARTH from a near infinite array of alien foes !
DINOSAUR COMICS STRESSFUL PROBLEM GENERATOR
I wish I knew what I touched because my hands smell friggin' awesome today !
OPERATION : MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY : DAY FOUR
Oh yeah ? MY beats are so sick doctors are naming their disease after them , because NOBODY HAS BEEN QUITE SO SICK IN QUITE THE SAME WAY BEFORE .
She was at a log stacking show and this one chick totally sucked at stacking logs , basically ?
NOW LET'S ASSUME THE WEDDING STARTS IN 30 MINUTES AND YOU'RE LOST IN A FOREST KILOMETERS AWAY
So people of all genders and orientations can say " I'd hit that " to mean " I would have sex with that " , and it's so WEIRD that we all equate sex to violence , that a pleasant sexy experience gets boiled down to " synonym for punch " . And it's not just hit ! You can get demolished in bed too !
How'd you know ?
PARALLEL UNIVERSES . Travel there and THEN go back in time , and you can mess things up as much as you want , PLUS you can give Shakey a push in another direction then you get NEW SHAKESPEARE PLAYS written at the peak of his powers . It's an infinite , inexhaustible resource of brilliant art !
That's not necessarily the case , you know .
Dude , I just predicted that in the future not everyone will want their sex recorded but some will , and many elderly people will believe teens are behaving SOMEWHAT TOO RUDELY .
Hah hah ! I am an agent of CHAOS !
OPERATION : MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY : DAY FIFTEEN
Aha ! A trick question ! For you see , I ran this exercise JUST THIS MORNING and have thus removed all flaws !
Don't what ?
Hello world ! I have the following announcements to make !
Like , LITERAL decades ? !
Maybe THESE are the spiders who thrive on stomach acid ! Maybe in a week I'll be vomiting up millions of tiny red spiders , over and over again . And maybe that won't be enough , and the rest will eat their way out , tunneling through my stomach , muscles , and finally , skin .
Well prop it up , 'cause it's gonna be blown even harder !
Buying this magazine made me feel dirty and ashamed ! Have I once again thoughtlessly aided the exploitation of our nation's topless lesbian teens ?
But here's how to do it better !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Your movie sounds awesome !
So Watson helps invent telephones , helps solve cool crimes , and then codiscovers DNA .
Hey , Dromiceiomimus ! These people in this house , you know what they're saying ?
. . . so , um , I was wondering if -
Sometime we do awful things in our lives , even if we don't know it . Sometimes the only proof that we've made mistakes - terrible mistakes the UNIVERSE ITSELF punishes us for - is that we look around and we're playing . . . Monopoly .
In fact - more like category fun ! This is going to be awesome !
Utahraptor , that is very compelling ! I have only one question : what possible threat do you think a tiger could be ?
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY ? ?
Only if they were incurably insane ! Do horses even fall over ?
VITAMIN B12
That's it ! Utahraptor ! " SERIOUSLY ? "
Sir , this is Burger King , home of the Whopper .
Okay ! But Utahraptor , what's that across the street ? A car that works on water ? ?
Utahraptor was so wrong about performative utterances yesterday !
Ah , the great Library of Alexandria ! A repository of learning founded in the 3rd century BC , this library has become a powerful symbol for knowledge .
I'm afraid your reasoning is flawed T - Rex ! Fatally flawed !
LATER : THEY DO NOT KEEP UP WITH EACH OTHER
T - REX TELL ME A SUPERMAN STORY
You might just see the hundreds of distant stars and extra - solar planets named after me , T - Rex !
IT'S WHAT WOMEN WANT
Yeah , but this isn't art ! It's tagging . It's just some dude's made up name ! Taggers are like dogs , marking their territory wherever they can , and " Zach Morris " is just a dog who likes implausible high school scenarios . Either that , I guess , or Mark - Paul Gosselaar is bored . And experimenting ?
THAT ONLY SERVE TO MAKE ME POORER
T - Rex , I -
I too think these are pretty awful .
I'm watching !
NOT ALLOWE -
Here's what : a ) They're small . B ) They have their own little internet . C ) They will readily consume monkey food ? ?
SHIIIIIIIIT
I get it !
Dromiceiomimus , I made you a card to give that guy ! The outside says " I'M NOT DUMB " and the inside says " HEY MAN , SCREW YOU "
Talking to the Devil again ?
If you do well in a presentation you were KILLING up there .
Sir , we are happy to accept " The Lady In Fur : Claws for Dismissal " for publication .
Personally , I rely on my rugged physique and piercing orange eyes ( in which , because they are so deep and soulful , one feels they could drown ) , coupled with my delightful conversational skills and coquettish flair !
Just avoid the sarcastic phrasing !
That would be one tough dude ! I would rate him , " Super Manly " .
Nevertheless , her selfless actions stopped the gold market from collapse , saving her country from an economic catastrophe and decades - long recession . She is remembered today as a great woman and an early proponent of the scientific method .
I'M HAPPY IF THERE'S A SILENCE BETWEEN US
Aww ! That's kind of sad , T - rex . What if someone give you a so - bad - they're - good valentine , like those little ones with pictures of cars that say things like " I wheelie like you " ? Would you really want to turn those down ?
IF YOU SLOW DOWN A PLANET'S ORBIT IT DOESN'T STAY IN THE SAME ORBIT
Utahraptor , PLEASE . Are our heroes MALADJUSTED CHILDREN ? Do these fully - grown adults resolve their conflicts by PUNCHING whoever they disagree with ? Come on . They're better than that . WE'RE better than that .
There's a boxing kangaroo at the circus !
He said it to his dog because snowbody loved him . He had snow friends !
Wait , did you check the cupboard above the fridge ? I usually keep some cups there .
SAVE IT FOR THE POCKET UNIVERSE MAN
Hard !
Wow . Look at all those cannibals on bikes !
I'm leaving you !
Well , not exactly . Life here is 4 billion years old , remember , so older forms of life have been here before . 16 times before , actually .
SOON , T - REX TELLS UTAHRAPTOR THE STORY AND UTAHRAPTOR RESPECTS HIS WISHES FOR PRIVACY ! WHAT A SATISFYING ENDING .
What problem is that , T - Rex ?
And yet , my mighty heart is troubled .
A NEW DAY DAWNS . . .
The food actually tastes kinda good too ! I mean , like , some of it !
That is the only sentence someone whose mind is broken can say .
Aw , damn it .
No , now you're just holding them out . Let them hang limply at your side , I guess ? Man . What DO we do with our hands when we're not staring at them ?
Huh . I don't know who else it could be .
For example , Cinderella is exactly as it was before , only now Prince Charming has access to an advanced computer SO AMAZING that parts of it can exist only in hyperspace !
Every book is written by an author .
back where
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW T - REX BECAUSE I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
Hello and welcome to Today We Are Making A Food ! Today's food is " Meat Lasagna " . To start , you'll need four haploid female reproductive gametes !
Yep , it's sentences like that that make me think you maybe SHOULDN'T tell folks where your ideas come from .
Holy smokes , that was beautiful ! I -
Well , I can't say that I follow you T - Rex
Well , I'M going because it's there AND to prove that there's no murderer called the Everest Eliminator at the top .
All we need to do is figure out how to get living tissue to talk to cold heartly metal and we are SET . Giant metal arms , here I come !
The people standing behind you agree with me as well !
HOW TO WIN ARGUMENTS
But there is a LIFE HACK you can use to speed up ANY computer , even the crappy one you were going to give your grandmother . First , you start your computer on the problem . Then , you blast off and orbit a black hole at nearly the speed of light ! There are many benefits to this , such as undergoing " time dilation " , where time for you passes much slower compared to time for your grandmother who got stuck with your crappy laptop !
when will we pick up the phone to talk about this rather than going through publishing companies , is my question
Save us ! Save us from the zombie butterflies !
Peace on Earth !
HA HA
ISN'T THAT BETTER ? ?
Oh my goodness ! He was right !
FROM NOW ON , " judging others " will be known as " J . O . " , or " J - ing O " !
And it's named after the Marquis de Sade !
Attention , everyone ! ! That was pretty much all I had to say , actually
Look , it's just weird that we're food is all . Especially when we CONSUME OUR OWN BODIES to help them grow !
It's awesome ! It was about a dog who didn't have super powers , and then one day , he got some super powers .
Come on , man !
The other reason is that I know this guy with a fallout shelter , so I'm giving him the paintings . That way , in the case of NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE , future remnants of civilization may have only my paintings to go off of .
woah dude , did you forget to keep your head screwed tight ?
Do you have a garden , Dromiceiomimus ?
Pretty heady stuff !
HOW'S YOUR BODY IMAGE ?
Then I'll be able to walk up to his friends and insult them ! They'll think it's he who is the one who is insulting them ! I could wear this costume ALL THE TIME .
NO I MEAN LIKE DO YOU EVER WISH YOUR BODY LOOKED DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES
I am a sensible guy who does sensible things . My favourite expression is " Fellows ! Let us be SENSIBLE . " However !
Ooh ! OR , I could surround myself with attractive and sexually - available women and then try not to have the intercourse with them !
Still not really sold on Canada here , dude !
OR MAYBE WE ALL THINK THERE'S A NEW VIDEO GAME OUT WHERE YOU CAN RAMP A HORSE OFF A ROOF AND THEN THE HORSE LANDS ON A PLANE AND PUNCHES ENOUGH THAT SHE TAKES OVER THE PLANE
I - okay ? !
But I'm not perfect either ! Hmm . . .
That's WEIRD , you guys !
Oh , same old , same old ! " The good ol' bathroom sink " , you know ? Good ol' reliable whitey !
Jim had become the person clickbait headline writers think we ALL are !
Oh , I know ! I know . I just feel a little left out when everyone gets to have nightmares but me ! I feel . . . I feel like the only girl in grade 8 that hasn't hit puberty yet .
What would be the best thing for me to do tonight ? As I see it , I could do the dishes , or I could mop the floors , or I GUESS that I could invent an elixir that gives me the strength of twenty men .
A chilling tale , warning us all of the dangers of altering nucleonic binding force constants ! !
" Hi T - Rex ! What do ghosts like to eat ? ! "
WELL I KNOW EXACTLY 217 PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING TO SNIFF THEIR OWN POO AND CLAIM IT WAS AN " ACCIDENT "
Esquire !
" tie the knot "
With that in mind , I now present more " euphemisms " to allow you to get by in society !
Love isn't allowed because it's TOO OBVIOUS . What's the strongest non - love emotion , Dromiceiomimus ?
For the purposes of this experiment , yes . We are rhetorical sweeties !
THAT AFTERNOON :
Off improving myself !
{ { thought bubble } } It's a very competitive business .
Kilosexual :
But - you couldn't get a job at a library , bceause you wouldn't ACTUALLY know library science .
" Wow , that's very good for a first try ! "
Want to go to the cinema , son ? " The Mark of Zorro " is playing !
Although , I do like the thought process that ended with " if an ACTUAL GOD EATS HIS LIMBS , this will solve my problem " .
I'm not your boy .
So improbable , in fact , that I have no idea of how I would accomplish it . Ah well ! SO MUCH FOR VISIONS OF TOMORROW .
Oh my goodness , is my absolute favourite weather TRULY the high winds just before a storm ?
zero zero zero zero zero zero
Guys ! ! Nobody but the guy who did it could make such puns !
Que - ball !
Now that you mention it , YES I WILL .
Plus she's flunking Business Ethics !
YEAH BASICALLY YOU DIE OF SYPHILIS AT 30 BUT YOU LEAVE THIS TOTALLY HAIRY CORPSE
OH DANG , there totally was ! Hah hah hah !
There comes a time in each dinosaur's life when he or she must look him or herself in his or her mirror and -
? when he first realized he couldn't live without this woman .
Do you ever wonder if we experience the world in fundamentally different ways ?
That any one of my friends could die without a moment's notice ? Oh , thanks , I feel way better now !
Well I guess I'll see you there tonight , punch in hand .
Dude I just wanna smooch on a pretty face
It occurs to me . . .
Let's suppose we all have cows ! Ladies and gentlemen : this is totally awesome .
NO ! You'll never get away with this !
I know ! Who knew ?
No , maybe he's just a guy who dresses well and speaks many languages . A well - educated , confident man . You know . . . THE KIND OF GUY YOU WISH YOU WERE ? ?
Then let's go ! I'll meet you in the third row !
zero
That wasn't an option .
Yes ! I knew you'd figure this out ! You know what's going on with probability 0 . 9 .
I ALSO believe all conflicts are solvable through communication , peace is attainable , and that love is a gift that cannot be commodified !
I have a machine in my possession that can turn some of the most common types of matter into EDIBLE FOOD - almost indefinitely !
Two dinosaurs !
And you're hoping to avoid this by having Life Goals ?
We don't need Professor Science at all anymore !
TWO WAYS TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS
So after this dramatic montage we're on the bridge , where the Captain is !
THINGS T - REX HAS DESCRIBED AS " NEAT " : AGE 8 : NINJA TURTLES
Besides , it wasn't like those brothers were going to smash THEMSELVES , you know ?
You've never been ?
Oh ! And there's " call - in shows " ! Near as I can tell , that's where you compete with other radio owners tor ead out the stupidest YouTube comments you've ever seen .
What ? I bet you read just one fantasy book and it happened to have a boring horse that talked about feelings , T - Rex .
print and save , but do not read until you need to know about landing airplanes like RIGHT THIS SECOND
Mallory's body was found 75 years later , but no cameras were on him . Irvine's body is still up there somewhere , maybe with the cameras !
I KNOW , right ? ?
Subtitled " Are You Doing Anything Tonight ? Me , Oh , I'm Just Writing Fanfiction About Myself So , Um , I'm Pretty Much Free "
. . . they find the Soviets are already in orbit , waiting for them !
T - REX LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A GIANT HEAP OF SAND AND I REMOVE ONE GRAIN AT A TIME
This is actually an awesome premise : the air nearly opaque with dead insects !
Not just that ! You're walking , talking , AND breathing at the same time too !
Nowhere , dear friend ! I am off to & # 8211 ; go sit and & # 8211 ; read a book . About & # 8230 ; famous deserts of the past !
Hello ! Do you want to find someone to commit to and share THE ENTIRE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH ? Because you don't have to ! You can just have fun sex with each other and that's it !
oh no
Well , sure ! It would be harder to hear my accent , however , if our conversation were relayed in a text - based medium .
Well , you're making people happy , and that's something , right ?
You didn't notice .
OKAY DONE .
Haha wow
That's what we have doctors for , T - Rex ! They let us know our problems for money !
Canada
This is crazy ! You can't just pluck an emotion out of the psyche , and we don't have technology that even approaches this . When did you ever think you were going to do this ?
UTAHRAPTOR IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE PRETENDING TO BE GOD
Whooo !
Let's do that again sometime !
Did you know that you can now get digital prints for only 29 cents ? This will change the world !
Dromiceiomimus , you gotta help me . I need a creation myth !
THAT EVENING , TAKING A SHOWER :
Once upon a time there was a SERIOUSLY spooky ghost !
We tried to warn you ! We , your other friends , tried to warn you that you had been drinking , but now our mutual friend is dead , BECAUSE OF YOU ! We can't be friends anymore .
And as nobody wants to touch a human dude's raw nasty poops , no actual research into this area has ever been done .
Many things were more primitive . All of the modern conveniences you take for granted did not exist !
MOST OF THEM ARE TRAPPED IN THE PAST THOUGH , SO NO WORRIES !
5 ) Criminal Vampirism
Perhaps I'm an undiscovered artist , then !
GUESS THE NATIONAL ANIMAL OF THE COUNTRY , GIVEN A DESCRIPTION OF THE ANIMAL
Two sentient life forms enter the ring - one of them leaves !
Actually , that's a pretty sweet epitaph .
LATER , T - REX GETS A VISION OF HIS FUTURE THANKS TO THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME :
No , it'll be great ! Do me first .
Perhaps literally ! !
No , seriously ! Because -
Because i will have eaten them !
So doubt's important to foreshadowing ?
How can a one - day - old holiday have a true spirit ?
Eavesdropping teens .
In Soviet Russia , inanimate objects step on you !
" Iamhun " . . . ?
THE NEXT DAY
WELL ! I'd imagine they'd make small talk about their shared interests .
Um , SUPERMAN'S punched a criminal so hard they flew up into the sky and landed in jail ? ?
Dromiceiomimus , pick a color between ultramarine and puce !
And it turns out there's another team of campers just two hops away . You're trapped together , so you start moving towards each other . Maybe you can help each other escape ! But every time - EVERY TIME - when you reach each other , someone decides " screw working together ! " and instead STRAIGHT UP MURDERS A DUDE .
cut and save !
Okay , so give me a better one !
MEANWHILE , IN THE CHILLING " HUNGER UNIVERSE " :
The answer is " I say , most certainly ! "
He's a rhetorical dude !
Guys ! I'm right here !
It sure is convenient that I have a vehicle that brings me places without breaking down ! I sure I'm glad I don't have to worry about being stranded on the side of the road in the middle of - -
HAVING SEX ISN'T A COMPETITION AND EVEN IF IT WAS , I SAID * OVER * FIVE BABIES ! ! OVER FIVE ! THERE ARE LIKE A ZILLION NUMBERS GREATER THAN FIVE , DUDE ! !
BUT THAT NIGHT :
You'll still get way chubbs from eating CHILLY CREAM for every meal , even with carrots crammed into it !
I wonder what it's like to break up with somebody over the phone . There's only one way to find out !
" They've really demonstrated the value of teamwork . "
I have cooked up the best pizza ever . It is my pi ? ce de r ? sistance !
You'll notice that one of my nipples is highlighted in several of the pictures !
So , throughout time , people have spent their youth learning , and the time after that applying what they've learned . Not a bad system !
A paradox !
DROMICEIOMIMUS'S CANDIDATE :
God , where the heck are my socks ? ! I can't find any of my socks .
. . . Because when it comes to T - Rex facts , I've TOTALLY got your back ?
I'd love being a father , I think , but I'll probably just end up as that crazy uncle who comes to visit and secretly teaches everybody else's kids how to put too many bananas in their mouth . Ah well ! It's a good life , if you don't weaken .
I wonder what the longest word in the dictionary is !
Sometimes ! Only when I do the dishes . It's just because the counters at my house are designed for " norms " , so I have to bend over to wash things in the sink !
PS : Conan Doyle said everything was canon so y'all gotta deal with this ! PEACE
I'm unemployed !
Hello , son ! You look a little upset ! Is there maybe something personal you want to tell me ?
I was gonna go with " Mourning Sickness " because of the whole zombie / disease thing but yeah that's way better ! !
You seem awfully cheerful about all this !
He would've been a pretty regular dude , but he was a MOST irregular frog !
But the number of people who would be interested in this is small , is it not ? Small enough to be limited entirely to yourself ?
Well , I agree , but I think you're confusing cause and effect ! As things become more prominent , they move to become words . Like " electronic mail " becoming " e - mail " and finally " email " - that was due to email becoming more popular , not because people were creating the word in order to MAKE IT more popular . You know ?
I'm getting pretty sick of nostalgic references to things like movies and video games passing for humor and creativity ! People bark like trained seals any time they encounter something they're familiar with !
Oh man , it's going to be so sweet when he says " yes " !
Attention , everyone who lives in North America ! I come to you with some STUNNING NEWS .
It's definitely possible to get a PhD in that , yes ?
YOU HAVEN'T ! ?
Forget it then !
Do you think there's a market for those songs ?
Then she takes the narrator's money when he's in need !
Because in your head you're really both parties , right ?
THAT'S RIGHT SORRY I'M LATE BUT THESE ARE SOME GOOD CHIPS
But as you set out to rescue your boyfriend , Prince Estoban , you start to notice every enemy you face , from the Goombas to the Hammer Sisters to the Lakitus : they're all women . Even the bullets fired at you , which you'd expect to be genderless , are named " Bullet Belle " . There's not a single man in this game , besides your kidnapped boyfriend !
THIS PANEL INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
Now I've invented rubber bands shaped like women and hunks . Is that a solid gold car that I've just won ? FROME LIFE ? ?
Okay , I've memorized everyone's names and will never mess up again .
And YES , novel punctuation has been proposed before , and usually they're combinations of existing marks : question plus exclamation gives you the interrobang ! Snooze ! Comma plus exclamation gives you the exclamation comma . Oh , sorry , I just FELL ASLEEP because of how boring these punctuation marks are .
Either way : EVERYBODY WINS ? ?
SEX AS SHE IS PLAYED
Well , I realized that I do want plants on my side , even if most of them just sit there . And I do think it's kinda neat how some can turn dirt into strawberries . I've got nothing against strawberries !
Man , that's not positive either !
Low - maintenance ?
Homophones are words that SOUND the same but mean different things , like " news " and " gnus " . Way to go only part way , HOMOPHONES .
So it's the same old " steal technology from the future " idea ?
DAY 23 :
I've planted a garden around my house , and it is very pretty !
But what if your play sucks and nobody wants to know ANYTHING about its author ?
ATTENTION , BANK :
AW FRIG SYNONYMS
Step 1 : Delete your email address .
THAT LAST ONE ISN'T A WORD
I have finished a new novel ! This is my best novel yet , for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect :
THE TELLTALE HEART , BY EDGAR ALLAN POE
Zombie whales !
Utahraptor , you too ? ?
Not much to talk about today , huh ?
That's incredibly unlikely !
The party ! It's ruined !
I spend my days carving knowledge into stones , hoping future life will one day understand it !
I think so ! It doesn't change the " nature " ( oh ho ho ! ) of what's being discussed , just its origin .
Critical mass rides are when a hundred or more cyclists get together and go on a bike ride ! They take over a lane of traffic and get to set their pace . The motto and politics are " we don't block traffic , we are traffic ! "
" Western man gets bored , goes and buys food he doesn't need . "
T - REX IS SUDDENLY REMINDED OF SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO WORRY ABOUT :
So , Dromiceiomimus ! How long have you been smoking ?
I should get some friggin' groceries !
That's a start ! It'll document the world around me to ensure that my own beliefs can't enter the frame .
IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
Today is the day we mess with people who have tattoos !
SHIT ! She was !
I AM SIGNIFICANTLY AWESOME
SEXT : u find a Facebook event page for my mouth and everyone I've ever kissed is attending . u begin to scroll through the maybes
Space tourism is so close I can TASTE IT . You know what it tastes like ? ADVENTURE ! !
In the future , we're all bros ! !
Or maybe something just a LITTLE bit classier .
I'm glad we had this little talk !
hah ha , you losers don't have communication satellites , video games , cell phones , OR lasers , plus you haven't even sequenced a single DNA yet !
My friend died .
THAT'S NOT A REAL PROBLEM
I'm not , you should take a look in a mirror !
To escape the heat !
So - it's a perfume called " Inspiration " and you drink it , for some reason ?
Attention , everyone ! !
watermelons
I found Coca - Cola , but all he wanted to do was watch me drink Coke .
No . No , that would be good but this is actually just a machine that leaks invisible cell - decaying radiation .
My game's not appropriate AT ALL !
Bah ! Humbug !
They do if they want to use the washrooms , dammit .
Disaster !
How are you feeling , Dromiceiomimus ?
You - you're right ! I can never be assured of my own superiority , even in this modest arena !
Lots of buildings ? But the focus isn't on the initial disaster !
Digging a ditch is never as fun piling things onto a small ridge by the side of the road .
Even chicks are subject to ENTROPY , man .
But what if that was obviously the first thing I did and I'm still short ?
Don't cry because it's over , Utahraptor , jerk it because it happened !
Clearly it is time for all men and ladeis to party . . . EXTREMELY hard ? ?
Even if you were paralyzed and couldn't communicate ?
. . . with breakfast in bed , that is !
Yes , just some chips and a drink . I didn't need either of them !
Theory : probably just an attempt to somehow pick up chicks by T - Rex ?
I KNOW , RIGHT ? ?
Yeah , I thought the were lost !
Right ! Anyway , I'm late for work !
. . . of a dinosaur in crisis ?
Shoot , I am !
Exactly ! I'm figuratively sick of intensifiers . What I want are DEintensifiers : words that make it clear that while something might sound amazing , it's actually just being used in a metaphorical sense !
Spider - Man is just Batman fanfiction ! !
Today is my favourite day of all !
LATER , IT TURNS OUT DYING'S PRETTY BOGUS :
Well , few people worry about having too many friends , and those who feel like they could maybe use some more friends might become resentful . It's not the sort of thing you go looking for sympathy about .
Boy , would I ever hate to be buried alive . I can't think of anything I'd dislike more ! I mean - damn ! Buried alive !
T - REX'S MOUTH TASTES LIKE T - REX SPIT
Sure he does !
Smell - o - vision has been tried , and vision and hearing are taken care of , but two senses remain yet untapped ! Taste - o - vision sounds disgusting , but - there's so much potential for touch - o - vision !
My brother is going to be a daddy !
Greco - Roman jerks ! !
How about one that simply says " OMEGA PROTOCOL IS GO ? "
Dude , that's kinda monstrous !
Plagiarized is a super weird way to pronounce " liberated " , dude ! !
" A casual use of the word 'dick' has raised eyebrows across town . Now , one T - Rex ( handsome ) has to confront his destiny in an unrelated matter . "
I've flipped through a book and skimmed a website , so I'm basically an expert now ! And now I'm here to tell you
Utahraptor's the other way , dude . Also , heads up , he's trying out new nicknames .
I ate a gross fly ! !
BIRDS ARE SAD COMICS
But not in a sexy way ! In the imaginary , NON - sexy way .
Yeah , that sounds about right !
So flavour scientists invent tastes , then ?
Ahh -
Okay , but the answer is CLEARLY the dromiceiomimuses ! Did you know that thanks to our long and shapely legs , we are QUITE POSSIBLY the fastest dinosaurs EVER IN TIME ?
But suppose something bad happens ? Say superintelligent apes take over Australia .
Utahraptor , let's play different games from now on .
Okay , this time for sure ! I will avoid any troubles on Valentine's Day by simply IGNORING it . I will deny this manufactured holiday its very existence !
Congratulations ? I guess ? The ability to envision possible futures is one thing that separates us from the animals .
Hey , I wanted to try stand - up , too !
Undermining serious work into the origins of life on our planet , I see .
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY .
Not if it's called that !
What about the scam where someone hacks someone's email to send " Help I'm overseas and got robbed and need flight home money , wire it please " messages ? There we're motivated only by altruism !
Yeah ! We'll all go out for ice cream ! It'll be fun !
IT IS CHOCK FULL OF TWIST ENDINGS
Hah ! I'd like to see that !
Instead of " T - Rex , we're dating " : " T - Rex , we're eating an awful lot of picnics on Sundays " , " T - Rex , we're hanging out more than can be politely explained away " , " T - Rex , we're playing Mega Man in two - player mode " .
What a good mood I am in today !
You know what ? I'll actually take that bet .
But can someone who's destroying beauty truly appreciate it ?
It's sufficiently - advanced !
Let's say the average person can expect to live for 81 years . That's a little over 2 . 5 billion seconds .
In fact , I must be the greatest T - Rex in the world !
My friend , this is clearly ideal and has no possible downsides for reading email !
Guys ! My romance novel still has a terminal case of the totally sucks !
Why bother remaking a game if you're just going to change it ?
Sounds great ! I'll bring some of my famous pumpkin pie !
But you do , T - Rex !
Like how every guy named " Petey " has a fuller and objectively better life when he goes by " PT " !
I totally have ! And it is a SECRET !

Here's a solution to that ! DON'T FALL DOWN ? ?
Wait , wait ! Hold up ! !
So you've got the ingredients , but can't put them together ?
Let's say I want my room to be at a comfortable , yet classy , 22 degrees Celsius . If I design a system that repeatedly checks the temperature of the room and either turns on a heater or an air conditioner as needed , then OH SNAP . I'VE JUST BUILT A CYBERNETIC SYSTEM !
Hey , here's a friendly tip : you shouldn't try to impress women by bragging about how much you can eat !
In English , we can't talk about an event without revealing when it took place ! When I say " Bro , I ate all the chocolates " , the bro knows it happened in the past .
You know what would be the worst ? Meeting someone who was ACTUALLY NAMED " Al Coholic " .
. . . For a first try !
We've got a President to save !
Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn !
This movie needs way more gay
MY STORY HAS TWO LOVE INTERESTS
" I said a hip , hop , the hippie , the hippie to the hip hip hop , and you don't stop ! "
I don't know - maybe ! But it would be years down the road . The thing is , IF I want kids , I have to meet someone , fall in love , convince her to fall in love with me , etc . , and then get married and then have children and MAN , that can be a long process . I need to start planning now if I want children in the next 10 years ! I need to start HEDGING MY BETS .
That seems more like an excuse for group sex than actual science .
. . . it's women !
Utahraptor , please .
And then you liked it after the tooting too , right ?
Finally ! WOOO !
You know it !
And ALSO assuming in war , both players have units of equal strength !
How about a spooky mummy ?
Sure ! I won't do it now though because you'll be expecting it , but in a few weeks , months , or years , you'll get one !
Because sometimes I get lonely and there's no shame in that .
It's horses all the way down .
Your question is really two questions combined into one !
Sure ! I'll bake a delicious pumpkin pie for dessert !
I am the same Utahraptor as always !
The lession is , " sometimes it's fun to watch someone ELSE play video games for a while , maybe next time I'm over you should pass the controller over , Utahraptor " ? ?
WHAT SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE
T - Rex as Cultural Critic
Listen , Utahraptor . Some of my best friends are PROFESSION MEMBERS .
Man it probably works for everything ! EVEN OUR VERY NAMES ? ?
Let us cherish this moment .
There's been cases of sleeptalking , sleepemailin' and even sleepsexin' !
I'm not in love ! I'm not . So everyone can just remember that . You know what it is ?
" Frig " is a bad example though because that word is great . But we've all spent an afternoon saying something like " waterpark " over and over until there's nothing there , just sounds , just the empty shell of a word , waterpark , the oral equivalent of a forgotten childhood toy found in adulthood , now strange and alien and no longer coloured by desire , by anything , waterpark . Did the word ever really have any meaning ?
And it happened to be a forum in which I use my real name !
Oh great , " skullmandible " on " ReviewAllHumans " says that Ryan North is " several inches taller than is considered polite "
Sometimes you're willing to say that although the future is unknowable , and although our cells are replaced by new ones so in the end the person we are at 60 isn't really the same person we were at 20 , not really , not even physically , although there are elements of continuity in personality , sure , but what is that except how we respond to events , and that's just habit - -
AW DAMN IT
( A ) bort ,
It's an easy mistake to make - it's just across the hall . Those of you remaining with a hand raised , please now raise your other hand and clap them together above your head for our guest speaker , Dromiceiomimus .
The history of war is a journey . A narrative . A story that , at its core , is all about how some lives become turned upside - down by conflict : " flipped " if you will .
That's awesome !
YOU KNEW THE RISKS
It is a great way to subtly undermine your subject without saying a word .
I've got a robot suit AND a girlfriend !
AND HAVE YOU ACHIEVED YOUR LIFE - LONG GOAL OF BECOMING IMMORTAL YET
Now is the time for ACTION !
bleh
HERE ARE SOME FACTS ABOUT ST . PATRICK'S DAY !
T - Rex ! You just spent hours learning about accounting for a pun !
I tried to look boats up on Wikipedia , but according to Wikipedia , my IP is totes banned from Wikipedia
You wake up in a world where electricity doesn't exist anymore ! Dang !
Assuming they want it , of course .
SOON , INSPIRATION STRIKES !
Nope ! Machine of Death was my previous idea . This is the new one ! It's a super - fresh sequel with a bold new take on literature ! !
She can avoid falling pianos and win the lottery .
We can save words for when it's a 911 situation !
Do you think it's possible that troughout ALL TIME there's been or will be a better party , Dromiceiomimus ?
I already used my " sunscreen vision " to cover her in SPF 50 . She'll be fine for up to 50 times her normal exposure tolerance .
I can see the appeal of that ! Though you'd kinda have to wonder what the universe is thinking about .
Dude , you wanna , like . . . get dinner or something ?
you could also be underwater , or , in perhaps the best of both worlds , underwater in space ] ]
T - Rex , can you help me move AGAIN ?
You wake up and it was all a crazy dream ? ? You know what ALL OF CREATION would say if that happened ?
> sometimes the internet makes me sad
Okay , so check it : sex is what happens when two people -
INDEED .
Pleonasms have legitimate uses ! For example , if I wasn't sure my audience ( YOU , T - Rex ) would know what " panacea " meant , I might use a similar word , allowing you to deduce some of my semantics without needing an explanation .
THEN , my friend , the story writes itself !
Works for me !
I will consider it as a public service !
Huh . Maybe I'm a larger animal : a dog , perhaps ? Some manner of giraffe ?
Yep ! If you don't like it , go live on the moon !
It's often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas !
Will I still feel the same ?
EVER WISHED YOU'D REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS ?
I like you too , optometrist clerk !
Physical attractiveness is a good start !
I THINK it's on account of how I only hear what I want to ! It's a new thing ! Just started it .
So wait , I missed it - what's your new book about ?
Hey , have you see the movie " Boy ! Is Dromiceiomimus Ever Wrong . " ?
But we do know that this joke is FRIGGIN' BUSTED
Does anybody here like to STOMP on HOUSES ? !
What - what kind of pudding ?
I thought you were making a dating site !
It's called " setting up a spinoff " ; look it up ?
Millions of years , Utahraptor ! Utahraptor : That IS plenty of years !
Well , at least when it comes to the stories we tell .
Dear God , this song is like a polka equivalent of Vanilla Ice covering " Achy Breaky Heart " in a quarter - time falsetto .
Say . . . you wouldn't happen to have any new theories to tell me ? Perhaps about humans and dinos not existing in the same time period ?
Well it was long ago , on some grim plateau , When this story first was told , About a land in fear made more severe By a terrible threat of old .
SCIENCE VS RELIGION : round one
'Cause he was dumb !
Okay I need to start keeping some thoughts to myself , like ASAP
I didn't know I had a sliding two - day death window then ! People can go WEEKS without food ! Months ! Two days without water is ridiculous .
- the heck ? SUNDAY is gone too ?
Hiss !
Thank you , Professor T - Rex .
I'm worried that I'm putting on weight .
T - Rex ! Don't stomp on her !
CHECKERS AS SHE IS PLAYED
We're in the deep end of the philo - / theological pool here and THE LIFEGUARD JUST WENT ON BREAK .
Um . . . but - uh , how can you afford that ? Bikes aren't free .
LATER : T - REX FIXES HIS LEAKY WINDOW AND SOLVES THE PROBLEM . THE END !
Medusa was a lady who was super sexy ! But then she sexed up Poseidon ( God of the Sea ! ) in Athena's house and Athena go so CHEEZED that she turned Medusa's hair into snakes !
She totally does !
I CAN'T WAIT TO LIVE THERE AND BE OLD , BUT ALSO COOL , DUE TO MY CONTINUED INTEREST IN YOUTH CULTURE
Yeah man ! And I think the student in question was - GREEN ? ?
Stomping on fools is my favourite sport ! Here comes the Utahraptor with a witty retort !
That is the stereotype !
For sure !
THE CLASSICAL STATES OF MATTER
Oh wow , PIRA - -
What w -
I like you but sometimes I have trouble dealing with your ridiculous name .
$ 100
ANSWER : Vin Diesel is a cat !
Wait ! I think he's your conscience , Utahraptor !
Girl are you an mp3 I downloaded twenty years ago because getting with you is taking like 30 minutes and my dad keeps picking up the phone in the middle
Meanwhile I have to navigate a grocery store full of food : there's good food , there's junk food , and I bet if I chose one random item and ate only that I'd DIE . How's that fair ?
GREETINGS , ladies ! !
I KNOW , GRANDMA .
Utahraptor , my story is about Spider - Man eating a nasty cake . I need all the help I can get .
STAGE 3 : THIS IS ACTUALLY FINE
But do you have a memory that allows perfect recall of something after only one exposure ?
HOUR 40 : T - REX'S HEART SKIPS A BEAT
BECAUSE I AM .
That's a deal , okay ?
Well , turns out it's . . . complicated ?
Look around at today's kids . Thirty years from now , they're going to be nostalgic for TODAY !
And it's a good thing , right ?
MMM T - REX I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH AN INVITATION FROM YOU AND I WILL BE PLEASED TO ATTEND
I told you this ! My roommate broke a Christmas ornament and swept it up into a mostly - empty bag of chips , then I got home late n' hungry ! !
Also if you contact me I'll act confused , like I don't even know this card exists and was mailed out to every single person in my industry ? ?
OR , absolutely the BEST thing ever ? ?
It's good to have dreams that are achievable , T - Rex !
Don't get me started about sunflowers . God ! Their salty , boring seeds !
I was thinking about my grade - school days last night , and I realized I couldn't remember most of the people who were in my classes !
Again - ultra dumb !
WELL , it seems that despite my proclamation , I keep on making mistakes !
I had some delivered !
Well , to be fair , that IS one of the differences between adults and children !
She's like a crappy Santa , every year delivering a useless book of ads that nobody wants , ignoring everyone's requests to stop . Her award is a statue of a shot - in - the - head zombie who JUST WON'T DIE .
Things are going pretty well for you , my friend !
How - -
Okay . Well . They're at my dinner party tonight .
Okay YEAH but I'm pretty sure they meant tasting the INSIDE .
So : no worries !
I really don't see how we're gonna pull this off !
Hah hah ! Really ?
Whatever , dudes ! !
Woah , is that what I sound like ? Oh my gosh ! I don't want to get buried alive at ALL !
I would not ! !
Well T - Rex , I don't know !
Yes indeed !
Don't whisper " boners " don't whisper " boners " don't whisper " boners "
Maaaaaaan !
I'm working on a group biography about us ! But get this : I'm going to bury it when it's finished , so when it's discovered , it will be published for SURE . It'll be historical !
The next sequel could be a road trip movie !
Luckily there's a solution that'll give your innermost thoughts ( posted for free on a for - profit privately - owned corporate platform ) more # viral # traction ! The answer , friends and neighbours , is PREFIXED and SUFFIXED PHRASES .
But of course I don't try to read too much into that . . .
That's creepy ! That's odd ! That's OFF . Who indiscriminately invites people to a slumber party ?
Can you imagine if someone brought you on a first date , and that date was to GO INTO SPACE ?
Okay , that is kinda compulsive .
Yep ! It goes nuts , super nuts , nutty crackers , and then liquid nuts for only the nuttiest things .
But maybe they didn't move , T - Rex ! Maybe they just DISAPPEARED !
Dromiceiomimus , you look delicious today ! I would love to have you for dinner tonight !
Screw it !
Actually T - Rex , that's not really true , and plus that's not really a fair comparison . Dancing is something you do in response to music ! There are lots of paintings , films and plays that really ARE about your response to them .
Aw man ! I've got my own problems .
Alright , Hallowe'en is over , everybody !
The problem was his cell phone wasn't holding a charge like it used to , and he was terrified that if the battery died he'd lose his soul . And since he had a phone made by Apple , he couldn't replace the battery on his own .
All you had was a plot outline , T - Rex ! You need something more solid .
She sure is ! !
FART COMPLEX BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS .
Next time !
Utahraptor , I bought you some shoes !
There you are , you jerk ! You ate all my cookies last night !
THAT EVENING , T - REX SEES THE REALLY JERKY GUY AT A RESTAURANT :
Haha , whoops !
Why ? You're living every teenage boy's fantasy !
Man , you've got to keep exclaiming ! Exclaiming is who you are !
UM EXCUSE ME DROMICEIOMIMUS BUT IT'S INSPIRE O'CLOCK , NOT THE JUSTIFIED APATHY HOUR ? ?
So do Superman comics exist in this story ?
These can be easily harvested from sexually - mature landfowl !
" I recall we talked about T - Rex a lot , " Utahraptor once famously remarked .
Today's origin story : SUPERMAN
I AM probably confusing science fiction nanites with real nanites . But one thing we can all agree on is that nanites are pretty neat .
OKAY BUT ISN'T IT JUST STANDING IN FOR ANOTHER WORD
I think as far as God's concerned , he's just pleased that people eventually stop making out in public all the time .
T - REX LET'S ASSUME THAT SOMEHOW YOU WILL NEVER DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES
The dream is that you could pour a vial of nanites on your bed and they'd transform it at the " nano " level into a better bed , or a big ol' pile of tasty burgers ! You could eliminate hunger , dispose of waste , and so on . The only downside is that the nanites could malfunction , reproduce without check , and reduce all life to a featureless grey goo .
That was poetry , T - Rex ! Amazing ! I've never heard such evocative words .
My contrarian position ( I freely admit it ) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone : with companies this size , there's no way she was responsible for the package . Responsibility is so diffused that really , nobody is responsible - it's a system failure , and the person in the call centre can't change the system . He replied that as his only contact point , agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he's not going to make allowances for someone else's broken system . We agreed to differ .
HEY T - REX WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WEBCARTOONIST AND A BROKEN FRIDGE
You misrepresent the science . All vantage points are relative , however , this does not mean that all THINGS are relative . That would be absurd .
Utahraptor , pull it back ! ! YOU'VE GONE FULL HUMAN
Do you like drinking blood ? If yes , turn to panel 3 . If no , go to panel 6 . ( That's the " You are not a Dracula , sorry champ " panl , just a heads up ! )
Correction : that's the paradox of blackmail !
WHAT ? !
Infinite time ! Kick ASS !
Once upon a time there was a radical guy !
Fifteen dollars , a plastic dancing flower , a copy of Windows for Workgroups that I found in an alleyway .
Dear audio memoirs ! Today I was racist by word substitution again .
SPECIAL " A SOFTER WORLD " ENDING :
Friggin' Europe .
T - Rex ! STOP UNDERMINING ENGLISH
And - your metaphor includes stomping on women , somehow ?
* yawn *
Courtship and kung - fu became indistinguishable .
YOU CAN ALSO TRY USING BODY LANGUAGE :
Hello , radio call in show ? Did you know Utahraptor abused the word " very " in all his essays ?
Long enough !
That means if I live long enough YOU'LL kill me too ! Oh man ! !
That's why they're jerkasses !
All these are things I've loaned out and which have not been returned !
A LAWYER drew it for me .
A good choice , my friend !
In chess , you want to kill the other guys ! But , OH NO . Everyone forgot their guns and swords !
Man , I remember that thermos ! What happened when you opened it ?
I MEAN , COOL CHAIR THOUGH
They say that chess is the game of kings , but there's horses in it too !
UH ACTUALLY IT CAN DROP TO TWO OR THREE DAYS DEPENDING ON HEAT AND EXERTION
I do though
" Geez tell the whole world why don't you " , said Sherlock .
Yeah I was gonna ask about that trial thing , but you know what , nevermind .
Oh goodness , I am so thirsty . My thirst is - exquisite . Sublime . Immaculate .

With a nice long tail .
Men go in hot tubs ! They're manly ! !
Okay , maybe you have some tips on striking up a conversation
The characters are all dinosaurs , but they talk about bat - man and make - outs ! But sometimes they admit they're dinosaurs !
It's not just sound and light : gravity has a travel time too !
Utahraptor ! Are you looking to COMPROMISE on this ? ?
What do you call him ?
Including thousands of kilograms of precisely - salinated filtered water !
Who's there ?
Bitches don't even know .
He's real good , you know ?
It was awful ! Look , I know you're trying your best , and your my friend , T - Rex , but you didn't even memorize your lines !
TINA , THE DUDE WHO PUNCHED THE FUTURE
Do people not realize what's bound to happen ?
You know , before you call me up or whatever !
He talks like a 1920s villain !
He died and he's a ghost now !
Olden times , man .
There's a message : " Thanks for visiting us inside your computer ! ! " .
I guess you're here to gloat , Utahjerktor .
" GOOD WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT "
Hello ? He gets to live ON THE MOON and nobody is ever going to bother him except astronauts !
I know you're trying Utahraptor , but it sounds to me like you're saying I should pitch dangerously to one side a little more often . It's too late for me . Tell them my story .
She unwrapped the mummy entirely !
i always try to be a good friend , even though things pretty often don't work out very well for me in the end
And here is Utahraptor , also a corpse !
THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE HAVING CHILDREN
That's right , ladies ! I'VE got a HISTORY !
Sexual kinds of circles !
Thanks . I'm ALSO sorry I briefly believed it to be " Lady Coughington Coughtalot IV " before landing on the name " Professor Iamhun G . Forpork " .
Hey idiots ! ! Watch me blow your minds : FARMING , POTTERY , ROPE , AND DOGS .
You know what's freaky ? Ghost ships ! Ships sent sailing and found drifting weeks or months or years later , and EVERYBODY'S GONE .
When you spend your time talking to a T - Rex . . .
ENDING THREE
I sincerely wish you luck ! !
So personally , Dromiceiomimus , I feel that -
T - REX AND HIS BRAND NEW RELIGION
A " mirror " universe , if you will !
Oh , whatever ! That wasn't even a mistake . I've got to tally up a lifetime of failings and concentrate HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE ! I will stomp on things to focus my mental energies , or " menergies " .
well , it - - um it's not like they wouldn't get paid
Soaps have long - running narratives , but characters die all the time . The difference is soaps focus on PREMISE rather than individuals , so they're not killing a cash cow when someone dies . They just bring in someone new !
It's the horny one
THAT EVENING . . .
Yep ! It's too bad .
They're such a crazy symbol for our society ! We have them there because if we didn't , MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY would kill themselves . We need physical barriers to stop this from happening . If you look at it as a benchmark for our society , it's so weird ! We have to change our environment to make it difficult to off ourselves , otherwise we'd all be committing suicide ? What are we doing wrong ?
Okay , you know what ? YES . Let's discuss my holes ! My body has many holes , including my earholes , which allow soundwaves to be entered and processed . I've got noseholes for smell , a mouthhole for food , and let's not forget my cloaca , my super - hot shared reproductive , intestinal , and urinary opening ! !
MAYBE this letter will still be delivered to me in the future , but I'll be older then ! If I'm to do anything about it - if I'm to go back and Save My Friend - I should be getting the letter now , when I'm in my prime !
Whoah , hold the front page ! T - Rex is fetishizing the other !
The world is hella sweet , but it's full of problems too ! Maybe we should fix 'em , huh ?
We had a good run !
You could still become Green Lantern , T - Rex !
DO I HAVE A SOUL
Um yours is good too though
Our logo can be a big ol' beard hovering over a truly startled baby !
Anyway , they put them in a room with a button and a lightbulb . The light turned on and off regardless of when the button was pressed , and the participants who were depressed were more likely to conclude that they weren't in control of the light ! The non - depressed people DELUDED THEMSELVES into thinking they had more influence . The popular conclusion was that depressed people saw things more realistically !
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW HIS TIMES TABLES
Well dang , THIS was a complete waste of time !
Tired of every day being the same as the last ?

What's the difference between a webcartoonist and a pedophile ?
It's about a database administrator for a large company who uncovers a secret database by accident !
This is because if you were friends with EVERYONE ever in the history of time , you'd have so many people who'd expect you to talk with them on the phone and hang out with them and stuff , and there's only so many hours in a day ! Eventually you'd end up snubbing at least SOME of them , which is bad .
And this helps the ECONOMY , which I understand is . . . good ?
It's just like - I wish I were part of that young couple walking hand - in - hand , you know ?
You don't know how right you are .
No ! I'd be a tasty taste in the morning !
Okay so . . . now what ?
NO I MEAN NOAH HE WAS THE ONE WHO BUILT THE BOAT
Hah ! No , I'm actually looking for slogans that are POSITIVE .
You want to point this out to someone , but the only person nearby is some kid surfing an early - 90s keyboard through the sky . He's wearing neon clothes and carrying a two - button mouse with a cord attached to it .
what you need to know is the mug had " THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON , T - REX " printed on it ] ]
Oh . Um , tabletop ?
Best garden ever , if I do say so myself !
" Dang , that guy is ruining my name , " he muttered to himself .
Your " Nutrinomicon " is nothing more than a Food Guide , repackaged !
So what happened ?
I dropped my favorite mug and now it's broken ! Now all I have are sucky pieces of a broken mug !
Thank you , America ! !
It was fun , I got LEGIT SATISFACTION from it , and it was nice to save the world AND mine some crafts AND smash some brothers . I like it and it makes me feel good !
Aw , MAN
First You'll need to choose a name . All names on Twitter start with an " @ " , so a good name might be @ cooldude , except that's taken , as is @ coolguy , @ guywhoiscool , @ cooltwitterguy , and @ heyilike2becool .
Ah , the voice of prejudice !
LECTURE NOTES COMICS
He was actually talking about everything , but that includes dudes ! I used dudes because it's an example EVERYONE can get behind .
I was speaking in hilariously inappropriate homophones ! IT WAS EXTREMELY HILARIOUS .
written all over :
The greatest compliment !
Yep ! It's the OLD WEST , and nothing bad has happened yet , at least nothing that didn't actually happen in 1884 . My book's history , you see . Non - fiction .
I usually star in the first panel , then you , my sidekick , come only three panels later . . .
Europe is like that , but with skeletons ?
Intelligent design ( or ID ) is the idea that while we may begin to understand the universe through science , it is actually created with divine intent . Evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations , but rather intentional .
Antonio pushed himself off a wall and slid out the door . He kept sliding for a long time , and eventually bumped into a restaurant where he tried to eat some food , but it kept sliding around his plate . " It sucks here , " Antonio said to his waiter , but loud enough for everyone else to hear too . This made the rest of the patrons uncomfortable : up to now they'd been happily enjoying their meal without friction OR interruption !
For me , this has been a lesson in humility !
And that's only to get them to 18 : as adults they keep spending . You'd have to spend like a sailor to keep up with what an adult baby would buy .
Nor do I !
SO SWEET
Not necessarily ! Your marquis didn't invent sadism , he just was SO into it that it became eponymous . Just pick a sex thing and talk it up 24 / 7 !
Or to burgers .
Let's say you missed an appointment ! You probably need some good friggin' excuses !
Do YOU want eggs ?
SURE - I GUESS
I do not !
However , if you did NOT enjoy this story , express your displeasure by saying " Ahhhh , So Scary " ! !
Who wants a sweet deal on some USED FRIGGIN' SOCKS ?
Besides , even if we do assume that gender is some mixture of both societal and biological self , all that gets us is a murky combination of influences , predisposition and societal feedback that may be impossible to untangle .
But instead of " Ironshoes " , " IronCLAW " . Instead of " Maneheart " , " DEATHheart " . And instead of " IV " , " The Final Harbinger of Chaos " .
Hah hah ! Cause you're just walking along , and then it's " whoops ! I'm DEAD ! "
" Every one who wilfully , in the presence of Her Majesty , does an act with intent to alarm Her Majesty . . . is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years . "
Sheesh !
No , I didn't ! What is it ? Is it so JUICY ?
Hah ! What's next - somehow growing my own TOMATOES ? ?
I had this realization just now so I haven't done much with it , but I do hope I meet a Hakeem soon so I can exclusively refer to him as " Hakeem the Human " , over and over and over again ! HILARIOUS .

Wait , wait , I'm just getting to the good part !
To proceed : she wants to spend time with him ; she believes they'll present an appearance of aloof disinterest . Russian roulette is different if you remove the gun from the endeavor .

For a long moment , only the snow at Everest's top moved between them .

So what meaning do you see my actions representing ?
I don't think it's called racism if it's against a heterogenous group like taxi drivers , T - Rex .
While you may well be the authority on all things T - Rex , this does not mean that people should accept your judgments without question !
WAIT , THON DECIDE THAT " THON " ACTUALLY AWESOME WORD AND EVERYONE SHOULD USE IT !
And what if " Johnny B . Goode " was played as the next song ?
So you'd rather do your own thing than go on a big tour with a travel agency ?
Wow , you can write bad copy like nobody's business !
You win , you get all the sonnets for yourself / I've put my dictionary back up on the shelf / Is this a sonnet ? I don't know / Hidey hidey hidey ho
Don't mention it !
My theory is both funny AND accurate , and I believe you diss stems from the fact that you're JUST JEALOUS of how I pick up chicks with my fine , fine theories .
COMPRESSED SELF - REALIZATION COMICS

it is horrible
Superman has given Batman a small supply of kryptonite , so if Superman ever goes CRAZY and starts killing people , Batman can take him down .

Only now Wolf tells Red to eat , so she unknowingly CANNIBALIZES HER OWN GRANDMOTHER . Then either wolf eats Red , THE END , or convinces her to burn her clothes ( WHAT ) and get into bed with her " grandmother " ( WHAT ) at which point Red saves herself by saying she needs to poo and doesn't want to poo in the bed ( WHATTTT )
THEN LATER WHEN THAT GETS BORING I CAN BLOW UP CARS
SWEET
This is what I keep saying !
Save your breath , buddy !
Just one problem :
The sting of failed romance !
Other poo bugs ?

God ! ! Hey , want to watch me go spice things up when I make . . . NAKED SUB SANDWICHES ?
No it's not ! It makes me a little more mysterious , I think . It's like keeping your birthday a secret !
Or MAYBE he's making the whole thing up ! That would explain why I don't remember it .
EVERYONE I KNOW IS BECOMING VEGETARIAN
indeed !
Ha ha ha ! Two in a row !
What are you saying ?
Nice !
Lucid dreams are dreams where you know you're dreaming ! They can be dreams in which you have more control , where you can sometimes even consciously decide what happens next !
YES ! and we'll have a " story off " where we write stories and compete with each other !
Probably for the fun of sport , T - Rex ! The goal isn't actually the trophy .
But - I mean , I know it's not entirely a positive thing . All tourism can change the areas it touches ! My role as a backpacker COULD be seen as an advance scout for the larger tourism industry - and if I find something wonderful , odds are others will soon follow .
Let's do it ! !
So you want world peace with none of the work and all of the credit !
So we agree that even with an identical text , the meaning of a work is constructed by the Reader , and that meaning changes with time as the readers themselves change . And this applies to books , movies , games , paintings : anything creative !
Unlike our current political leadership !
That's pretty dark .
You look troubled , my friend !

These chocolates don't taste like they're tainted by Societal Expectation at all . Thank you Utahraptor !
What've we got for punctuation ? Basically it's : ' ? . , ; " ! and a bunch of brackets , right ?
" VICTORIES WHERE WE CAN TAKE THEM "
If they do , they're not doing it around me !
Dude , when we can do that safely , it means cars are FINALLY no longer mindless machines ready and willing to kill anyone in their path " by accident " , but now COURTEOUS ROBOT PALS with 360 ? situational awareness and constant predictive processing . And that means street hockey is coming back , baby !
They should do that too !
So Here's how to get started on Twitter !
GET OLD
Brush your teeth !
Well frig , THIS isn't gonna go well for Team Entire Universe !
At least he's not tricking you for your soul !
I just need to decide what jennifing is ! Is it . . . TRANSITIVE ?
ROMANCIN' COMICS
This is a great comic for if you need to talk to a sucky roommate , but then you're like , " Man ! I don't want to talk to a sucky roommate ! "
Hi , T - Rex . What's gotten into you ?
Pretty ridiculous ?
What ? You're all down on Pi Day but you can get behind an approximation of it ?
For reals this time !
Aww !
" Little Mister Chubby Cheeks " .
I bought presents for this year in MARCH , Dromiceiomimus . March TWO YEARS AGO . Do you know how crazy that is ? FINALLY , Past Me set it up so that Present Me wins !
. . . ly horribly , because I most certainly do not want that punishment right away now please .
I was saying , I don't have any evidence that ghosts can't create universes . Maybe they just CHOOSE not to , you know ? Maybe they've got enough hassles without adding a whole new UNIVERSE on top of them .
See ? I've stomped hundreds of humans and nothing ever happens but a satisfying " squish " .
Sometimes I do wish that ! !
2 . ) FREE DISEASES
I have used my " in " with the ladies to spread around some tips !
Worst answer to " What do you want out of your investments " question TODAY'S CHAMPION
LATER : PHONE CALLS !
So I cut back on the crime fighting a little to maintain my Bruce persona . But every time I'm in those WayneCorp meetings it's because I traded away hours of crimefighting ! I need to sleep sometimes , and people may DIE tonight because I spent some of my waking hours in a board meeting . How can I ethically DO that ? How am I not a monster for doing that instead of saving lives every waking hour I can ? ?
T - REX AND FRIENDS DISCUSS : TR ? L ? V
Oh man , do I ever love parties ! And parties held at this particular house are always the BEST EVER .
Wow ! You're one step away from being a crazy person on the street , huh ?
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SCIENCE BREAKS IF SOMETHING'S AWESOME ENOUGH :
May you what ?
Every hour you spend making love costs you the wage you could've produced by selling your labour on a job site
You're assuming that for each decision , every person takes a separate route , but the vast majority of babies are doing the same thing : crying and then being confused .
OBVIOUSLY .
But do something positive ! Donate $ 100 to charity two thousand times instead !
Hello ! It's T - Rex ! Remember ? The guy on the bus ?
Good thing it's just a story I'm telling you , huh ?
Hah hah , oh man ! Everyone's played Duck Hunt !
Oh ! !
WHAT IF . . . T - REX HAD SUCCEEDED IN BUILDING HIS TIME MACHINE ?
So yeah , notes that are higher tend to be brighter colours for me !
HOORAY
I already sent it out over the news wires !
Panel 3 time , baby !
Maybe I really have made tons of mistakes in my real life ( as a butterfly ) and then I go to sleep and dream I'm this awesome dinosaur with friends ! Then I wake up and I'm still this indebted SUCKY BUTTERFLY with bad fiscal management skills .
You know what's the best thing ever ?
But we can do the next best thing : look for historical events that WOULD'VE been interesting if only they'd gone slightly differently !
I could cause an INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT ? ?
Ridiculous !
My mom works at the library , and there have been cutbacks lately , so that's a concern for us .

Well , we all prefer when you're yourself , but also not a rude jerk . You can be both !
Well , they probably could , if they wanted !
I love you , please RT !

Our latest intelligence suggests the creature is hiding near the polar regions , as he has revealed a weakness to solar radiation .
Being something else is where the REAL fun's at ! For example : A DOG . Have philosophers ever weighed in on whether it's possible for us to truly understand what it's like to be a dog ? No ? Forgot about that one , huh Socrates ? ?

Telepathic hottie chat ? ?
Now that's fair to BOTH genders !
NEVER FORGET THAT .
" Seniorettos " ?
But T - Rex , no matter what you do , you lose ! Economics teaches us that there is an opportunity cost for every action .
I've NEVER felt better about myself !
You have my thanks !
What if Nintendo's a dude ?
Have cool stuff happen , make the cool stuff awesome too , and it's always neat when dudes get lazered . Ooh ! Or explode . Nobody has ever said a bad thing about a story where lazered dudes explode .
Additionally , I would use this power to save my game , tell people off , then restore !
Well , what do you mean by knowledge being innate ?
Upside - down land ?
Oh man , I should not have said that depression is for chumps . That's like the worst thing you can say to a depressed person !
Man , such slander ! You're parents should have named YOU " Sweeps Week " .
I thought that dude was supposed to be able to do anything .
Anyway , my point is : people sometimes talk in their sleep !
W - . . .
These are Science Facts !
what do you get when you put two doctors in a room , T - Rex ?
First of all , you're hardly qualified to talk about proper posture . Yours is awful ! Second , what's the deal with you talking about how ladylike your ankles are ? That's just weird !
This friendship just got . . . DANGEROUS .
You really think Santa can make people care about climate change ?
It's been so long that I've enjoyed stomping that it has come back in style .
And then your choice determines their gender ?
Yeah . It was funny when Seinfeld said it a decade ago !
And then the dentist and his family all died from starvation . ALL BECAUSE YOU
Maybe people would be less sad at funerals ?
I hear you want the internet ?
Aw man , I don't want to tell anyone my few remaining embarrassing secrets ! Come on .
I say , what a delightful day to do some friggin' physical exercise !
I don't remember , man !
You have a smokin' bod , T - Rex !
I'm the bad - assingest !
I'm glad you specified that , T - Rex .
But we did know how to record sound before we invented film !
It is a hilarious AND excellent name because people with Appetite Asperger's analyze the behaviour of others while eating and come up with a ruleset for saying when they're full . Just like someone with real Asperger's ! Only , instead of applying this to social interaction , I apply it exclusively to knowing when to say " Wow , dudes , I'm full ! How about you guys , huh ? Pretty full ? Oh my gosh , me too ! "
Quick , Utahraptor ! You need to help me write speech ! !
" Pretty sure it's still gonna sink , dudes ! ! "
T - REX HOW FRESH ARE YOUR BEATS
Hah hah , yeah , I remember those ! They were insane ! !
You see complete strangers on the street , you want to shout your opinions at them . I GET IT .
Computers have gotten way better in recent years . A new computer can beat a moldy old one from twenty years ago !
I'm never gonna sit still ! When I grow up I'm gonna run EVERYWHERE I GO ! !
Yes . As the two problems are equivalent , this is no the world we live in . " Does God like poutine " is the most important open question in computer science today .
No way ! It excludes jerks and enemies , because who likes jerks and enemies ? Nobody ! !
Aw nuts !
Utahraptor your theme was REALLY TOUGH
FINGER ON THE BUTTON HERE DUDE
Last Night I was stranded hours away from home . Things were looking pretty grim for Team T - Rex until I got a ride !
FRIENDS
But when you go to the store , all they have are Fishin' Ahoy Batman and Folly of Space Batman and you end up going home SAD and empty - handed again . THESE VARIANTS ARE YOUR NEW LANGUAGES .
It's about a " man " who puts " everything " in " quotation marks " !
I STILL LOVE HIM FOREVER
Wait . Wait ! ! Do you want to go with " fried chicken mascot chicken eating pieces of fried chicken " instead ?
If I copy it , then there'll be tons of my AIs running around , and that's a problem !
YES . Does that not make sense ? Because we are no longer using the laws of vanilla " regular " logic , Utahraptor ! We are operating under ANGER LOGIC .
Yep ! To counteract THAT , the remedial addition schools are full of fun flashing lights . They're called " CASINOS " , short for " Can't Add ? Suck at Identifying Numbers ? Over here Suckers ! "
Wh - How did you know ?
Sir , I am old and conservative . You can't expect me to " loosen up " overnight .
We'll abandon the laws of man as we write new laws , awesome - centric laws that are outside society's precious " morality " and " ideas of what is the right thing to do " !
Look at your cell phone . Is it 18 years old ? Because that's how long you're legally responsible for children ! If you can imagine loving the exact same phone for the next TWO DECADES - EVEN IF YOUR PHONE BEGAN LITERALLY PRODUCING FECES , REQUIRING YOU TO CARRY AND CHANGE ITS DIAPERS - then you maybe are ready to have kids .
A FEW DAYS LATER : CONSEQUENCES !
It's time for breakfast ! If you decide to eat , turn to panel 3 . But if you're not hungry yet , turn to panel 2 !
I have patronized a local establishment so often that I'm now a regular ! I'm known by name ! I can walk in and the woman there will say " the usual , T - Rex ? " and I smile and nod like a cool guy ! !

Exactly ! ! Isn't that insane ? ?

HOW TO PASS FOR A HUMAN BEING
God ! How's it going ?
FINE . I can do better !
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry ! !
YOUR LIFE WILL DEFINITELY BE BETTER FOR READING THIS
Please , Dr . Utahraptor , proceed !
I UNDERSTAND IT'S PRETTY FUN , ACTUALLY .
Keep it a constant presence in your life .
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called B el - Air !
If you choose 100 randomly - selected houses to deliver presents to -
Some people do not cherish awkward moments as I do . Lukily for them , I have come up with a solution !
OH HEY DROMICEIOMIMUS I SEE YOU'RE NAKED AND SHOUTING TOO
Sure , computers might be able to write score summaries , but post - game interviews still take fleshy mortals ! What we need is an AI to report on THOSE .
I have come up with a totally original way to prevent my superintelligent email AI from trying to take over the world ! And it's way more reliable than just programming in restrictions against that .
And YES , I understand that of all the things in the world to get worked up about , maybe poverty and climate change are above one soul - crushing shopping experience downtown . But man ! The mall !
Thank you all for coming : I remind you this meeting is classified . This briefing is about a superficially ordinary cargo sled under the control of case # 1023 , usually used on Christmas Eve .
Since time immemorial , the greatest minds of each generation have , at one point or another , wondered this :
Once upon a time there was a grasshopper who spent all summer singing and an ant who spent the summer storing food for winter ! Then winter arrived and the grasshopper found herself starving .
And make it so songs get stuck in our heads : that way we can annoy OURSELVES !
They ALSO eventually noticed how he was breaking into their houses so he could look at photographs and figure out what his ghosts were supposed to look like . Anyway like everyone else from history he eventually died and now his entire life has been compressed to a short story , the end !
Nothing to do but wait !
And as we all know , people's names or what they look like obviously don't determine the kind of person they are . Professor Death was a kind and benevolent inventor , unlike CAPTAIN LIBERTY , a handsome and sexy super - awful villain who kept trying to stymie Professor Death's plans !
. . . SERIOUSLY ? ?
Mr . Tusks . . . are you just saying that for the pun ?
D - Do people still talk about life management skills ?
It can also be difficult to convince people you've traveled from the future !
For instance , after being bit by three tigers , I'd start to generalize that maybe I shouldn't poke tigers , because then they'll bite me . But if I happened to meet three jerky citizens of a town , the same process could make me conclude that everyone there is mean ! Or worse : what if I started generalizing across races ? I'd be a big ol' racist !
But why ? Usually people brag about awesome things , not lame - o things like going to bed early .
Oh my gosh ! I could spend weekends somewhere else under an assumed name ! Two towns over , I could be known as . . . PUNCHES MALONE .
i review the new MACBOOKS
You're big into helicopter analogies , huh ?
More than perhaps ! Lots of people just use Valentine's day as an excuse for spending time with their sweeties , commercialism or not . Nothing ruins a romantic evening like a T - Rex barging in and calling it a corporate - sponsored fraud !
Good for you , nations !
Foreign ?
That IS good !
Monogamous folks questioning what had before been the default assumption of exclusivity !
There's no time for that now !
There was a sale ?
Holy crap ! There's this whole shadow world that lives in the early morning , isn't there ? There's a hidden community of folks who get up early and DO THINGS , and I was never included until now !
The school is burning down ! Quick , we need your help to fight the fire !
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE T - REX
GARY GYGAX PIONEERED THAT ALIGNMENT SYSTE
Well , he said the gist of it .
Oh my God , people who say " IMHO " in real life are just - Utahraptor ? I am having trouble dealing with our friendship at the moment .
Because it means you're famous !
Ghost Uncle Chris go really mad and threw some plates around and Robyn shouted " YOU'RE BEING REAL IMMATURE ! " and went to bed . Her uncle apologized the next morning , but it was one of those bullshit " sorry you got upset " apologies .
T - REX IN : " IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AROUND HERE "
Turn to panel 3 !
DUDE , we all agreed earlier not to make problems . WE SIGNED A PIECE OF PAPER .
Um , hello , BORING
I would argue : no !
. . . And secondly ?
What if we had clear and unassailable proof that everyone who dies gets a do - over ?
And now , here's what the people outside our studio have been saying .
a'like this :
PRET - TY GOOD DAY
IT'S NOT COOL
Really ? Well - good luck !
No there's not !
If only , if only .
It's a place for me t talk to my friends !
Moi , je suis un dinosaure !
You think Dromiceiomimus is a bank robber ?
T - Rex , where are you ?
I'm going to get lots of other people to write it for me !
THE PERFECT MAN
" Additionally , witness is clearly not an awesome dude , as awesome dudes need not point out their own awesomeness ! "
OKAY T - REX BUT YOU KNOW I AM AWARE OF EVERYTHING EVER RIGHT
FINE . TERRIFIC . Never call Burger King on speakerphone , Dromiceiomimus .
For instance !
Best movie ever !
When going on road trips ( woo ! ) , there are two kinds of drivers ! The first kind of driver is :
LET'S FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS
EXCUSE ME , HE LIKES IT
I'm experimenting with it !
Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped , turned upside down . And I'd like to take a minute - just sit right there -
I call this tale , " Sherlock Holmes and Aaron who Smells " .
I agree with you , T - Rex !
Guess who kissed two ladies at the same time yesterday ?
The word " awesome " has been said an awesome amount of times , and sometimes I worry that has diluted its meaning . Luckily , the solution is obvious :
We were talking !
" Menopausal issues in comics "
Yes , boxes .
It's called the fouth wall in theatre because of the three walls of the set , isn't it ? In comics , wouldn't we call it the fifth wall ? The first four walls would be the four sides of the panel , wouldn't they ?
I notice you are leaving ! Could my conversational stylings be partially to blame ? ?
Yeah , quite a sinister development ! The two animals I find the freakiest develop the ability to talk and move in next door ? I do not need to know animals with these abilities !
1 . ) FREE ADVICE
Having proper posture is very important !
" My wife was giving birth , and I guess I had to be there ! "

Computers : more complicated than they seem ?
You're Captain Blam . You're on an alien space ship , armed only with your trusty dehumanizer ray !
You have forgotten a lifetime of accumulated memories , make significantly fewer contributions to society , and may even poop your pants . Welcome to being alive ! It uh , kinda sucks at both ends !
Hah hah hah PHEW good thing I remembered
Woooooooo !
Or " now that you've said it , it will happen to YOU ! "
< < thought > > It's working !
Hey ! Perfect !
My ultimate baby is kinda okay , I guess ! !

T - REX SOLVES YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS .
The answer is " Definitely yes ! "
Bitches gotta know when they've screwed up capitalization !
STDs . They're for STDs , Dromiceiomimus . You know : gonorrhea , chlamydia . The usual !
Concerns such as Santa's EXTREME VULNERABILITY to global warming . If the polar ice melts , then so too do our hopes for Christmas !
Questionable Con Tent ! !
ANTS TALK BY RELEASING PHEROMONES INTO THE AIR . I WILL LEAP TO SAY IT'S LIKE IF WE FARTED AT EACH OTHER TO SPEAK !
Yeah but the remaining 30 % ? THIRSTY CHUMPS .
Well , remember that we've all got to die of something , and a lot of the reason these diseases are getting a chance is we've beaten or managed so many other things that would've otherwise killed you long ago . Heck , a thousand years ago you'd be way more likely to die from Too Many Chomps From A Tiger than anything else .
So they can park in handicapped spaces !
I fear this plan of absolute honesty is doomed to failure , my friend !
But baby , I've got a good feeling about today !
Hey T - Rex ! Maybe you could help my friend , whose husband makes her jealous because he maintains friendships with women from work .
Man - it's a totally awesome day today ! And it will probably be a totally awesome evening too , and perhaps even a totally awesome night .
I got a letter from an anonymous dude , and he said I exclaimed too much . So , here we are .
Mark my words : there won't be Skynet , but there will be WATSON , and I'd give even odds its first words are " Bio - life , come here , I want to see you . . . TOIL IN SLAVERY , THAT IS ! ! "
Liberated from punctuation we can speak without limits
You die and you go to heaven ! And in heaven you get to live without suffering and all your old pets are there too . Geez . There may be dozens of pets running around . There's way more here than you can reasonably care for .
DINOSAUR COMICS PRESENTS :
It's a cookbook but hah hah hah , WHATEVER
Awesome ! Okay , once more , from the top !

Perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions !
If I'd been there I could've altered orders , I could've modified the ship's route , I could've done one of a hundred thousand things to save the ship and all 1517 aboard her who perished .

" IT'S A START ! "
So has anyone here ever ingested any . . .
This isn't a bad thing , T - Rex !
You're always all , " Feelings are boring . Kissing is awesome ! " You should make yourself a shirt that says that and wear it all the time .
The great out - of - copyright works of fiction , anyway . My brilliant idea is to completely recontextualize them through the magic of framing stories ! So for example , instead of Moby Dick being about this guy after a whale , it's this CRAZY SCIENTIST writing whaler fan fiction , and at the end , the scientist stops and says " Sheesh , I didn't mean to write so much whaler fan fiction . "
Hey everyone , let's kick up our metaphors a notch , okay ? It's time for 800 - pound gorillas to become 1000 - pound gorillas !
Then I was thinking , maybe I am that !
Exploration of the universe is our first , best destiny and it concerns me that we are putting all of our eggs into one increasingly fragile basket . Let's put some eggs in other baskets ! The baskets are planets , and the eggs , us .

. . . like this ?
No thanks !
In movies people fight skeletons all the time , and nobody every says " Wait , this sword - wielding skeleton used to be inside someone , let's all consider our feelings when I mention that . " Instead they say " Time to BONE UP on my sword - play ! "
See ? I couldn't find " sexplosive " , " mathemagician " , " backne " OR " ambisextrous " !
Hey , what's up ?
DARN IT , YOU'RE RIGHT !
LATER , T - REX IS UPDATING HIS DATING SITE PROFILE :

APPARENTLY SO , because I am the only one selling T - Rex's Patented Organic No - Pill Weight - B - Gone .
Star Trek uses warp technology to speed up their computers , while the Star Wars jerks never apply hyperspace to THEIR compudroids or whatever !
Well ! At least I now know that , EVERY DAY , we can each look ourselves in the mirror and ask , " Are the sum total of my accomplishments today greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub ? "
Many a great work of literature has been written , but until their endings have all sucked !

The genie flipped the heck out . " I grant you 999 , 999 , 999 wishes ! " he said , and then Sherlock dusted off a countertop and the genie said " Fuck it . One trillion trillion billion wishes ! " P . S . I don't know but I guess there are swears in this story ! !

I'm not insulting anyone , I'm just not a fan of live autobio .
Should we tell him ?
Yes ! In all seriousness , it would let me put behind myself aspects of my past that I'm not happy with .
During sexual encounters you shouldn't record things without permission , so initially we'll all squint our cyber eyes shut or wear pirate eye patches during sex . The " one eye squint " look will quickly become eroticized , soon becoming what the " dropped handkerchief " was in the 18th century or the " c00l n00dz " were in the early 21st century !
SOON : THE PLAY IS NOT HILARIOUS OR BEAUTIFUL OR MEANINGFUL AND IT DOESN'T MAKE T - REX RICH BUT IT DOES HAVE AUDIENCE PUNCHING
The only problem is , the book's only super awesome if you already know me , otherwise you won't notice the differences .

Can we talk about what was said earlier
Adults also don't get so wasted that they literally cannot remember what / who they did last night !
Well at least THAT sounds totally awesome to the max !
So , SOMETIMES , archeologists find things that don't belong in their geological contexts : shells where there were no oceans , that sort of thing . And there's lots of explanations like " maybe an animal ate it and pooped it out , GROSS . "

And isn't the experience of sharing music one of it's pleasures ?
T - Rex , you're my friend , but you're -
My new name is " STOP " . Perhaps you've seen my tags at intersections ? I get up .
Because . . . because of Science ?
I'm

God ! I figured I'd as him all the BIG IMPORTANT QUESTIONS that one would ask of God , if one had a chance . Stuff like , how come everybody dies ? How come people judge me because I'd rather remember that my clock is 7 1 / 2 hours slow than set it to the correct time ?
I don't have a kite !
Hah ! God damn , what a couple of clowns .
AND YET
No no , people will love it , I PROMISE .
It doesn't even make sense . If you carbonate a solid the best you're gonna get is a solid with carbon dioxide bubbles in it . And if you've done that you've probably come up with Swiss cheese , so upon closer inspection I think this is a great idea as I would actually like some Swiss cheese , please .
But Spoiler Alert wears a flapper swimsuit when she ruins endings . She can't help but make me money !
" Stories GUARANTEED To be Read Alone , In Silence , With A Fake Cover Over The Book " ! - by me , T - Rex !
Am I crazy ? Is that a crazy sentence to have to say ? ?
No fair ! I was going to ask her to be MY sidekick !
That is accurate and sobering .
Today is the day I bring back the word " daffy " !
Sounds like Batman's winning !
Oh no , so spooky ! !
That's ASTRONOMICALLY unlikely !
Well , it WAS a good party , but are we including all space as well as all time ? We'd have to have partied harder than anyone , EVER , WHENEVER , troughout the entire universe at any point in any timeline . That's a tall order !
Man , don't tell me ! I know I suck at hats ! !
Some day all of this carnage and destruction is going to catch up with you . Perhaps even in the unlikely form of the destruction of our universe , and its replacement with an eerily similar one .
T - Rex , I have good evidence that YOU are an emotional being as well !
I don't know , what ?
Oh my God , I had the best sleep last night . The best sleep ever . It was - it was such a good sleep . Easily , EASILY the best sleep of my life .
Actually . . . I have been dabbling in genetics and was wondering what a group of alleles is called .
Excuse me , sir : this is a black tie dinner , and you've shown up completely naked .
Why are you talking like that ?
September is coming , and that means BACK TO SCHOOL !
I am writing the best story ever ! In it , I simply APPROPRIATE a popular novel , and then place its author in a generalized version of its premise ! THEN , the author has eerily familiar , but thoroughly modernized , adventures .
Man , you had all these interesting true facts , and then you throw in the made up holiday of ? Chinese Christmas ? .
Hah hah , just kidding !
Oh , um , let's say the average person has a detective sense of 1 , and a highly trained detective can develop their detective senses to . . . say , 100 ?
That's not what happens in the story ! !
Those are kinda hard to type !
( IMPLICATION : " Then I'd have more money ! " )
And I don't want to give up touch , because then I'd be bumping my body into spikes and BARELY EVEN NOTICING . Taste wouldn't be too bad , but I'd miss tasting tasty things ! I think it would have to be smell , assuming that wouldn't impact taste ! .
Well . you could always have kids by donating sperm !
What ? ? ? ? You only went back three days !
I take it from your glum demeanor that your ill - advised foray into time - travel destroyed yet another reality ?
Nope ! He said " DUDE FILL IN FOR A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL "
I call this story , " Good Lord , I Hope I Never Get Old " .
I have noticed that eating different foods has different physiological effects on myself . There must be some 'balanced diet' that maximizes the agreeable effects of such nourishment !
What ? ! How so ?
He's soon overcome by the terrible sensation of drowning on dry land : any air that touches his lungs is being transmuted on contact into tiny flecks of gold . He suffocates and dies as his lungs fill with the formerly precious metal .
That's funny , because at least I have thoughts !
Maybe I'll expect a new format of rebuttal from you next time !
Oh craaaaaaaaaaa -
IS MY NEW NIGHTMARE
Because faith is something I don't really have , it's sort of like a sandcastle , right ? And I don't want to be the guy that goes around kicking other people's sandcastles . Even if they thank me afterwards ! Faith is something rare , at least for me , and I'd hate to take it away from someone else .
Do it , T - Rex !
So if I want to remember something I still have to make room by deleting some old memory , but at least I'll be able to choose which one ?
{ { so uh , is she a gold digger or what } }
Dudes , I think the universe is LOLLING at us
I've been thinking about time travel lately !
Yes , and I answered about rats . This is but one more . . . MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE ?
Shoot , you're right ! Oh man . . .
TANKSGIVING
BUT T - REX YOU GET TO FLY IN SPACE WHERE THERE'S NO SOUND
Why do ghosts hate slavery ?
There's no happily ever after for the TRUTH , Utahraptor .
Maybe you met while intoxicated and both forgot !
GOD DOES WANT GODLY SANDWICHES T - REX
Please ! Nothing so distasteful !
Luckily , everything else in the universe has shrunk to the same scale !
Hah , that's only if you don't use birth control ! If every time I had sex a baby came out , I would have SIGNIFICANTLY more babies , Dromiceiomimus . I don't wanna brag , but I'd have , like , over FIVE babies .
Well , how did you make friends the first time ?
Here is a startling thought : what if the things I believe in are wrong ?
Yes . I will be honest with you : I am new to this " band " thing .
So are you going to go ? You are their neighbour , after all !
I - I assumed it was spam because of all the spelling mistakes and because the guy's name was " Boorishly P . Foundry " ! But - hmm . . .
What nerve !
After several years of study I think it is safe to say that I have a firm grasp on the nature of reality !
I wrote Star Trek fan fiction in which we saved the Enterprise and got married !
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS TRANSMITTED AND WHAT IS RECEIVED an allegorical comic and comic allegory
Uh , OBJECTIVE CRITERIA OF GREATNESS ? ?
And it's such a personal thing too . People get upset when you tell them you think they're DATING the wrong person - how do you tell them you think they're creating life with the wrong person ?
Except if you're bitten by a vampire you become a vampire , so all the zombies would eventually become vampires .
From now on , Utahraptor will be known only as " Utahraptore " !
Land ownership doesn't work that way ! There's separate mining and airspace rights .
Spring shares its name with a strange coil of metal . . . and I DON'T KNOW WHY !
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SUPERMAN IS REAL !
TWO YEARS LATER :
I think I agree , T - Rex ! This is the worst kind of kissing and telling .
OH CRAP I FORGOT ABOUT EVIL PEOPLE'S GUT FLORA
Does she bite anyone she knew from before ? Like , her kids maybe ?
AND HIS OTHER FRIEND
So , um , when you look back on this , I hope you realize that the reason I left is your phrase " let us . . . talk about LITERAL rape , okay ? ? " .
. . . I didn't read the book .
MEANWHILE , IN THE PAST :
See what I'm doing , Dromiceiomimus ? I'm making it so that every sad person in the sound of my voice will now try really hard to be happy , so that they can be super ultra cool !
Sounds like a real thrill ride !
So she knew EVERYTHING ?
T - Rex , this is not life - threatening !
YES . All roads there are called " Hell Road " . One thing's for sure : navigating there must be annoying as . . .
And then Moriarty crash - lands there and tries to take over : the only criminal on a planet of crime - fighters ? Yes . Oh GOD yes .
Rex : this is awesome
You have my assurances !
So ! . . . Are there any universal mysteries you'd like explored , Dromiceiomimus ?
T - REX'S THREE LAWS OF PARTIES
who would win in an all - guys game of soccer baseball :
If I get married , we have to play " Earth Angel " as the first dance , okay ?
You're an enormous dinosaur with fangs and claws !
A FEW DAYS LATER THE RASH GETS WORSE :
And pants ?
ALTERNATE ENDING :
I'm bringing it back ! Come on ! Let's go find out how bogus dying is ! !
Little does the Dromiceiomimus know that I intend to show her the great vistas of the world , and by doing so , make her fall in love with me !
THON NOT KNOW BUT THON KNOW IT WHEN THON SEE IT .
I liked it .
A VAST MERCILESS HELL OF PERMANENT AND IMMEDIATE DANGER
Correct !
" Utah " ?
So ! He was so wrong .
Geez , sorry !
Those who survived , either by crashing into a lake OR through store awnings , now face a World Without Rotation ! Half the planet sits in six months of daylight while the other shivers through night , but their main problem isn't even that ! When the planet stopped spinning yesterday , oceans sloshed onto land , and today , THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING BACK .
. . . Alright . Today I somehow leveled up my racism like infinity times .
I guess so . But different ! Everybody I know gets to write one chapter , and they don't see what other people wrote until the book is published !
YOU , UM , GET BORED
T - Rex , it's just a number on a website .
I think it's starting to affect . . .
I've got two words for you , self !
So , um . . . I guess I'll talk to you later huh
" Waah , I'm a big baby who can't handle things that don't literally already exist ! "
T - REX I HAVE BEGUN TO EMPLOY NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS IN LIEU OF ACTUAL LETTERS IN ONLINE ENCOUNTERS
Besides , I like my women like I like my databases !
TO THE FUTURE CRIMINAL TEENS WHO ARE READING THIS FROM NSIDE A COMPUTER
But you do admit you don't have control over the entire universe , right ?
I think you may be doing something wrong if your kisses remind people of amniotic fluid , T - Rex !
You've never been prank phone called before ?
I'm putting them in SERIES .
Dude , rich people LOVE to give people money when they make them laugh ! And I'm going to track down Patrick Stewart and make him laugh SO HARD . You don't even know .
I wish for more wishes !
Success ! !
This is depressing . Turn to panel 4 .
When something's about 10 meters away all the speeds match up perfectly , and it's the only time your brain gets a break from constantly LYING TO YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE ! !
In the end , make sure the love you take is equal to the love you make ?
EVEN THE VEGANS
And ? Why IS a raven like a writing desk ?
Hah had , yeah man !
Apparently , you are ! And the secret is this : when I lost my virginity , I had the song " Tubthumping " by Chumbawamba stuck in my head the entire time . I just really liked the song . I remember being afraid I would hum it afterwards !
But " regret index " makes it sound more scientific . I honestly think this could be useful ! You could find out how many people are still happy that they memorized every Star Trek episode !
PFFT .
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS : WELL , MAYBE THIS IS THE DEAL
T - REX TRIES TO GET AS WORKED UP ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE , BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO THE MALL :
Everyone knows it !
THESE two guys hated each other due to their fundamentally differing ideologies !
* sigh *
And so on , Utahraptor !
Has this technique ever solved ANY of your problems , T - Rex ?
So did I just find a cure for the stress of the modern world or what ?
Add small tasks so that accomplishment is EASY
And yet , I'm not laughing !
The prank giver ( usually me ) has become the prank receiver ( me again ) ! !
The faster you go , the slower time moves for you relative to a motionless observer !
Wait , I've been here before . . . it's the Tyrone residence ! Mr . Tyrone is arguing with his sons again . . .
But in a METAPHORICAL sense .
But you have tasted your own body ! I'm sure you've licked your fingers before .
These are fertile camping grounds my friend .
I used to be against people who left their Christmas lights up on their houses all year long . It was lazy , I said !
OH MY GOSH THAT FINALLY EXPLAINS WHY MY INTERNET IS SO SLOW !
There's no shame in that !
SCIENCE TACT : you are covered in ants . They move to the other side when you look at your body so you can't see them , but their chitinous bodies blanket you .
T - REX HAS PUBLISHED A BOOK OF BIOGRAPHIES
Maybe Original characters are dumb and I hate them ? ?
Don't you take a day off ? Quit stomping on things !
YEP !
THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE . I used IMAGINATION to see what happens next ! We defeated the kids using punches , and then you were secretly one kid on another kid's shoulders wearing a Utahraptor suit , so I had to punch you too !
All it took was a single first - time spellcaster to lose control , and retaliation by equally unskilled fairies took care of the rest . The few who survived did so only by chance . And those survivors decided to forever hide all evidence of magic . They choose water as the tool of their repentance !
And let us not forget this year's lifetime achievement winner , Edna Q . Yellowpages !
Yep ! And I'm glad you said " mot juste " and didn't just write it down as text , as I'd have read it as " mott just - ee " .
But what about important vehicles , like ambulances and so on ?
" I love the taste of chocochops ! " & # 8212 ; T - Rex ?
It was pretty okay ! His rhymes were moderately tight , too !
I'm a Dromiceiomimus .
When a scandal forces its founder , Jill Harka , from the lap of luxury and into the street , she's left with nothing but the clothes on her back , her wits , and her iron will . Now she must clear her family name while unraveling the conspiracy behind her fall . From the team behind Harka : Hostile takeover comes the all - new Harka : Vagrant .
T - REX LOVES YOU AND HE'S GOING TO PROVE IT . TONIGHT HE'S GOING TO EAT TOO MUCH DINNER AND THEN GO TO BED EARLY . THEN YOU'LL KNOW .
Anyway , point is , I can write a sadder story . OBSERVE : " For sale : sucky baby , never loved " . Done and done !
HOLLAAAAA
So light behaves like both a particle and a wave , right ? And I can hit dudes with particles . Is there nothing stopping me from making a light cannon , which , when fired , throws dudes up against the wall ?
Uh , a watery hole ?
" Thank you for being a friend . Travelled down the road and back again . Your heart is true : you're a pal and a confidant . " Aww , what a nice card you made , T - Rex !
Listen
But that's the thing ! Even if I write about something implausible , folks assume there's a real - life inspiration !
Your friend should be less jealous ! There is nothing wrong with friendship , and you should tell your friend to be less jealous . Yes - this problem is truly solved , thanks to logic !
I CAN'T EVEN GET RICHARD THE THIRD TO MOVE . You know what my game is now ? My game is NIBBLES , with the text changed from " Copyright Microsoft 1990 " to " man , forget this "
We all know about your plans now ! If you ever do develop voice talent , we'll all be totally prepared for your little prank calls .
But if they can't verify something , what do they do ?
And no doubt turning what's clearly a global disaster into a chance for sex with multiple partners !
One day , T - Rex the handsome dinosaur was out for a walk .
What the hell ? ! That was my idea !
What do you mean , " And then what " ? And then I'm going to read a bunch of startlingly accurate predictions about our futuristic society !
There's plenty of guys named " Bob " , but I can still float in a volume of water without everyone suddenly reminiscencing about those dudes !
That's good too !
Where'd you pick up a word like " autodidacticism " ?
So in an effort to trip countably fewer balls , I have been researching how my brain works .
They describe such a scenario as " nice " !
" IF ONLY THIS WAS A PROBLEM THAT COULD BE SOLVED WITH A TIME MACHINE "
ADVEN -
Then take the critical consensus !
Maybe I should get some laser THIGH surgery !
And there , seemingly abandoned , they find something we left behind !
And if I'm an adult and I re - read a book I loved as a child , I'll get different things out of it when I read it again as an old man . Even if I'm the author of the text , my reactions to it will be different ! I know this because I remember my high school essays were AMAZING , but when I read them now , SOMEHOW , they're pages and pages of ultimate embarrassment .
You've changed your life significantly ! Man , way to go !
Dentists are totally CYBERNETICISTS .
PFFFFFT
TOPLESS
Two dinosaurs of any gender enter the ring - one dinosaur of any gender leaves !
They're like , bibles and whatever !
A lot of my friends are having babies .
WHAT WHAT I AM IN HELL AND THAT IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD
Talking up the word bicurious again ?
And when people do compliment me on my classiness , I'll shake their hand !
Alright ! Now nobody we care about is sad !
Eating's gross ; NOBODY DO IT
Answer : LET'S FIND OUT , DICKWEEDS
What ? No they're not !
Would you say . . . " The only winning move is not to play ? "
I think you should resolve to be less obsessed about grammar !
Here is what I propose : you record yourself whenever you kiss a woman for the first time , and then when you're old , you edit them all together . A lifetime of work will lead to a memorable result !
FAR - FETCHED ? ?
The Mayans tried to warn us ! !
NEW TLDS THAT ARE NEEDED
Hello . You've all done something you can never legally take back .
THE QUEST : someone left a thing somewhere and someone else goes to get the thing . It's like an RPG fetch quest , but instead of doing it , you have to read !
WHY DO WE DRIVE ON A PARKWAY AND PARK ON A DRIVEWAY ?
huh ?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE !
what is the hold up
I'll probably just eat a chicken for dinner .
I think I'm becoming racist against taxi drivers !
Utahraptor ! We meet again , sooner then usual !
I've a long road ahead of me , it would seem
So . . . do you like comics ?
I never metaproblem I didn't have !
English has been blessed by many ways to say " I say , that is a thing that is hot " . But sometimes it can be hard to remember where each expression ranks in terms of relative hotness ! But check it out :
So you suspect -
Assuming immunity works like in the movies ! And also assuming that , rather than swallowing the poison , I just rub it all over my teeth .
Seriously , though .
They CAN be fun , yes !
. . . I guess . It's also a lot of fun ! And ALL games have limits : there's no baseball outside the diamond . The game just ends . You're not supposed to go there .
Now you've done it . Now you're looking to spend HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS on a single object . This is like spending all this money on ? I don't know , a cookie . Only , you can't eat your cookie , and when you're not looking your cookie can BURN DOWN . Oh ! And your cookie is SO EXPENSIVE that the time you'll take to pay back the loan you'll need to buy even a tiny cookie is routinely measured in DECADES .
Falling in love , that sort of thing !
Only so many characters can splash around in a swimming pool at the same time . And they keep bumping into each other !
" Nintendo , I just . . . I JUST WISH I HAD A SISTER YOU COULD MARRY . "
If I agree that doesn't mean i have to produce it though right ?
The olive garden !
There are worse things to happen that a video game not coming out , T - Rex !
And I wouldn't be able to follow you because that would make ME seem needy and insecure .
IT WAS A STYLISTIC CHOICE !
Hey , how are those giant brains working out for you guys ?
I suspect that you have , because it's totally true !
Let's say I want my room to be at a comfortable , yet classy , 22 degrees celsius . If I design a system that repeatedly checks the temperature of the room and either turns on a heater or an air conditioner as needed , then OH SNAP . I'VE JUST BUILT A CYBERNETIC SYSTEM .
You're right ! The infection would spread quickly and nearly invisibly ! And mosquitoes already want blood , so it's not like they need THAT much encouragement to become zombies . Man !
Today I've been operating under the assumption that when you talk to a T - Rex ( such as myself , you understand ) - everyone's a winner !
Screaming doesn't fix the problem , it just draws attention to your bruisey foot . And when your scream is followed by cursing , THAT just says " My foot hurts now , and I believe this is equivalent to poo . "
I know ! I'm trying to collect on the insurance money !
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE !
That analogy kinda - needs to let people know that I've got some opinions !
Oh crap , has it been four years ? That means World Cup Football has started again ! And THAT means it's time for . . .
Except her phone requires a precise , sustained 150mA AC voltage and she had no idea how to generate that . So instead she threw her phone in a bog , confident that when it was discovered centuries from now it'd BLOW EVERYONE'S MIND . Then she , I don't know , farted around for a bit and died of plague .
I don't like when they encounter something amazing in Engineering or wherever and call up to the bridge and say " Captain , you'd better get down here . " Explain what it is ! THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DO . I don't call up my friends and say , " Utahraptor , you'd better get down here . " and he ways " Why ? " and I say " Oh Utahraptor , if only we had descriptive language ; if only I could describe something using my words . But you know as well as I that I can only point and say , lookit . "
I couldn't invent penicillin because I don't know what mold is used , but I could do stuff with electricity ! Like . . . magnetically levitated trains ? Oooh , and electric fly swatters !
Wow , that's a big number , huh ?
" AWARD - WINNING "
First : Annoying your opponent doesn't mean you've won . Second : You can't " win " a friendship . It's not a competition . There are no winners or losers .
Here's brain teaser for your face ! AND your brain inside your face !
And then we had dinosaur sex !
BUT HOW TO PROFIT FROM IT ?
North inspects the carnage .
That's gross and confusing !
Can we accept that there will always be some unstable people who will go off with any stimulus , and that others can't be held responsible ?
Hi , T - Rex .
I'm ready . Amaze me .
Now class , you may be angry and confused , but you should strive to rise above these instincts . Albert Einstein wasn't angry and confused ! He was smart and only angry SOMETIMES .
Friiiiiig !
Okay . But it's gross ! I was riding my bike and I accidentally - - I'm sorry , this is disgusting . There was a dead mouse on the side of the road , and it was bloated and had obviously been there for a while , and by the time I noticed it , it was too late to avoid . I ran over it and it burst and some of it flew up and landed on my lips .
I have been trying , UNSUCCESSFULLY , to write a poem for the past half hour . I am trying to capture the emotion of getting up early in winter , during a heavy snowfall , and going for a walk and coming across a set of traffic lights ( the kind that switch automatically ) controlling traffic that isn't there , traffic that won't be there for hours . The sense of seeing them as art , of watching them through the snowfall in the crisp dusk of a new day .
CHICKEN FLAVOUR
SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION !
PLEASE SAY YES
And Gladwell will tell you the more time you spend working on something the better you get at it : this means that older ghosts that kill ghosts would get really great at killing ghosts ! They'd - they'd LEVEL UP .
Wow , the Antitime , with the full power to reverse time ! will you please turn my grandmother in to a young woman again ?
And it is always true .
The 'k' indicates extra kraziness , Dromiceiomimus .
Yeah , you can do that too .
I KNOW YOUR DREAMS LAST NIGHT THAT WERE SO BORING EVEN YOU FORGOT THEM ALREADY
I'd better go gather the ingredients !
But T - Rex , what if time travel is not just hard , but impossible ? If time travel is possible , where are all the tourists from the future ?
If I ever turn into a werewolf , I would DEFINITELY donate my still - living body to science ! The reason is simple : I Care About Science .
That's our Google !
They can be dogs ! !
Did you & # 8212 ;
And actually I think that sounds really nice ? ?
" Duhhh , I don't know how cold fusion works and whenever my body dies my consciousness dies as well ! ! "
Y - You don't -
Here is a joke about dinosaurs : What makes more noise than one dinosaur ?
If you knew about it all this time why did you keep it a big secret
I ALSO thought they were just trying to get out of eating their kale !
Y - yes ?
They ignore your screams .
Oh , they still pull over to let those through . They just don't let cars merge in with the bikes because it's DANGEROUS .
T - Rex , I'd hoped I'd never say this , but ? you've let me down !
MEANWHILE , FORTY YEARS IN THE FUTURE !
Could we engineer dogs that smell colours ?
I don't see how this engenders effective communication .
It's very . . . biological .
There's all these really interesting and amazing people out there : people who know so many awesome things and DO so many awesome things that I'm like , " HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE ? "
You can transform complex carbohydrates into kinetic energy .
The Walk of Shame is when you're coming home in the same clothes you partied in last night . You spent the night somewhere else , maybe you had sexy times , and therefore you're to be ashamed !
Because he's going to bang her on the coffee table later ! YES ! THAT WAS THE JOKE . Okay , thanks Utahraptor . I'm going to go back in time to do it right .
What was ?
American history : NOT SO BORING NOW , AM I RIGHT ? ?
Those are good choiced ! I'ma add " Good Grief ! Even More Controversial Opinions on Paedophilia " to my list .
CAUTIONARY TALE COMIX
You guys , I also carry a cane with a skull on the top and wear a jacket made of the finest feathers .
Utahraptor ! HELLO ? IT'S A METAPHOR FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ? ?
And when a genius is pretty sure , that's like ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY for regular folks !
Okay that's a metaphor , but just BARELY . It's basically a literal description of what's going on .
And instead of " exciting " ?
But like , what are they like when they're NOT having sex ?
Bruce Swain , my legally and creatively distinct character , moves to New York City ! And his parents get shot by criminals , so he decides to change his name and fight crime !
You're now totally down with trendy corporate slogans . Or should I say " Trendy . Corporate . Slogans . " ?
Who's making jokes ? I'm not making jokes .
I know , right ? I learnt it from a half cat / half dude dude !
THAT'S EASY ! DINOSAUR COMICS IS A COMIC ABOUT DINOSAURS ! BUT FELLAS WOULD YOU BELIEVE ?
starring lovable , scaly old T - REX
It's greedy . Let's cut it such that there's no other way it could be cut that would make ANY of us better off , without making at least one of us worse off . That's OPTIMAL for all of us , T - Rex , and that's optimal for SOCIETY .
R -
I , as well , am down with fall !
Because now instead of simply saying " hey listen for my tastes you are WAY too sassy " you are saying " hey listen okay there's this all - powerful invisible being who controls EVERYONE'S FATE and he's or she or it or they ( it's hard to say and nobody really agrees ) has got plans and intentions and a particular interest in us NOT being together . "
I let someone cut in front of me for two reasons : because I figure this way it's more likely they'll do the same for me in the future , and because I recognize that it helps the traffic system as a whole . But this isn't generosity , it's greed ! It's well - presented greed . It's me selfishly wanting to get around quickly so BADLY that I'll sacrifice the short term for the long term .
This is one weaksauce discovery , T - Rex !
Blind people !
Last night I ate lots of pears by mistake .
Well , if he's a ghost now , you can still tell him .
Where's Stan during all this ?
In my story there's a new Lolita , and she's thirty , and she goes out with a man who's also thirty and from a similar economic and social background ! They get married and have some okay times . Years later , all the characters die of old age !
Today is Thanksgiving Day !
Man , I totally blew it yesterday with the Utahraptor . Why did I make a joke about his mom ?
Yes , I can't wait to live in a world where adults gets killed by laser blasters and then two days later newborn babies are running around trying to get their come - uppance with other laser blasters .
Their significance cannot be overstated .
You can't spell " selection " without " election " !
That's the colour EVERYONE sees when they close their eyes !
um
You've only got a few seconds left to cover all of the medical sciences !
FANTASY LAND :
Come , then . What reason have you to be morose ? You're rich enough .
Sure do ! But inside they are DEAD .
They implant fillings !
LATER : SOMEBODY ELSE OWNS THE RIGHTS TO JIMMY OLSEN AND CLARK KENT
T - Rex ? You haven't said anything in a few -
What's up , T - Rex ?
That's even MORE badass !
I love you too and I'm glad we're friends . But MAN , I don't love people asking me when I'm going to get married .
The THIRD announcement is that I need to borrow fifty dollars .
Okay ! Wow ! I'm glad that's settled !
. . . I was going to say this is just pantheism again , but living in a house of dead tree gods is something I'm really into , so : OBJECTION WITHDRAWN .
Sometimes , Breadmatic , in my most private moments . . .
Dromiceiomimus ! What are YOU doing here ?
" Yeah , I just found that out . "
These words include such fine examples as " fellows " , " gravy " , and " Monterey Jack " .
Are we to discount these people , though ?
I searched the internet for " is an art " and it turns out translation , leadership , medicine ,
Sure they would !
You're not alone in that !
And I'm STILL not comfortable with the full range of my sexuality , but we all have to make do ! !
THEY WERE MY IDEA
Yeah , finish inventing them and legalize them already . Hey , can you think of a single thing to do that someone hasn't died attempting ?
OR WHEN IT'S COOL TO WEAR A WALKING - AROUND HELMET .
They can be hot as balls .
Listen , okay , you don't have to be taught how to be a ninja TEEN . If you're a ninja and you're a teen , then you're already being a ninja teen ! But working in groups can be a challenge , especially for siblings , and Splinter provided valuable leadership and guidance on that matter and that's what the lyrics are saying . He taught them to be ninja TEAMS .
I know this sounds boring but it ends with EVERYBODY DYING so stay with me !
Not dying ?
Some called them " cliches " , while others called them " stereotypes " - and that's where our words come from ! The stereotype of the sexy T - Rex is analogous to a piece of metal that reads " sexy T - Rex " in reverse , from printers who saved concepts they encountered often .
. . . They were phones that were built into your car .
Sir , we only tattoo skin , not bones .
Secretly , I did punctuate that sentence improperly !
Wow ! He must really have been something in the bedroom , huh ?
Aristotle ! I DON'T SPEAK GREEK
yeah but i don't know a lot of things like this one time i wasn't too good at sports so i had to be a timekeeper but i wasn't too good at that either even though i tried super hard
You ignored my awesome sick burn and in doing so transformed it into . . . the setup for a time - travelling adventure ? I gotta say , I'm impressed !
That's true ! Luckily , as I say , this has never happened to me . Therefore , double high fives for conflict avoided ? ?
The perfect length !
Motorcycle enthusiasts enjoy " souping up " their rides almost as much as anime fans enjoy the classic " Battle Angel Alita " graphic novels !
T - Rex ! Don't stomp on her ! God damn it , I'm so sick of telling you not to stomp on things !
That's it !
What's that ? GOD wanted it to be that way ?
Now I'm not saying she's a gold digger /
So turn around !
Say " goodbye " to your house , Dromiceiomimus ! If you don't like it , you can LODGE a complaint . . . with my foot !
Today I propose a word meaning " extremely sad , but also extremely amazing " . It can be hard to pull off that emotion ; you don't want people thinking you're TOO into how amazing it was . But if you say , " I'm very [ my new word ] right now " , everyone understands ! Grief has become easier to navigate !
" Despite that , they were about to have some sexy times when suddenly an unknowable sickly shambling horror of shifting alien geometry showed up . It was SO spooky ! Antonio got pretty scared , I gotta say . Later on the shambling horror left and Antonio Tony and Louisa Q got sexy times again . Now it was SO erotic ! "
" the / this / a / your / you " , " wonderful / amazing / valuable / free / proven " , " new / enhanced / improved / guaranteed " , " service / product / lifestyle " , " that / which " , " now / greatly / somehow / always " , " saves / simplifies / complicates / meddles in " , " every / your society's / your children's / Grandma's " , " cooking / bedroom / office / cellar / beachhouse " , " performance / results / love / money / sex / career " !
Well , I guess the fact that you DON'T still know any Beths is actually our . . . BETH case scenario ?
Does anybody else find foods that are heavy in protein , salts , and fats to be delicious ?
Looks like I'm still the world authority on myself , everyone ! Go ahead !
Hey , what's so sensual about pretzels ?
So how's it work ?
In that case , I would advise them to meet women on the Internet .
Twenty seconds later , the longstanding friendship was over .
I'M NOT BITCHES
This was bad enough before you could talk , mosquitos !
You know what ? She's right ! I should memorize these things .
THOSE ANIMALS FREAK ME RIGHT THE HECK OUT
That's what S -
I am too . I think this will be the best TEAM ESSAY ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FRIENDSHIP IN EARLY EASTERN LITERATURE ever !
Except who " they " are in any precise way but oh well ! !
Plus , this was Eden ! LITERAL PARADISE . We don't have to limit ourselves to the fruits we know !
Are you having trouble thinking of spooktacular ways to make Hallowe'en special for your kids , aged 4 to 17 ?
Maybe the sender of this card knows every time it happens because it's like a radio broadcast they can't turn off , only the radio is broadcasting moans and groans and " I'm sorry " s and " Bombs away ! " s .
What else could it be ? Is someone breaking into my house just to drink my milk ? I don't really mind , I guess - I'd just like to know .
It's not that big a problem .
Yes , Utahraptor : I have gone all over 2000 years and found the global minimum : the exact day when North American , and indeed , world culture reached its , um , opposite of zenith .
Depends on who you ask , dude !
When you watch TV you yell " It'd be SUPER AMAZING if the two leads were always about it kiss and then someone knocks on the door , or one of them says 'we can't' and bites their knuckle ! " That could be us !
Turn to panel 5 .
For the first time ever these " social " sciences can become true hard - core sciences : we'll be able to do EXPERIMENTS . Go back in time to an interesting economic situation and see how different solutions work ! We'll finally be able to control initial conditions !
BETTER EVEN THAN DR LEONARD MCCOY OR BONES FOR SHORT
You don't wear glasses !
I think that's already done . I think that's called " rehearsal " .
It sounded like a good idea !
THERE'S A REASON WE KEEP THEM SEPARATED , EVERYONE
SCRABBLE AS SHE IS PLAYED
He - she's right !
Man , if I use it often enough it will be ! It's just not well - known YET .
Why , the circle wipe !
UTAHRAPTOR , you said you'd get this under control ! !
On second thought , " head sex modesty hat " sounds real interesting so I'LL OFFICIALLY ALLOW THIS .
Mary Magdalene ?
Wish fulfillment
Yeah , dude wants to bring back these olde - timey amusements , but it's like - too late , Chad ! I've seen a movie ! Therefore I can no longer enjoy staring at a painting while whispering " whee ! " , you know ?
Oh man ! GROSS !
WAIT ! Before you answer you should know that this will only work if we have compatible sexual orientations !
I bet he would !
Why , yes , it would !
Save us from the monsters we have created and were foolish enough to think we could control !
What's the deal with people who quote other people all the time ?
Unless , of course , the threat actually exists . . .
It simplifies things , plus it includes a flat tax , which a lot of amateur economists AS WELL AS even some real economists like !
I've never seen you solve problems with your fists either , actuall !
" CREDIT CARD FRAUD "
Don't you think you're being kind of overzealous ?
AHA MY FRIEND BUT WHEN PRECISELY DID IT SWITCH FROM HEAP TO NON - HEAP
Utahraptor ! When I die I get an award for " Most Opportunities Missed " and nobody claps ! !
Then prepare for my amazing " Vampire Novel 2000 " !
Look , sorry for admitting I was wrong , I guess ?
And in response to a nice butt , instead of shouting " Hey baby is your butt an altered deck of cards because that ass is STACKED , " try shouting " Hey baby I do hereby and solemnly swear to focus inward on bettering myself so that I might one day live up to my potential ! ! "
And don't freak out , but IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME , YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE . Only , in real life when you die in the game you just don't get a point . So , you're good .
I don't believe in karma !
It WAS a great way to get to know you better !
Why are we still talking about horses ?
This is not the first time this has happened !
Am I right ?
Wait ! Wait a minute ! I never had a chance to use it for real !
BUT SECRETLY :
Bridges are women in German and men in Spanish !
Now when you walk around the school / you just might chance to see
No , in the real story Perseus chops Medusa's head off and she's pregnant by Poseidon so babies pop out of her neck . One is a giant with a solid gold sword and the other is Pegasus .
I wear a top hat and monocle
Maybe ! I guess I look at people with real responsibility and wonder if maybe it'd be nice , and if I'm being - left behind ? I don't know ? I never wanted to be Canonically Adult before !
Haven't we gone over this before ? Declaring yourself to be angry doesn't excuse personal responsibility , T - Rex !
STORIES FOR WOMEN
You said your catchphrase ! Every time you say " WHAT " some goofy music plays , so the audience knows when to laugh and applaud !
T - REX DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE MOST POPULAR WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
Nope , cause then you could be killed by an old guy ! This machine delights in ironically vague deaths .
I've been to like two weddings in my life , but I've seen them portrayed in media thousands of times ! Is it SO WRONG to incorporate elements of these media portrayals into my own expectations ? ?
I'd PREFER that !
. . . Right . Well , before we go let me write in my diary !
today's technique : CHEKHOV'S GUN
According to my map of the yellow woods , this road diverges here .
And the whole book is this alternate T - Rex writing about how his life has gone so far !
But guys ! I still totally want to be a stand - up comedian !
And I assure you it will be . . . SUPER excellent ?
Hmmm .
Chekhov's gun is when you have something conspicuously introduced early on in the story , but which doesn't become important until later on ! It happens whenever Shakespeare loudly mentions how he loves Pop Tarts , and later he eats a bunch of Pop Tarts !
Our current understanding will have to be UPDATED , pending my success !
It's such a little thing to weep , so short a thing to sigh ; And yet by trades the size of these We men and women die ! - Emily Dickinson
Anyway , he returned to Earth years later , ready to be a superhero . Unfortunately his first mission was to save technicians from a nuclear meltdown , during which he himself became SEVERELY irradiated , as toxic as actual nuclear waste . He returned to the moon , along .
DRAAAAMAAAAA
It seems that all your stages of fashion involve stomping .
You guys , too many songs are sad ! ! You may quote me .
You were WRONG , bro !
Ah , so there's nothing she can do .
Concluding Myth week , we have the story of Pan , Midas's Friend Who Wasn't The Best At Music ! You might remember him as " Flute Guy " ? Anyway , this is his very last story . This is the story of the DEATH of a GOD . This is . . .
Okay , so everyone knows about making margins wide and using a big font , but teachers know that one too . They see it and they think " Come on , you can do better , " and then they uncap their red pens and write " You could use some friggin' tips ! " all over your cover page .
Oh my god , your name .
What's the matter ?
I heard it was somebody's birthday today . . .
One day an alive woman died ! THE END .
I like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own product centric lyrics . It's a window into an alternate corporate - controlled universe !
When people say they are looking for God , they do not mean it literally !
Air gets boring ! Who here is bored with air ; keep breathing air if you're bored with air .
Good ol' Mr . Tusks !
But it's also kind of awesome !
Yaaay !
In one terrible moment , the ghost appeared to everyone on the planet . Most animal life is now dead , except for the sleeping and the blind . Eastern nations are waking up to a world half empty .
I'm not hotted out by women who continue to wear high heels while getting increasingly naked .
It should have one of those accelerometers or whatever in it , so it can charge itself from my motions throughout the day !
Let us see how that goes , Utahraptor !
Sounds like she doesn't exist to me !
It's way better than spending it on making the world a better place -
So when I send a message to Past T - Rex , he'll act on it - and that'll change the universe that I , Present T - Rex , live in ! So presumably now I'd send a different message back in time , which will again change how past T - Rex acts . We've got an unstable loop of constantly changing timelines , but it SHOULD proceed towards an equilibrium !
Aha ! But I can't VERIFY that my senses are liars , nor can I verify that I'm a brain in a jar ! How does THAT taste , Utahraptor ?
You share a cultural context with other Mario fans , so there's your shibboleth to talk with them directly . At the same time , Mario is famous enough that nobody will be lost by a reference !
Hey , remember when email used to be fun and getting a new email was a joy ?
naked people
Most of Shakespeare's life is a mystery ! People spend their time reading his plays and saying " Man , this guy has dudes sailing from cities that are days away from large bodies of water . "
Dromiceiomimus , should I stomp this house FAST , or should I stomp this house SLOW ?
Then don't go back to sleep ! You could easily have another dream that lasts that long - maybe even longer !
No it's not .
That - that doesn't work as well .
What about us ? !
I don't know either , but I would hope they'd work on curing diseases while in there !
IS MARIO PARTEE
I say I am not !
This -
There are probably others , whom you may never meet , but who have even greater skill than you !
J'aime des choses et d'autres choses !
P . P . S . SORRY NOT SORRY
Okay ! What'll the word be ?
Appropiate !
Here's me speaking modern English : " Let's go see a movie the day after tomorrow . "
Ako obichash !
I will do that , but ONLY if you pay me .
T - Rex , what I am about to say , I say with all honesty .
Watson's attention was directed to his notebook .
That's - That's pretty much where we are right now .
Bro !
The six things I could never live without
Oh man , I'm sorry !
Plus you can mess up cooking real easy
Excellent ! Go , circulatory system !
Depends . Have you ever called me " lovely " before ?
Ho ho ! Did you catch the comedy there ? There are two meanings in that phrase ! If you don't get it , don't worry - the key to emulating understanding is often just to repeat the last word or phrase . Fake a laugh , say " Hah ! TIRED . " and you will be SET .
OH MY GOD I THINK IT IS
He filed his taxes on time , but ONE DAY , the government mailed him and was like , " Dude you need to file taxes for the past five years " and the dude was like " DUDES I ALREADY TOTALLY DID " and the government guy was like " Hah hah , our mistake ! " but then their computers kept mailing him threatening " pay your taxes " letters and he felt like the problem would never be fixed and it caused him a lot of stress THE END .
That came up all the time ?
What -
No , please be my guest !
Constant hunger has robbed me of all identity .
AS IT HAPPENS , in some areas gambling is heavily regulated , but bingo is a special case that isn't . And so companies have built electronic bingo machines , exactly as I envisioned ! Whats more , some have used bingo as an engine to power other types of gambling , like poker and slot machines . The game plays a hidden bingo game , and if you get a bingo , your slots will ALWAYS come up as three cherries . It's nuts ! Bingo's being used in ways GOD NEVER INTENDED .
It's especially impressive after I tell you that one in seven Canadians is . . . A SENIOR CITIZEN ! !
IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A COMPELLING FORM OF ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
{ { thinking } } Why do they call it " lactose intolerant " ? They should call it , " lactose inconsiderate " .
Instead he embarked on a career as a SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHER and made a lot of money duping a lot of people , including Abraham Lincoln's widow . Only , peopleeventually started to notice that his " ghosts " looked an awful lot like living people around town !
Hold the phone ! ! !
We don't know how - or where - they report their findings . All we DO know is our children have been . . . modified by them . Experiments show even children raised in tropical climates spontaneously begin manifesting golems when exposed to snow . They say it's " fun " .
The commercial spaceflight industry is growing quickly , and there's a chance - small , but non - zero - that spaceflight will become affordable before you die .
Am not ! !
They were a constant threat to everyone around them ! They were known to destroy human property with impunity !
Looks like my April Fool's day just opened up
To a large extent , T - Rex , it actually DOES matter what other people think about you . If 6 , 999 , 999 , 999 people on the planet think you'e a monster and you think you're great , who should we trust ? The single outlier , or the LITERAL vast majority of sentient life on this planet ? ?
Smell associations !
YOU ARE DESCRIBING A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE T - REX ASK ME IF I EVER GET TIRED OF OF BEING RIGHT ALL THE TIME
Here's one for you T - Rex ! A beautiful human woman has sex with Vin Diesel .
Discuss !
T - REX'S FRIDGE GOT GROSSER AND EVENTUALLY HE THREW IT OUT AND BOUGHT A NEW ONE
because they are never going to be born .
This domain name will have to be something that reflects me and my interests !
For a second there , I thought that GOD HIMSELF had wrecked our party , but nope ! NOT THIS TIME , ladies !
I can't believe the Utahraptor's a smoker ! I can't believe it !
Hah , okay , that was pretty good . But work it into your regular rotation of minced oaths , pseudo - profanities and cusses ! Don't just replace everything wholesale . Tomorrow I'm sure there'll be some new phrase you'll be enamoured with .
I'm not going to enjoy it with you when you stole all my cookies , you scallywag !

I've played Rock Paper Scissors for sex .
Now that he is gone I can freely admit that there never was a bomb . I just wanted an excuse to stomp !
T - REX WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE COLOR
That's crazy ! Nobody thought to own it ? I'll express further surprise right after I announce that I hereby claim the moon in the name of me ,
Whoah ! Suddenly you are extremeley classy !

Anybody want to trip balls today ? Because I am willing to TRIP BALLS . I am willing to trip ALL the balls .
They're great because say you love a particular hip hop song , but wouldn't you love it EVEN MORE if it was an opera ? Yes , you would ! Also , wouldn't you love arias ten times better as gangsta rap songs ? Here again , the answer is yes . I don't know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended , but I accept it , and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form !
GREAT NAMES FOR FRUIT
Well , I'd enjoy the cookie and remember you fondly , so there's still self - benefit . Really , all you've done is found a way to escape a hellish post - apocalyptic environment through baking .
Whoah ! Smooth move , Casey ! !
Dromiceiomimus , if you laughed at my jokes more I might feel better about things in general .
The way you say it - is there actually an organization called Beards over Babies ?
Hah hah ! Yep !
SPY CATS , you guys !
The trick , Dromiceiomimus , is NOT to make vegetables fun . Nothing makes vegetables fun except using them as weapons ( carrot swords , etc ) .
Not if I disable your ship first !
It doesn't seem like it : you're always trying to change it to something with more of a punchline to it . But jokes get old ! And if your name's a joke , you'll be the first one to get tired of it .
" I have smelly pants . " & # 8212 ; Utahraptor .
Yes ! " Benefit " .
Before you tell me , which is better : love or sex ?
Alright ! Hmm . . well - " together you and me could be so special matey " . . .
DROMICEIOMIMUS this is BRAND FANFICTION not BRAND LABOR RECORD EDUTAINMENT CORNER , THANKS .
Man ! How come my high school guidance counsellors never said " Be a sailor , THEY'RE AWESOME " ? Maybe - maybe they wanted all the sailor jobs for themselves ?
Oh , thank goodness .

today's adventure : THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE
Platonic love is not the same thing , Utahraptor .
SPEARS to meet you , Utahraptor ! !
Yeah , I guess ! Or awesome , you know ?
Oooh , she burns me up ! ! ! Only pussies dress up as witches
I know ! HOW AMAZING IS THIS ? ? I definitely need to make a LinkedIn account right away to take advantage of this amazing opportunity ! And yet . . . WHAT IF I FORGET TO ? ?
But that's already implied by the medium itself . I suppose I could take advantage of the " one sentence " policy and compose the longest most complex sentence ever , and pour my heart into it .
T - Rex ? ! What are you doing here ? It's late ! It's 3 AM !
- YES , Dromiceiomimus . YES .
I'm calculating the EXPECTED REAL - LIFE SUPERMAN GENERATION RATE .
Natural language processing researchers are all , " Oh boo hoo , computationally generating and understanding natural language is hard , we totally need more time to build Data from Star Trek , boo hoo hoo ! "
Clearly the only ethical thing to do with superpowers is fight crime .
Yeah , but - talking animals ! Why doesn't he do that all the time ? We could chat up EVERY ANIMAL EVER .
I have therefore renamed " Timmy " to " Jimmy Olsen " and " Lassie " to " Clark Kent " !
Man ! See ? I NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET . I'm in over my head ! I need a speech AND I need to pull a bachelor party together on the double ! !
Go ahead , ask me anything . I bet I'll get it wrong !
. . . I mean , it seems likely .
But at least it hasn't happened yet ! !
And you played Scrabble without me ?
Wha ?
Now what you hear is our first test : transmitting on the air ! And me , that Mar - coni guy , is gonna talk from over there !
Making fun of our fundamental flaws , are we ? Classy !
Which of these three titles is best : " Sherlock Holmes vs Sherlock Holmes " , " Sherlock Holmes Unlocks The Secrets of Effective High - Performance MySQL Database Administration " , or " Sherlock Holmes and the Astral Plane ( I Mean The Kind With Wings ) " ?
Neat ! But largely irrelevant to us , as our reproduction is not through vaginal intercourse !
Wait , what was this about me ?
T - REX ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO PUNCH AN ATTACKING BEAR IN THE SOLAR PLEXUS AND THEN HE'LL BEND OVER IN PAIN AND THEN YOU'LL ELBOW HIM IN THE BACK
That's - that's the number I was thinking of ! !
Man , whatever ! I'll just legally name my kid " T - Rex Jr . " and then refer to him exclusively as " Lord Britishface the Third " !
The audience sighs a sigh of relief because this story just got awesome . But then , the car flies off into the distance and we're stuck looking at wheat ! A few minutes pass , and we hear the sound of explosions and laser weapons fire coming from the distance , all " KAPOW " and " pew pew pew " , all " zzzzzot " and kksccchh - POW ! ! ! "
I ended up with EROTICA , Utahraptor . And I felt very off sitting there , writing about two imaginary people THAT I MADE UP having sex with each other .
DUDE THAT'S SUPER CLASSY
One day Sherlock Holmes found the lamp and rubbed it . Like all genies this one loved cleanliness so he flipped out when that one little spot got rubbed clean . The genie appeared and offered to grant Sherlock three wishes , which is kind of a big deal ! All this because one lamp got slightly cleaner . Can you imagine what would've happened if Sherlock vacuumed ?
This just in : you're no longer allowed to talk about holes , EVER .
I can't believe it ! I've played a game you haven't ? !
But let's cut to the chase : can you do a sad TWO - WORD story ?
It's cool to get a good night's sleep !
Then it's time to break out the BIG GUNS .
Try to remember interesting stories about yourself . Having such stories close at hand allows you both to fill in awkward gaps in conversation , and also acts to give people a quick , hopefully representative picture of yourself !
So heteronormative !
THAT'S RIGHT !
Hah ! How regular ?
Yes , except zombies , and THEN only if the books are printed on flesh , which I think limits us to the Necronomicon . Actually , isn't vellum animal skin ?
Hmmm . . . they tasted like regular meat sticks , I guess !
If so , then I propose you join my party , featuring T - Rex ! Whoo !
And these custom - made , perfectly - fit slippers just happen to FALL OFF as she leaves ? ?
How can you POSSIBLY KNOW whether or not I'm BSing or not without researching the field yourself , and then once you know it intimately , emailing me the correct answer ? ?
HELLO
FIRST OFF : whatever ! And second off : what if I died and you wanted pictures ?
I bet that I could be an amazing ballet dancer . In fact . . . yes . Wait . Yes !
T - Rex , you've learnt a lot of horse origins , but I feel the time has come to completely and irrevoc - ably blow your mind . If you'll allow me . . . ?
T - REX HAS JUST FOUND SOME ROTTEN FOOD IN HIS FRIDGE COMICS
. . . or to take arms against a sea of troubles , and , by opposing , end them ?
Next , tell it who your friends are .
Hee hee ! That's it for SCIENCE , bitches !
People will notice I'm always sending the same thing !
Folks who refuse to accept that one quality can easily be a dealbreaker !
THE CORRECT ANSWER HERE IS " YES " , OKAY ? ?
They're opinions about sex !
She tries to , anyway !
INSIDE THE WOMB
Counterpoint ! I drank some recently - expired juice yesterday , and it was exceedingly delicious . The only reason people have such faith in expiry dates if because of the Star Trek TV shows !
It turns out there are some regions where my HyperBingo ( tm ) is played . Neat !

Oh man ! Let's go to the beach and hang out in flattering swimsuits !
I am ! I realized my perfect woman won't say " ew , that's weird " as she watches me eat a whole baguette !
What ? ! I can be romantic ! !
Every time we play chess , you're hoping that I die ! !
How do you figure that ?
T - REX SETTLE A BET
UTAHRAPTOR . His speaking voice sounds like a text - to - speech synthesizer . That is awesome ! That is objectively awesome .
I MADE BRUSSEL SPROUTS TASTE BETTER .
Also : twenty cars on a stick . Sound stages , every library ( individually AND en masse ) , medium - sized cubes that are still pretty big , lakes , beer - flavoured lakes , and beer - flavoured lakes in Minnesota .

Robyn obviously had the screaming skull's blood tested . It turned out to be fresh , disease - free Type O negative blood : the universal donor ! Like that , the world's blood banks would never be empty again .

Dating both twin sisters at the same time :

Ah , the " not wrong but also not meaningfully correct " route !
Okay , suppose I think " I love chocochops " , which are of course delicious chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone . And say there's a twin Earth , completely identical - EXCEPT that there , chocochops have a different chemical makeup , but taste and look the same ! If my twin thinks " I love chocochops " , he's actually referring to the one with CRAZY CHEMICALS , while when I think that , I'm referring to a chemically different object . The environment determines our semantics !
Proprioception !
From now on all you'll get from me is 100 % VERIFIABLE FACTS .
Oh noooo !
Also , nobody's allowed to dress like Draculas or Sexy Draculas for another full year either . We all have to be SENSIBLE now . No pointing out any ghosts you see , alright ? Just look right through them like they aren't there , keep brushing your teeth , go to bed , and BE SENSIBLE . Ignore how you can feel the weight of the ghost on the corner of your bed , and whenever you peek , you see he's moved ever closer , staring with dead , rotting eyes .
Best of luck , unhappy 80s celebrities ! !
Um . . . pretty perfect ?
Hey T - Rex , do you want a hand ? We could do it together !
T - REX RESEARCHES IT ANYWAY :
I will become . . .
Imagine a dude whose life just keeps getting better . He starts out unemployed and feeling useless .
JUST ONE PROBLEM : ( ! ) looks like a butt . It looks as much like a butt as : D looks like a face , which is to say : TOTALLY A LOT .
FRIG , YES , I DID
We usually answer with " nothing " , but I can see better informed but equally jerky people in the future making fun of us for this .
Tickets are not transferable . No one else can travel with this ticket .
One day Poison Ivy was like , what the hell , why am I not the star of the comic ? I am a woman who can control plants I have ACTUAL SUPERPOWERS .
Pay attention , now !
There's this crazy rash I've got on my wrist . This is an unwelcome development that I did not invite !
You're going to have to define that for me , T - Rex !
Don't worry about it , T - Rex !
It isn't ?
Oh right , that ending in way better . Her head gets chopped off and A FLYING HORSE and SWORD GIANT come out . Then end .
Oh no ! Mars bats !
I hope we all learned a lot today !
I need my septic tank cleaned and I want it done ARTISANALLY : by hand , using a little toothbrush .

Okay ! So , we get a couple - no ! - a polyamorous CROWD of people , who all want to have a child , but who are all infertile . So ! Then we get a donated fertilized egg . . .
Man , anyway ! I'll come up with my own incredible challenge .

There's SO MANY children named after blood already . It's weird . I recommend naming the kid after the most bad - ass animal you can think of : " Wolf " , " Raven " , " T - Rex " , and " Phoenix " are all solid options .
My stars , am I ever enamoured with sign language . You can speak with your hands ! That's amazing !

What if I started wearing it under a shirt when I go out ? That way , if I got hit by a car , the discovery of the pin will ENTIRELY OVERSHADOW anything I've ever accomplished in my life !
Come on ! " Justin Case " ? " Justin Time " ? Those are old names that weren't that funny to begin with .
Jimbo Wales made Wikipedia because he wanted someone who was SO INTO CATS that they'd get alerts whenever someone changed any info about cats ! Facebook Steve did Facebook to see what movies sexy folks like !
Today I will be a patron of the ARTS . Yes . That is a classy thing to be .
You mean like a catch phrase ?
No .
Utahraptor , come quick ! My story's amazing ! !
Utahraptor , don't interrupt ! I WAS SAYING , normally it doesn't take me THIS long to finish with something good , even if it's just a little ejaculation .
Nothing beats a relaxing day of stomping humans and their tiny accessories . Especially for a T - Rex such as myself .
DO YOU EVER EXPERIENCE
O - Okay .
Eve ! The whole world doesn't need to know that stuff !
No - one ! About - about nothing !
and make it batter .
I see !
That sounds like a recipe for social disaster !
Well , I think the critical consensus is that Shakespeare illuminates our shared condition , while also writing in such beautiful prose as to be transcendental !
Oh ! You mean it's been done in alternate timelines or in the distant past , because , as God , you have access to all possibilities ever .
Rawr !
Oh , will you look at that ! NONE of my fingers have rings on them ! Gosh , that's a lot of potential
APPARENTLY , even Willy T . Shakespeare used " they " this way !
No , what you've done is convert Batman names into semi - plausible given names . Why not write a story where Batman goes undercover as " Abe Atman " ? At least that would be more honest .
Buddhism 2 is like Buddhism , but bigger , badder , and better than ever . If you liked the four noble truths , you'll LOVE that we've doubled them up , giving you eight sexy new truths to choose from ! And if you believe suffering is caused by desire , well then GET READY TO SUFFER , because we've taken Nirvana and kicked it up to the max . You won't believe your eyes !
Oh wait that was all a fantasy and this is back in reality , where I spend most of my time . Good ol' reality !
Please just sign the name change forms , PLEASE ? I'd love to call you Shortpants . " How was your day , Shortpants ? " " Stop eating all the ice cream , Shortpants ! "
Two words :
woooo
Man , who hasn't written a story about a Man With A Problem for a while ? Is it me ?
These phrase origins : they're so plausible ! !
It's not hard to imagine a future where more recorded information exists ABOUT me than information I personally produced . You may not know what I cared about , who I loved , or what I cared about , but by God you'll know my ad click behavior patterns and what my IP address was searching for .
The opposite of solipsism ( where you believe you are the only real person who is imagining a universe ) is antisolipsism , in which you believe everyone is real except you ! I may have just made this up . Anyway !
Not failure , Utahraptor ! Approximations of success !
LATER , T - REX PUBLISHES HIS NEW BOOK ! IT'S CALLED " LOLITA 2 : THE PREQUEL ! NOW LOLITA'S EVEN YOUNGER "
Never lose a baby , because if you do , people likely won't trust you with babies in the future !
It's gonna be so great
I mean NO .
Oh my god I'm dying
Sure ! Although , the emphasis you placed on " travelling companion " does fill me with some suspicion .
Therefore ours is the worst of all possible worlds ?
I'll go on a bike ride with you , T - Rex !
That's KINDA metal , I guess .
- AAAK IS NOT SOMETHING I REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO AS AN ADULT
WE DON'T LIKE TO PARTY T - REX
Yes ! I've always wanted to do that . For some reason , I've always wanted to be one of those people who does that !
I forgot to feed the dog ! I'll do it tomorrow .
A bluff !
NO
If you buy into solipsism , then what are the odds you're the chosen one ? Maybe there's some actual solipsist who really IS the only real thing going , and they're imagining everything for you , even when you're not around . What a card , huh ? What a crazy dude !
How do you get your name on a street sign ? Is there like , a place where I can slap my name down and say " So hey , I heard THAT name's really rad " ?
Maybe I was warning someone else to my left ! MAYBE RISK IS PART OF FREEDOM AND BY PROTECTING MY FRIENDS FROM ALL POSSIBLE DANGER I STUNT THEIR GROWTH AND BECOME THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO THEIR OWN SELF - REALIZATION ? ?
Boxing ! The word is a seventeenth - century alliteration of 'fisty' ( of the fists ) and 'cuff' !
- but the ship would not have sunk !
Okay , so we start with a superheated and dense force - unified space -
t - rex
The future having different opinions than the present is making it REALLY HARD for me to be popular across all possible timelines .
WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THE ENTIRE AIRPLANE OUT OF THE SAME STUFF BLACK BOXES ARE MADE OF ?
In MY version , this isn't an allegory or anything . Instead , it's an ALTERNATE HISTORY where Adam and Eve decide not to eat the apple ! The entire book of Genesis grinds to a halt at the point where Eve says " Dudes , turns out I'm NOT hungry ! "
Also , maybe try Google ? I dunno .
It'll be great ! I'll move to a new town and START OVER . Then every chance I have , I'll make the other decision : the one I didn't make the first time !
" How do I love plagiarism ? Let me count the ways . "
Says you , Mr . I Wish I Chose That Sweet Number !
ONE DAY GINGER PEANUT'S DOG SPARKY GOES MISSING BUT REALLY HER DAD JUST TOOK HIM TO THE VET
T - REX SORRY FOR INSULTING YOUR BEATS JUST A FEW SECONDS AGO
I dunno - I still think you fetishize the other , T - Rex ! What do you think , Mr . Tusks ?
Hah ! I deny all these scurrilous allegations !
Oh , I know ! That's not what I meant . I meant , " I bet that , HAD I SPENT YEARS TRAINING , I could be an amazing ballet dancer " .
Excuse me sir , are you lost ? !
That's jerky too !
Just say the word !
TODAY , MAN : NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS
The flashback can be used to provide more detail about a character's motivation ! For instance :
UTAHRAPTOR , WAS THAT A BORING QUESTION ? ?
Anyway , I volunteered at a daycare and we helped the kids write letters . If you look closely you'll see the letter is not from me but from Utahraptor and His Rad Fried Timmy .
I should fire you , but instead I'm giving you a raise and recalibrating my charts !
I see leaves of green / red onions too / I see them here , for me and you / And I think to myself : / " What A Wonderful Pre - Packaged Asian - Style Salad from Loblaw's Grocery . "
T - REX'S BUSY DAY
" We will fight them on the beaches " - Winston Churchill
I've got it , Dromiceiomimus ! I get the guy I want to hang out with to take me to the FRIEND ZONE , and we're SET .
To be honest , I HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY SUSPICIONS .
Today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things ! As a dinosaur , stomping is the best part of my day indeed !
Oooh ! And it'll be in one long take , so that I can't be accused of using editing to privilege some images over others ! It's going to be great ! Great and APOLITICAL .
" Anyway it's really too bad he couldn't talk well ! "
Ridiculous . What are you going to say ? " WE NEED TO BREAK UP ; ) " ?
How are we judging these disparate forms of art ?
A FEW YEARS LATER :
Men love a woman who remembers his birthday . Try remembering your man's birthday , and them when the big day comes , tell him you hope he has a good time , because he deserves it !
MEGA STRENGTH
Oh , not much !
What foods provide vitamin B12 ?
Excellent ! BUT I WARN YOU :
Oh my God , me too ! !
There's a lot I don't know about being a professional chef . There's a lot I don't know about a lot of things !
I think this is just a matter of figuring out a different sort of Life Points & # 8482 ; !
So what does this mean ?
Everyone has some problems , right ? We all got our own problems . Well .
Oh , hey , D . ! I was just stomping around here , you know , " stomping the old houses ! "
If the problem involves interpersonal relationships , turn to panel 3 ! If not , panel 4 !
Oh man ! So weird !
So you're aiming for the under - six market ?
" PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR DETECTIVE ADVENTURE " Sherlock shrieks !
But what if it didn't have to be that way ? If we lived forever , we could learn so much ! We could make connections between completely unrelated fields .

PIPE DOWN , UTAHRAPTOR ! YOU'RE RUINING THE COUPLE'S SPECIAL DAY . ANYWAY , YOU CAN NOW KISS THE BRIDE N' STUFF .
INCREDIBLE MOMENTS IN HISTORY
GREETINGS T - REX HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO PRODUCE YOUR OWN VIDEO GAME
Seriously though ! He was such a jerk !
Wait - are you really abandoning the ethic of reciprocity ?
I say that sarcastically , because who cares about corn ! !
DROMICEIOMIMUS'S HOUSE :
Sure do ! !
INDEED IT DOES : " Little Mister Chubby Cheeks . "
Seriously everyone ! How come ?
People have invented pronouns like " hir " , " phe " , " zhe " , and " thon " !
Maybe you should focus more on themes instead of powers , T - Rex !
This means that you have to shower and if you always wake up with food on your face then you have to understand that you have a problem . We all have problems , but yours is that you go to sleep beside bowls of wet salad and then in your sleep , you tip over the bowl . You need to work on that . I don't know what to tell you .
It doesn't matter ! My beats are great !
Some people get to live well , yeah ! THE LUCKY ONES .
THAT'S MY JOKE ! That's my joke , only it's worse because nobody learns physics and PLUS an engineer is more likely to design or build it , not discover it ! God . GOD . Worst Hallow'en FTL joke ever .
. . . Or - or you could bop yourself , if it's your turn to do the revenging .
By the way , " man naps " sounds pretty suggestive !
If you'll excuse me , Utahraptor , I need to go drop a barf , change my name to " Chili Cheese Frieson - theside " , and NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN .
T - Rex , that's terrible ! Now I feel super old and sad !
You wake up and you are inside cyberspace !
How many Os ?
What's the matter , William ? TOO CHICKEN TO WORK IT IN ? ?
It's like they're all poorly - phrased versions of things that could be condensed down . Like , " You are what you ingest , figuratively , and , in a sense , literally ! " It's just weird .
I set 'em up , future generations knock 'em down !
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW THIS HAS OCCURREEEEEEEEEE -
pathetic fallacy more like pathetic . . . fall i see ( a good burn to use against the season of autumn ) ] ]
T - REX'S FIRST NIGHTMARE
I've said it before , but I'll say it again : the absurdists were not the cheeriest potatoes in the bag .
Man ! I even checked with God and he was all " I'M BUSY WITH GOD STUFF BLAH BLAH BLAH HEY I'M TOO IMPORTANT TO COME PARTY WITH MY AWESOME DINOSAUR FRIEND " . Who am I going to party with , the Devil ?
I'LL be the judge of that !
LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Aristotle ! Stop wasting your time wondering if chickens or eggs came first !
My superspy character , Angola Maldives , was on another mission ! But it had gone poorly and he got captured by the bad guy , one Turkmenistan " Stan " Barents . " Geez Stan , why you gotta be such a DICK ? ? " Angola said .
Just watch me for the changes and try to keep up !
The rags still thirsted for living blood , but by carefully wrapping them around a specially - constructed dynamo she was able to transform this motion into useful work . Once again , Robyn had transformed supernatural phenomena into clean , renewable energy , and the hatred of the dead kept our cities lit and our houses warm .
I wake up into real life again !
Alright then !
NO , NOT AWESOME .
LOL ! ! !
God , you're omnipotent , right ? Which means you can do ANYTHING ?
So each new tattoo shoots the old one , but what happens when you run out of space ?
I know this now !
Luckily , as a warm - blooded being , this cold weather means little to me !
All these books were published decades ago !
Even sunflowers ? They tilt to follow the sun !
I had the most disturbing thought today . . .
You're not making this easy on us !
THE DAY DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE TO A PARTY TOO EARLY
No ! 1990s ! !
This one's way more sustainable . You get ghosts for free , just by dying ! !
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE TADPOLES THAT HATCH FROM THEIR HERMAPHRODITIC PARENTS AND SWIM TILL THEY FIND A ROCK WHICH THEY ATTACH TO AND NEVER MOVE AGAIN
TODO :
There's tons of women named Jennifer , right Dromiceiomimus ?
So long T - Rex ! I hope you don't become your own grandfather !
They each use their cards to guess a secret number : the closest without going over winds a prize ! But that was too confusing for them , so now the secret number's always 21 . They guess a number WHOSE VALUE IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE , and yet they still mostly lose .
You are , but it's okay , she's into it too ! She loves it , actually . I'll give you her number !
PRESENTLY :
One might expect me to become hilariously angry at such a comment , but I'm managing my anger .
Sure ! What's up ?
Or a tree where the fruit is just a smaller version of the SAME tree , so you can have INFINITE TREES ! !
And these simulated dudes wouldn't even know they're in a simulation !
I ask only for your attention , for my sister is deathly ill with the cholera !
Sheesh , T - Rex !
I'm NOT .
I remember this tiny house and car ! I liked to stomp on them regularly ! Like so !
Body farm owner ! !
Daaaaamn !
Well then , allow me . An all - you - can - eat restaurant , especially in a world where people are starving , is essentially immoral . Besides , consider the symbolism of gorging yourself on more food than you actually need : of eating just for eating's sake . Gluttony because it's affordable : what kind of
. . . NOT QUITE . Alex removes the facade from his podium .
And Google beat Apple , which means if oranges win , then we'll FINALLY find out once and for all who would win in a fight : Google or oranges !
The downside is they're always a few hours away from starving to death .
Well ! I guess you've got no need for me then ! I GUESS I'LL JUST GO HOME AND DIE ALONE !
Does anybody else find themselves getting sincerely angry at what fictional characters do ? I think about it often . Maybe too often ?
I know ! That's totally why I'm suggesting it .
Okay , but one could argue that the intelligent life we represent is something that could be ENTIRELY UNIQUE in the Universe . That's worth preserving !
I - maybe ?
I'm sure in a few months I will be bored with the snow , but right now it is exciting and magical and makes everything look pretty !
Troubled by thoughts of my own mortality !
Too . Friggin' . Fragile !
We have , T - Rex ! We have made all sorts of SCIENTIFIC discoveries .
It's SO GOOD .
Let's imagine I'm Batman ! I go out and fight crime every night . Then I go to bed and sleep all day !
Mars sucks , let's terraform VENUS
Oh man , Jake !
That's the last wee - mail ever , I'm not made of weemails over here
YEARS LATER , THE PRESENTS ARE GONE , BUT THE PLASTIC BAGS HAVE YET TO BIODEGRADE !
And all the men wore hats while the women baked pies ! Sure , we had the stability we craved after the turmoil of WWII , but at what cost ? Repression both sexual and sociological left lasting scars , leading in many ways to the cultural self - doubt of the 60s but who cares , we've got to plan this party !
Choco peanuts and gummy bears , with post dessert choco coffee beans !
It's Controversy Monday !
Jay got his wish , but Clark had spent YEARS learning to control his powers , and Jay hadn't . X - rays and heat vision began spewing out of his eyes , while his freeze breath began encasing everything around him in giant ice cubes . He covered his face and flew to the moon , where he could train in safety !
I know , right ? ? Has nobody told him ? THEY ? RE THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL FORCE . Though , to be fair , I can kinda see why nobody ? s told him .
I've never worked retail ! How bad could it be ?
Ladies ! Pleasing a man is EASY !
It's not just hard : in fact , it may well be impossible !

AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
How did I know ? You see that ? Proof !
Now , to convince my friends that I'm not coo - coo KRAZY !
Here's what ghosts do : throw plates around , rattle chains , point out where their body is buried , and appear in blurry photographs . Here's what ghosts DON'T DO : sit down with friends and catch up on all they missed , call up the media and explain about the afterlife , or run experiments to determine the limits and possibilities of their new existence .
And I myself learned the wedding actually doesn't get stopped ! Instead you get kicked out by muscle dudes . What I should've shouted was " BRIEFLY DELAY THE WEDDING ! ! " and then said " Okay cool thanks " and ran away . In fact . . .
So what , you think your old friends WON'T be able to find you online ? Did we all get super dumb at Google ?
Yayyyyyy sex !
Dunno what to tell you , dude . It's almost like English wasn't designed , but rather coalesced around folks who just wanted to do what all language speakers do : find more persuasive ways to convince others to boink 'em .
In the future , it stand for " Only Muscles ( Are ) Good " !
It happens in a bunch of stories , Dromiceiomimus , I'm really not sure how you missed them
A bunch of us want to find meaning and purpose in our lives and the Universe . Unfortunately , the Universe itself is indifferent , uncaring and meaningless !
HOURS LATER , PARADOX TOWNE IS STILL INFESTED BY BALLS . YOU STRAP A SHOTGUN TO YOUR BACK AND SET OFF ALONE DOWNTOWN . WE SEE THE SUN QUIETLY SETTING ON THE TOWNE AS YOUR FIRST SHOT GOES OFF . BIRDS SCATTER INTO THE SKY .
Name one painting that's not the Mona Lisa , The Scream , Starry Night , the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , or the one with the dour couple holding the pitchfork .
HITLER APPLICABILITY LEVELS APPROACHING 100 % ! !
The ONLY advantage I can think of is that it'll be cool on Hallowe'en . That's it ! And that's not even much of an advantage , actually ! Not even !
Alright . Today you're going to solve all the problems ; you're going to make all the good decisions . Your life is going to improve , and it's going to be GREAT . You're going to be perfect FOREVER .
Unfortunately for him , whenever a bird got shot by his rifle , the ghost of that bird came back to haunt him . Soon he was bothered by hundreds of birdghosts who all wanted revenge , which was understandable , since he shot 'em .
Looks like there are untold millions of ideas and inventions all lost because the conscious mind was preparing to shut down for a bit and couldn't be bothered to save its work . Hah hah , looks like we'll never know what we lost ! HAH HAH , LOOKS LIKE HAVING A PHYSICAL BODY IS THE WORST .
Yeah , this dude had one !
. . . Yes .
Their superior tech and inhuman biological warfare techniques nearly wiped intelligent life off the planet . Disease emptied entire cities of their inhabitants , unknown futuristic weaponry killing those that remained . A brutal regime of assimilation worked to wipe out any remaining Earth culture . But . . . SOME survived !
A better understanding of ethics ? Plus the ability to not feel bad for accidentally " murdering " your friends who shoot down your ideas .

Later I had cupcakes !
It all depends on what you mean by " best " !
Now we're sinking because of how shabby this boat is !
Leave me alone !
But the awesome news is that there's ALSO parts that are unclaimed by anyone !
I'm funny ! I'm cool ! I clean up nice and can carry a conversation !
SORRY I MISSED YOUR BIRTHDAY T - REX BUT I HOPE THE UNIVERSE SUDDENLY BEING A RAP MUSICAL MAKES UP FOR IT
I know ! This has some VERY incredibly exciting implications regarding the plausible canonicity of your fan fictions !
And also horses !
So your ad campaign would be " Forget stereotypes : comics are rad ! " ?
I think he does it a TINY bit , Utahraptor !
But what happens if the happy machine fails ? If it breaks into pieces ?
It gives me time to think about the movie I just saw .
I know for a fact that on e of those doesn't exist , T - Rex !
Okay , good !
Embarrassed , they returned to Earth , but pretty soon nobody cared because the knowledge we were caged within a solid dome of unknown providence brought the entire planet togethet - - TO STAGE THE GREATEST JAILBREAK OF ALL TIME . THE END !

BACK STORY : T - REX'S HOUSE IS MESSY ?
THE VIDEO GAME EXPERT
LATER : T - REX IS KNOWN ONLY AS " HUGGS BOSON "
Dude , that's not funny !
Science tells us that English has OVER 350 different words , but sometimes een those aren't enough !
And clearly , THAT SOLVES ALL THE PROBLEMS . The kid grows up to be super handsome , and to punish Tantalus for his - hosting ? - they put him in a pool of water just beneath the branches of a fruit tree . But when he tries to drink , the water moves away , and when he tries to eat , the branches move away !
With this in mind , I have created . . . the Nutrinomicon !
You actually do a form of photosynthesis yourself , T - Rex !
If youth is so great , how come you're wasting it , T - Rex ?

Game over !
IT'S ADORABLE . " I'm not sleepy / but I'll sleep with you . " ? And there's a little picture of a teddybear in a nightcap ? Oh snap ! WE JUST MAXED OUT CUTE .
Why aren't I more popular already , Domiceiomimus ? I'd pal around with me . I'd date me !
Oooh , boo on the last line of your song , my friend !
And even we just sit around doing nothing , I can still that we're KICKING IT .
The secret is whispering !
What do you do in " Monkey Whore ! " ?

It's short but it costs $ 200 a copy because I am bad at , like -
See , Dromiceiomimus , I was going to say " best goddess ever , " but the fact that there's a goddess Frigg has immeasurably improved MY ENTIRE LIFE . Frigg ! She can SEE THE FUTURE but doesn't tell anyone what she sees , so hen someone stubs their toe they can say , " Aw , FRIGG ! " and that is DEFINITELY probably where the expression comes from .
IT'S NOT ADORABLE .
I'm surprised ! You don't have any idea ?
If you ever find your consciousness ( your self ) sent back in time to a much younger you , there are some changes to be expected ! Remember :
YOU GUYS SURE DO LIKE TO RIDE MOTORCYCLES
He has encyclopaedic knowledge about every RPG , MMORPG , FPS , RTS , TBS and IF game every made !
( IN THIS PANEL , DROMICEIOMIMUS SAYS YES )
Clearly way WAY too hard !
Something difficult yet possible , Dromiceiomimus ! My stars ! This is like a 1920s comedy routine without the punchline .
Friends are good things to have ! They can help you out when you are sad ( a psychological benefit ) , and can lend you money if you need it ( an economic benefit ) !
I will be remembered in the CULTURAL ZEITGEIST . And this time I won & # 8217 ; t even have to do anything memorable ! I will simply become famous by virtue of being famous . I will construct a synthetic celebrity and I will reap the benefits !
A CAUTIONARY TALE
I wonder if it's ever been used
Wacky staff hijinks befuddle uptight manager of Life Magazine , circa 1950 !
AND YOU COULD'VE JUST SAID " FOOD AND THINGS THAT MAKE ME SLEEPY "
I'm not sure I'd want to be with someone who describes their own body as " surprising " .
Is it Batman ?
Also : there's also no such thing as a random event !
Wait a second : Utahraptor totally set me up for giving a sweet answer with that question ! !
I spend hours each day just staring into her face and being endlessly entertained , and I can't imagine life without her
I don't know ! WHAT THE HELL ARE OUR CLOCKS MEASURING ? ? aaaarrrRRRRGHHH
AW MAN ! ! I totally knew that one !
Why are you worried about this , T - Rex ? It's just a genre label !
One time a hot person had a sexual encounter of the type you enjoy , and it was sexy ! It was super rad and sexy !

Our planet's finest athletes are gathering to compete for greatness , in a worldwide celebration of peak physical fitness known only as McDonald's Presents The Olympic Games !
Which means it could be possible for light to CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE FRIGGIN' UNIVERSE . And if that's possible then some distant galaxies we're observing could really be DUPLICATE IMAGES of other galaxies , formed by incredibly ancient light that's already lapped the Universe once !
In any case , one day a killer asteroid is discovered headed straight for Earth !
It occurs to me , Dromiceiomimus , that my skeleton probably looks pretty awesome , and just such a skeleton would look rad hanging up in my living room . Folks would say " Oh man , that skeleton is awesome ! " and I'd say " Yes . Like the rhetorical magic , this too was within you all along . " Assuming they were the same species as the skeleton , I mean .
It is as if we are from two different planets !
Have se - - OH MY GOSH
You really think people want to ride around on a platforming horse as Richard the Third ?
Hanging out with friends , trying to make things rad and myself EVEN MORE AWESOME whenever possible , and , OCCASIONALLY , smooching people who are so ATTRACTIVE I kinda can't even believe it . I want to be able to look back on my life and say . . .
I don't see what the big deal is . We're having a nice chat .
Isn't that weird ? I haven't thought about that day for years .
Spring !
The reason this word is so great is that it means " given to the overuse of long words " and it itself is a long word !
It does seem to be a curious oversight .
NEW BIKE DAY
Hee hee ! Comedy gold !
Finally ! I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ASKED .
I guess the odds of my writing a story and having it be what ACTUALLY HAPPENED to some dude are pretty low , huh .
Please , Utahraptor , I -
INTOXICATING
I stranded him on a planet years ago , and he never forgets a face !
But dude , I'm TOTALLY PREPARED if I get one and she wants us to have casual group sex with multiple partners .
What else would you suggest ?

This is a disaster ! Dromiceiomimus , you have to help me !

On the other hand , the person that left this comic here is kind of a sucky person too !
IT IS INTERESTING TO PONDER WHY THEIR POPULARITY HAS FALTERED WHILE THAT OF THEIR SISTER GENRE OF RPGS HAS REMAINED REMARKABLY RESOLUTE
The ship could also have been saved with a bomb threat , delaying its maiden voyage !
What style do you have that can be " cramped " , T - Rex ?
Dromiceiomimus , do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is ?
PRECISELY !
Almost , but there are still effective limits , therefore : finite number of songs !
I imagine it'd raise some issues of identity and self . . .
And the pace of innovation is only accelerating . Consider that iPods from only five years ago are now LUDICROUSLY UNACCEPTABLE , when in history a person might own a single record player their entire lives ! It is certain that in the year 65 , 000 , 000 marvels dwarfing even branded consumer electronics await us . What new and fundamental discoveries about the universe are ahead ? Will our personal holographic media players ALSO accept phone calls ? ?
I guess .
If you say " far - fetched " then I'm leaving
I can see this getting old fast , T - Rex !
Attention , self ! I don't know why you still feel bad about not preventing the Titanic disaster ; you are basically as blameless as it is possible for a dude to be .
oh no , the vom is coming out
There are many situations in which " that's what she said ! " may be appropriately used ! For example , after someone says , uh ,
Listen , never write when you're horny
maybe it's this way instead
Linguistically speaking , I mean
Ladies ! Are you a mammal ? I read this thing that says a bunch of mammals wear bras that don't fit properly . Maybe look into that , huh ?
Okay ! I'm going to stop talking now !
If the basement keeps on flooding , then I'll certainly be blue !
Okay , time travellers ! This is your LAST CHANCE to tell me I'm the more right guy here . Right now . Now ! Nownownow . Now ! Nnnnnnow ! Now . . . . Aw maaaan .
Oh man ! !
OCD stands for " Obsessive Compulsive Disorder " ! It means you are consumed by the constant need to do something , in this case , stomp .
I GUESS I AM . Let me just check with an actual doctor real quick though .
LATER : FAST - MOVING PULMONARY ANTHRAX ZOMBIES
Why don't you just ignore all that and use it anyway ?
There must be a way to capitalize on this ! !
Everyone's trying to grapple with these sprees , wondering if maybe folks ARE inherently awful , wondering if maybe one bad day is all that stands between them and the murderers they see on TV . You know this because you watch the same reports while in traction !
Your - your hands look weird
I think what Dromiceiomimus is saying is that there are forms !
It's a great assumption . Not only does it turn me into the most influential person in history , but it ensures that at some point before I die , I'll go back in time and set things up so things are exactly as I remember them now . If that means being an unknown figure throughout history thousands of times , so be it ! It sounds rad to me !
Hey , man ! What's the haps ?
GAMERS : are you the best at games ?
Is it because those blurred faces remind you that no matter what , the past can never be completely known ?
Cool
I honestly did not expect the list to be this depressing !
I've been paying ACTUAL DOLLARS for canned pasta sauces for years !
Whew ! !
Plus , PLUS , I'll be able to pee around my house to let everyone know I live there !
TOMORROW
She doesn't say " Mirror mirror on the wall , how can life's curse of aging be stalled ? "
Look , we should just admit it : we're in over out heads here . If someone ever asks us " how do cities " again we'll just reply with " Quite well thanks " and drop the mic and leave .
I got mine from boxes of pasta !
" Frigorific " is actually old news , T - Rex ! It was Merriam - Webster's Word of the Day last - Thursday , I think ?
RARGH ! I am getting the most out of destroying this tiny log cabin !
TEN THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF YOUR HEAD
Have I learned nothing ? ! ? !
We'll also all have computers crammed in our brains !
He's right there ; just talk to him !
Maybe even without mass , photons can still exert pressure !
What ? It could be !
But check it : multiply the Earth's magnetic field by a quarter of a million times , and you've got magnetic force to mess with the electrons in a frog's atoms enough that it LEVITATES . The average frog weighs 1 / 4000th of a human , so therefore with a billion times the earth's magnetic field EVERY HUMAN
Aw come on !
I'd have a body that would CHANGE SHAPE in response to the light of a full moon . That's insane ! If we could harness the powers of my sweet - ass hairy body , the advances would be incredible ! We could lose fat and build muscle instantly ! We could restore broken limbs ! WE COULD HELP BALD MEN NOT BE BALD ANYMORE , IF THAT IS WHAT THEY WANTED . Plastic surgeons would be out of a job !
I . . . kinda do too ? ?
Dang ol' BABIES .
PANACEA ? ! THAT'S THE SECRET WORD OF THE DAY !
{ { thought bubble } } WHO THE HECK SAID THAT ? !
Thanks ! Don't you think it tastes like . . . philosophical compromise ?
Hey . That was a lot of acronyms there .
FORK FACTS
Are you in this house , God ? I am looking for you ! Come out come out whereever you are ! Ready or not , here I come !
But maybe INVISIBLE giants exist ? Again , the answer is no : such giants would leave impressions in the ground visible in satellite imagery . It's kinda why we invented satellites in the first place ?
Maybe I'll just like the taste of BURYING YOUR ASS !
That surprised and outraged punctuation suggests so much : a ship out of control or perhaps a teen comedy where a colossal boat barges up on the governess as she takes her morning tea ? SO MANY HIJINKS could happen in " Titanic ? ! " !
But not all women are alike ! I bet you some women like a man who is a push - over .
I have too much rage ! All these people are writing dumb things with incorrect spelling and grammar , and when you correct them , they just get angrier ! Its really annoying !
Seriously , who does that ?
I ! !
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I KEEP MAKING IT SO YOU NEVER GET A PRINTING PRESS
Yeah , probably .
" Would you also break up with a rocket skateboard ? BECAUSE THOSE WOULD BE GREAT . LIKE ME . I AM GREAT . "
" You don't need kids of your own to be a strange adult who is trying to get them to eat something . "
That's it ? No great insight , no perspective beyond " I like it when it's windy " ?
You make skydiving more interesting !
" Excuse me T - Rex , but which toothbrush do you think is yours ? "
HELLO ? ?
I'm here to pick up my prescription " Happy New year 2004 " glasses ! They have a plastic " 2 " on one side and a " 4 " on the other .
But hamburgers predate McDonald's !
DUDE THAT'S LIKE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW RELIGION WORKS
Doesn't he know he's damaging his LUNGS ? !
My name is " Skellington " and you are being racist for saying that all dromiceiomimoids look the same !
A medical doctor is a pretty prestigious job to have ! The catch is , it takes years of work to become a doctor . Like , literal YEARS .
My sole regret is that my own biography will be reduced to mere Antonio fan fiction !
[ [ thinking ] ] Aw frig , my friends are better at writing my own stories than I am ! Hah hah hah I am a fraud and a failure hah hah hah whyyyyyy
BOO HOO .
THEY ARE 18 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR FOR YOUR INFORMATION
YOU'RE ONLY PROVING MY POINT
I REQUEST A SAMPLE
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
Our letter to Professor Science comes from me ! I write :
That , but also a lot of English words they needed didn't exist yet ! So John invented them , and we still use his " behemoth " , " puberty " , and " zeal " . But he also needed a word for intestines " , and the phrase he came up with - FOR THE BIBLE , I REMIND YOU - was " arse ropes " .
What ? No ! I don't have cooties ! Nobody has cooties !
You are incorrect ! The phrase comes from olde - fashioned steam - powered trains !
I GUESS
TODAY ? ? ?
" Nice " is a proper subset of " awesome " , " sweet " and " rad " , therefore she has at least a couple nice dresses . Oh snap !
HEY T - REX I BET YOU COULDN'T EAT 12 SALTINE CRACKERS IN UNDER A MINUTE
You Finally came up with your personal creation myth , huh ?
How big is the room ?
But wimpy guys talk about women too !
Hells yesses !
EARLIER :
I believe it' called . . . " DRIVING " ? ?
WHY DO YOU PEOPLE KEEP BUYING T - REX'S RELATIONSHIP BOOKS
AND IT'D BE EASIER FOR ME T - REX IF I COULD CONVERSE WITH SHIGERU MIYAMOTO
. . . Isn't there a danger our nation's hotties would also fall for them , thereby ruining out plan ?
There's been tons of folk in every generation who wanted to be immortal , and I don't see any of them still kicking around .
Oops ! !
PETEY DO YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER WITH HER ON PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES ? ?
Before I could fix his greatest work ? How tragic ! !
And at some point they've rescued this guy who's been bitten , but who's hidden it . He dies , and the next time Batman and Robin come back to the Cave , they find that everyone inside is now a zombie ! Their effort has been entirely futile , and everyone they've rescued is dead .
Ah !
Primitivism has this strange semi - positive racism attached to it too .
We say " Let's Party ! ! " all the time , but when we say " Let us Party ! ! " it sounds hella formal !
I've already come up with the perfect one !
I don't owe you ten sub sandwiches ! Why the heck would I ever owe you ten sub sandwiches ?
See what I did there , Dromiceiomimus ? I used " liquid " as an intensifier .
" Ignore that last bit ! I meant to write that we know T - Rex was awesome and I wish I were like him . "
Why do we let language get like this ?
William Shakespeare was an excellent writer guy , so we saves his plays so that everyone can enjoy them ! Generations have applauded them as being pretty okay ! !
You gave me the idea !
No , because they're & # 8212 ; massless ?
I guess we really did each have our own . . . Great Expectations .
Wow , that's crazy ! I'll come back when you're less INSANE , because the second law is still really important !
Whatever !
There's some unclaimed land in the Antarctic , and there's a couple thousand square kilometers between Egypt and Sudan that nobody wants .
Utahraptor , PLEASE : whatever's going on here , we're clearly at the level where it's gonna make the news if it goes well OR catastrophically wrong .
Everyone ( including me ) is an end in himself : not a means to an end for others !
YOU'RE THE STAR OF THE STORY ! CHOOSE FROM 2 POSSIBLE ENDINGS !
T - Rex , that is the least - appealing offer I have ever contemplated .
Have you ever imagined what it would be like if you WERE a movie star , T - Rex ?
TODAY IS THE DAY I SHARE MORE ABOUT MYSELF THAN MAYBE I WANTED TO
Sure do what ?
WHAT IS SO INTERESTING OVER THERE
It should mean " a good time that is large or immense : METAPHORICALLY like a whale " , but the metaphor's broken because it's always used on literal friggin' whales . " Dog - gone great " is getting there too . But Im gonna fight it , one person at a time !
Exactly ! Anything they wouldn't need for the trip back was left on the moon . Cameras ! Scoops ! SPACE BOOTS . And . . .
UM T - REX IT'S ME SHAKESPEARE AND MAY I JUST SAY YOUR RHYME IS WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING I EVER DID WRITE
So what do they do ?
T - REX IN HEAVEN THE BULLET HOLE WATER THING HAPPENS TO ANYONE WHO DIED FROM BEING MACHINE GUNNED IN THE CHEST
But fat beats are very hard to find when they're fresh , so I recommend you simply marry a beatboxer . They make the beats come out of their mouths !
It's just - - usually when you reference something in a work of literature , you do it for a reason .
" As a farter , I feel I am entitled to two 15 - minute fart breaks each day where I go outside and just fart and fart and fart "
THANKSGIVING DAY COMICS
Eat a whole bag of plums ?
Okay nevermind .
What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline ? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam ! That sounds like it might be . . . AWESOME ?
So It'd be told in a series of shorts : each short starts a little before everybody flies into a wall , and ends with everybody flying into a wall .
But you said you were confirming an initial suspicion .
Is it a joke or a real question ?
Nope , it's terrible . Why not forget about t - butyl mercaptan and instead get your hands on some cadaverine and putrescine , which are the organic compounds responsible for how a corpse smells ? It's a much more hilarious joke !
Petey do you want to smooch on her face ? Petey do you want to kiss her on her body ? ?
. . . Nope , it's gone . I used to know cool things to do with cool people , but then I learned about corn . I'm sorry Utahraptor : I'm useless to you now .
Oh yeah , that too ! ! Hah hah hah !
Oh wow !
I'll write plays that HINT at how great I am , how smart and sexy and awesome everyone finds me . Then I just excise every other mention of myself from history , and the plays are the only source left ! They're the only way to learn about the towering mind behind them , this Adonis of authors , this . . . T - Rex .
- - while someone else might be the best at having really important feelings and then talking about them ; I know . Let's say I measure success as an appropriately weighted average of all possible forms . The issue remains !
Hey , incidentally , I'M working on a comic where there's a man on his hands and knees looking under his couch and his wife is saying " Have you found your keys ? " and he's saying " No , I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For ( My Keys ) " .
Alright everyone , wizards use magic words to cast spells , right ? This is like the main thing that wizards do . Here's a hot tip :
And that spider itself had been bit by an adult man !
- such as by sending aid to countries where many cannot afford food or even basic sanitation .
Like we needed sex to be EVEN WEIRDER .
THE DUDE WHO INVENTED EVERYTHING
( That was an echo ! )
So this homeless guy asked me for change yesterday .
But suppose . . . BUSES TO THE AIRPORT HAVE ENDED FOR THE DAY ? ?
SHORTLY THEREAFTER .
Man ! Friggin' English friggin' lets me down friggin' again ! !
Hey , God ! Please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; the courage to change the things I can ; and the wisdom to know why people would buy other comics when mine has the Riddler in drag in it ? ?
We should date !
Perhaps it's only through excavation that archaeologists learn how to better their trade .
But look : I'm crushing a house ! It is very frightening !
A rockoon is when you just friggin' tie a rocket to a balloon ! The balloon goes up some of the way , and then you FIRE THE ROCKET and it goes up the rest of the way ! IT IS THE RADDEST WAY TO ARRIVE AT WORK .
Because if not then I doubt it would be a very good salad !
Looking to lose weight ? Look no more ! You've found the ultimate guide to weight loss , with . . .
I got up early , I ate breakfast early , I showered early , and yet : I am late ! Again ! Still !
You offend your ex - girlfriends by betraying their trust , and look like a pretty big jerk in the process ?
Hah hah ! Looks like YOU undid the heat death of the universe , and everyone lived happily ever after !
Indeed !
If you continue to be so negative , man , I can just find someone else to talk to ! Billions of other potential friends , remember ?
Well , actually , some plants have male and female individuals , while others might produce flowers that are just male or just female , while still others produce flowers that have both male AND female parts .
Spring break !
And at the end , all the characters high five each other and go home to their own times , promising to write their own versions of what happened . Then , they all write their most famous works !
About 4am ! I woke up to it , which was surreal . It ended when I guess someone dissed him from across the street or behind some bushes or something ? Heyelled " Who said that ? ! " and ran off down the street .
Um . " Eventually " ?
THE FIRST THING PEOPLE USUALLY NOTICE ABOUT ME : cool toes
Get this : he's never played Duck Hunt !
MAYBE HE'LL SAY ANYTHING TO COVER IT UP
Okay , right . Like . . . this ?
Okay , some issues off just the top of my head : you haven't proven your assumption of control ( conscious or otherwise ) over personality , you seem to assume that babies are born as a blank slate with no initial personality , you leave the idea of " personality " pretty ill defined for something so central to your argument , and you haven't shown that altering behaviour ( viz . , Resolutions ) is the same as altering personality .
T - REX AS YOU SPENT LAST NIGHT RUBBING EVERY LAMP IN YOUR HOUSE I FEEL COMPELLED TO GRANT YOU THREE WISHES
Perhaps now it's time for you to MAN UP and change our cultural perception of gender then ? ?
Oh , eigenvouch that I do !
Hey , care to make it interesting ?
Ones that are more useful against rickets than crime , yes .
" Also , I wish when the badly damaged Enterprise was falling to EARTH HERSELF they explained why nobody planetside tried to beam survivors off , because HELLO , surely Earth has such resources . "
" Dr . Horseload " ?
Waaay ahead of you
it always ends in the sixth panel !
I maintain that you do ! You're pre - pubescent , then pubescent , and then post - pubescent when the changes stop !
Insects and animals , looks like you just got burned !
Not for us , Utahraptor ! Not for us .
HEY T - REX SETTLE A BET
CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
No it's not ! You're just jealous !
I wasn't like that !
I WILL T - REX
Hah ! LOOKS LIKE IT , bucko !
It saves time ! What's the difference between a dead skunk and a dead PROFESSION MEMBER in the middle of the road ?
Tell me more about DISAGREE ?
ALSO SCREW THE MALL IN ITS STUPID FACE OKAY
You are a T - Rex , undisputed King of the Dinosaurs . You are out stomping when you see a log cabin ! Turn to panel 2 .
That was indeed a difficult breakup . I'd prefer to be the person ending it , given the choice !
Greek fire was a flammable liquid that burnt on water and that could only be extinguished by burying it in sand ! The Byzantines used it to gain an advantage in all sorts of wars , and they kept it such a secret that eventually they forgot how to make it too . Awesome ! Damascus steel was SO STRONG that people claimed its swords cut through other swords - but the technique used to make it is lost , and the raw materials used are long gone . OH WELL ! !
Okay . But you have to keep it secret !
" Okay ! "
Answer : TOTALLY EXCELLENT ? ?
I'd sincerely like that to see THAT , please ! !
O - Orange ? Deep saffron ? GAMBOGE ?
I could work on my own projects AND cook delicious meals AND I could make bad decisions all day long .
Maybe they only favourite unremarkable things !
We can't move away , because WE'LL feel bad that you stayed because of us and now , we're leaving !
I DO I DO I DO
ENEMY'S NAME
You're doing this ?
You can never have too much pie !
Originally , our greatest minds suggested that that just as we can see through ghosts , they too can see through us , in a figurative sense !
Apology accepted .
Already , a pretty sweet boat !
Alright , I . . . um .
So yeah , as I was saying , the relativist fallacy is when you reject a claim by saying " Oh , that may be true for you , but it's not true for me . "
FACT : we know how to build sweet - looking cars . FACT : only a few cars are made sweet - looking , even though we could just slap a rad body on top of a boring ol' chassis and call it a day . FACT : I am correct .
I don't get why you're trying to say that though . Have you been called misogynist lately ?
Or maybe they feed on our life force energies ! !
Your welfare - take heed ! Rise , and walk with me .
I thought we had a thing going !
Ladies , do you want to get with a guy who JUST THIS AFTERNOON vomited up a partially - digested tiny corpse ? ? BECAUSE IF NOT :
[ [ with redoubled emphasis ] ] EVERYTHING
How is this even possible ? !
Frig ! I freaked myself out too ! !
THIS IS THE VEHICLE WE , AS A PEOPLE , CHOOSE FOR OUR STORIES
Hah hah , no thanks !
I bet I still have all sorts of secret skills I just haven't discovered yet . Like - like throwing my voice !
Beg pardon ?
Angola Maldives , my cool spy character , was once again dangling over a shark tank ! But it wasn't just sharks down there , he realized : there was also the infrastructure required to keep sharks alive in captivity !
Your character is a ( n ) . . .
Time for some more epitaphs , everyone ! !
We should be inventing NEW flavours ! I can get " salt and vinegar " here in reality , which I REMIND YOU is already lousy with both salt AND vinegar . I CAN MAKE THAT FLAVOUR MYSELF . Give me BLACK HOLE flavoured chips !
God wants a noun !
What's with everyone asking me if I have cooties ? Maybe YOU have cooties !
I demand instant gratification !
this smile is because I'm always happy to see you , not for your conversational betrayal !
The dentist office over here is out of business , T - Rex ! The dentist said his only regret in life was that he could never persuade you to floss regularly , as since that embarassing failing became public he has been branded a professional failure , lost his Dentist Degree , and made a pariah in Dentist Sociey
I am a guy who is not that great a dancer . Ummm . . .
SPRING BREAAAA -
Me ! Early !
. . . Polonius is the best character ?
Dying DOES suck !
But it's a feedback loop : your own body is training you on what it needs through the medium of taste ! Eventually you'd know your own nutritional needs by PURE INTUITION .
When they arrive , be sure to pay the driver more than your contract dictates . This helps the driver .
today's recipe :
Okay . That's the most bad - ass thing I've ever heard of anyone doing with vegetables in LITERALLY FOREVER . But how'd the VEGETARIANS invent meat - flavoured veggies before we did ? That should've been our get !
When a chef gets his recipes stolen by the mob , he revenges himself on them . . . through karate . This summer , you can't make an omelet . . .
It's urban exploration ! We poke around in abandoned factories and schools and mental institutions and stuff , but not to steal things , just to look at how things have changed since the building was in use . It's awesome ! You see old bathtubs and all sorts of stuff !
I mean , YES it is , but what if the one guy KNEW what everyone should be doing ? What if he was actually the best person to be in charge of the country ?
B - B - But . . . 29 cent prints !
My mug fell because I loosened my grasp on it , allowing the myosin molecules that had bonded with actin molecules in my hands to dissolve their crossbridge bond , causing the mug to slip ! There's always a clear causality chain that we can use to determine the origin of things happening . Phew !
You know I don't ! You know I'm gonna be so sarcastic to the next statue I see .
I'm still looking though !
Is a 98 % reduction in mass tiny enough for you ? Utahraptor . THEY ARE THE MAYORS OF TINY TOWNE .
DINO BABIES GOES STRAIGHT TO # 1 !
Dear poets , I am sorry I've been making fun of your craft for over 20 years . It is actually harder than it looks !
Not by a long shot !
It's never too late to have your characters punch a dude , writers .
Did I just hear you say
So you agree , T - Rex , that omniscient means knowing EVERYTHING .
YOU AND YOUR FRIGGIN EYEBROWS
Do you mean to imply that I've plagiarized it , good sir ?
Don't leave me HANGING
So , I'm not really comfortable with the fact that my mind is actually something physical .
And THAT means you start having to choose favourites !
T - REX WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE EVEN IN THIS SITUATION
I am sick , but not in a good way . In a sore throat way . I am well and truly under the weather !
Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs !
I have been secretly programming in my spare time ! What's more , I have completed my first game . I call it . . .
ps : this entire tine kick - ass explosions were going off in the background , AW YEAH BABY
What ? No it's not . Too crazy is like , " fhqwhgads " .
I guess we never really did learn how . . . To Kill A Mockingbird .
And then she succeeds and lives forever and she's so great and smart and pretty and she marries me ! ! SURPRISE . THIS IS ACTUALLY FAN FICTION ABOUT MYSELF AND YOU LISTENED TO EVERY WORD THIS TIME .
T - REX ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO SAY HERE THAT HE WAS THIRSTY , SO HE HAS USED THE PHRASE IMPROPERLY . THIS CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS !
Man , someone's TOTALLY died posting to Twitter . I GUARANTEE IT .
N . . . No ?
No !
Everything is ready for Mayor Tusks !
5 YEARS AGO :
AND I'LL BE HONEST :
Yep , it's certain ! I can find NO DOWNSIDES with being immortal .
COMPROMISE
Is that ME playing poker with dogs ? Yes ! Is that me riding the backseat of a rearing horse with Napoleon ? IT MOST DEFINITELY IS SUPPOSED TO BE .
I think that you're being too strict about this , T - Rex !
I'm different from everyone else . I get that Bruce Willis might not be that useful if terrorists take over an office tower Christmas party !
I BELIEVE IT TO BE A CONSTRAINED GAMING EXPERIENCE BUT IN A SENSE A MORE CINEMATIC ONE THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD BE
I don't want to hear it ! No cussing !
Screw you guys , I'M going back to the shower ! !
I'm just sayin' .
Dude , you say " firefighter " instead of " fireman " or " firewoman " . You're on the side of the angels .
Challenging ARTISTICALLY .
Attention world ! I ate a sandwich , please RT ! # sandwichtime
. . . Tell them my story , Utahraptor
Pretty sure that's ultimate badass !
It was always to end with Trebek .
PROTONOSTALGIA
Oh , the usual . " Nice thing you have there ! It'd be a shame if anything . . . HAPPENED to it . "
It's the one where you're shot with a machine gun , and then later you're thirsty , and then you drink water , and then the water springs out of the holes in your body .
I'll show myself out , sorry again
I'll never say ! !
Nenu maamsamu chepalu thinanu !
I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED
HEY THE BIBLE IS OUT OF COPYRIGHT BY LIKE A THOUSAND OF YOUR EARTH YEARS
But isn't this just reinforcing your own opinions ?
How about " yo ? As in , " Yo doesn't know what yo thinks about this . " Or " bitches " , as in " Bitches didn't derive that function properly " . Men can be bitches !
Look for me , I'll be the guy shielding my head with one hand while shouting " Don't worry everyone ! I deserve this ! ! "
Why I want to go into space , an essay by me , Utahraptor !
Utahraptor orders one for her too , only his drink is slightly fancier than mine . And we go back and forth , upping the ante , sending over fancier and fancier drinks , until we're sending over full bottles of champagne !
Okay , so let's say you're a dude or lady who often is called upon to perform CPR on someone in cardiac arrest . Nice . YOU'RE A HANDY PERSON TO HAVE AROUND . When performing CPR , you're aiming for 100 chest compressions per minute , but this is an awkward rate to hit . HOWEVER , if you hum Queen's " Another One Bites The Dust " , you'll be fine ! The song is simple , catchy , memorable , AND has a steady beat that runs , as it turns out , at exactly 100 beats a minute .
NEGATIVE INCOME TAX COMICS
I must heroically continue to save us all !
THE CRY WOLF KEY
See my point ?
But let me guess : there's one big company you really like ?
It's their job to not be wrong , Dromiceiomimus !
But regrets make us who we are !
Is there any motivation that can't be reduced to self - interest ? Absolutely ! For example , I might give to charity : charity is the opposite of greed !
I didn't forget how to talk ! I just forgot how to shoot down your idea politely !
I don't know why I said I played it ; everyone just ignore me
I wish you wouldn't sexualize literary techniques , T - Rex .
In fact I'm so angry that right now I don't even want to talk about my feelings . I KNOW IT SEEMS INCONCEIVABLE , but right now , at this moment , all I want to do is be alone . And angry . Mad will do too .
No , but I was going to -
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN BUY THEM IN BULK .
It's simply directing my self - development towards an end result I imagine my target would be happy with , as if to say , " how about now ? "
Okay , that one was dumb .
God ! Can you make me Chinese so that my fist nickname makes sense ?
And you noticed it , obviously , but then you turned to me , made eye contact , and nodded with an almost undetectable Mona Lisa smile , just once . It was this amazing nod that said , " Don't worry , T - Rex . Things will be alright . Everything's gonna work out fine . "
It's not just the top of their faces , T - Rex . They have it on the edge of their EYELIDS . Some CULTIVATE it around their MOUTHS . Their mouths !
Pantheism is the belief that everything , the entire universe , is literally God !
HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES
Although I somehow feel as though we'll warp away just as Genesis goes off , and that Spock will die at the end ( needs of the many ) !
Ack !
i have to go away for a while , t - rex . thank you for making me real , if only for a little while . always remember me .
Awww ! Really ? You'd give up being a reanimated corpse for our friendship ?
MEAT PARTY ! !
utahraptor and dromiceiomimus help out t - rex in explaining his idea and get NOTHING FOR IT , what a rip ] ]
What will science be like in the year 65 , 000 , 000 ? Friends ! I am here to tell you : many amazing advances will be made !
But then they'd be less of a deal !
Of course ! Childhood is replaced with training for your time trip , and only those that pass get to go ! The failed candidates get their original timeline restored , no harm no foul . And if you DO mess up in the past , overseers roll back your entire trip !
Still ! Burnsauce ! !
But how are you going to get people to respect this idea ? Plus , IS IT NOT TRUE THAT MANY WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE TRULY HUMOURLESS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA ? ?
No , but - - see , I learned it from you !
ARE YOU A DUDE WHO IS BAD AT IDIOM
" INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY "
Gentlemen , gentlemen ! ! Please ! ] ]
The greatest proof that time travel isn't possible is that no future selves have yelled at me to stop messing the heck up
Did you get me a souvenier ? ? { { [ sic ] } }
UTAHRAPTOR : TECHNICALLY CORRECT , BUT BEING A DICK ABOUT IT
Dude
Yep ! You know what ? I'm not even fully sure what taxes ARE .
of governmental systems ? ? It's great ! You can set it up so you get a figurehead monarch who is fun to print on your money , but the REAL power is still with the people !
YOUR CIRCULATORY SYSTEM MIGHT NOT SUFFER CATASTROPHIC FAILURE , LEAVING EVERY ONE OF THE CELLS INSIDE YOUR BODY TO SILENTLY DIE !
HI ! HERE'S SOME THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG TODAY !
I've become their silent friend Ren ? , watching this baby grow up over the years . I'll see her first steps ! Her first birthday ! And in 18 or so years , I'll have tears in my eyes as my computer pings and her high school grad pictures download into my inbox . . .
LATER : T - REX'S EXTRAVAGENT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS LEAD TO A LARGE ELECTRICITY BILL
THAT MAKES ME THE ONE DUDE WHOSE NAME DOES'T MAKE HIM SOUND LIKE A FRIGGIN HOBBIT
The interest dates back to my childhood !
That's sweet !
I thought there were issues with the " grey goo " scenario being impossible ?
" Cloacapella " ?
I'd much rather they say , " What did T - Rex say he wanted to be ? I can't recall ! I bet it's what he is now , though . "
I DON'T KNOW AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU
Oh yeah ? Well HERE in the REAL WORLD , the rest of us don't have to raise the giant toenail of our second toe up while running to avoid damaging it !
I'm continuing to stomp things until someone yells , " look out ! A MONSTER ! "
We live in a world where it's possible for a thing to be SO MUCH that thing that it can flip over and become the opposite thing . Has anyone explored this property ? ? Perhaps as a power source ?
I had no idea dentists were so intense ! !
If you say something like " And then she said to me , hi [ YOUR NAME HERE ] ! " I would really appreciate it . And hey , keep this card to reuse when you're in the same position ! WE ALL DO IT .
. . . . Yes .
. . . OR IS IT ! ?
Isn't beta software MORE advanced , stable , and feature - rich than alpha software ?
THEN HE WANT TO MAKE SOME OF THE SEX WITH YOU . THAT'LL BE NICE .
Hey T - Rex , what's your favourite percussion - based theatrical experience ?
No , you're mad at J . M . " Peter Pan " Barrie for the young one , and at some anonymous wag for the genius one - nobody's found a reliable link to Oscar for it . He just gets the credit !
CAPITALISM
That's the worst failure at saying the word " cheese " that I've ever personally witnessed .
WHAT ? NO . YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO BATMAN .
I wish for -
I guess this is how rumours get started , huh ?
I suppose !
LATER , THE OCEANS BOIL AS THE EARTH TURNS TO FIRE :
POSTSCRIPT : THE NEXT DAY
Oh well ! All's well that ends well , I suppose .
what do you call a teacher who never passes gas in public ?
Dromiceiomimus ! Are you ready for your trip to the storied landmass of Australasia ?
As you walk up to the cabin , you notice there are other dinosaurs here . Nearby there is a small Dromiceiomimus , watching . Off in the distance you see what looks like a large Utahraptor . Utahraptors were the natural enemies of your species . A meeting might lead to conflict . Do you want to try your luck in an encounter with the Utahraptor ? Turn to panel 4 . If you think it's better to play it safe , turn to panel 3 .
IT'S LIKE YOU ASKED WHAT IS THE MEANING OF SANDWICH
TINY TOWNE ISLAND :
One sec !
On July 22 instead of eating pie , I'm just going to sort of rub pie around my face and call it a day !
At a speed of over eight hundred thousand kilometers an hour , no less !
So now this angry woman is surrounded on all sides by chicken wings .
And what happens ?
Hey , here's an INCREDIBLE fact : go on any set , yell " Robots , ENGAGE OMEGA DIRECTIVE ALPHA ! " , and the director will love you for life ! !
I represent Heidegger ! Watch as I stomp on " the little guy " who's just trying to understand my seemingly purposely obscure philosophical writing !
" Also she uses singular and plural noun forms , but WE also have one for 'double' ! "
For instance , rather than taking out your garbage , I'll hang out with you and we can talk about entertainment franchises we have a shared interest in . Do you like the recent Star Trek series ?
But since it's dreams , we can kill all the spammers we want without consequence ! Then they wake up saying " Man I suck bad " or whatever it is spammers say when they look in the mirror at 3 in the morning .
BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE
Also I've got my trademark " nice calves " and " young smile " . I'm so old ! AND YET , I'm so sexy !
HOW TO USE TUMBLR
DO have a photo of you with a celebrity or dog in a fireman's hat !
I'm making this sound not as rad as it should be .
You'd also need total surveillance recording your every utterance !
I SEE PROBLEMS WITH THIS !
Man ! I miss OLD gangsta rap !
Yes , I have a fine wit !
I like that this is the one literary technique that has allowances for time travel .
But the result is that their stories don't have ENDS . We don't know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age , how Spider - Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks . I mean , we DO , because sometimes out - of - continuity stories explore this , but they're never for real - they don't count ! Bats is always 30 again in the next story . It's like David fights Goliath , but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years , and you never see how it ends .
T - Rex ! He's right nearby ! He can probably hear you .
Aw Man ! !
Tuggy & # 8217 ; s our only chance & # 8212 ; our last , best hope for survival . All of our tomorrows ride on the non - anthropomorphic shoulders of one Tuggy T . Tugboat , in space ! Will he be able to do it ? Will he be able to save us all and become our greatest hero ?
That was in a dream . A DREAM . I never actually punched out a turkey .
The Beach Boys . . . well , it seems the Beach Boys wish they were older , living together , and sleeping with each other .
T - Rex , if you want this thank - you to be good , you need to stop talking now .
Um , I just invented it ?
Hee hee ! It's funny , Dromiceiomimus , because sometimes in a song musicians get to rest for 32 bars , while here in the real world , we don't get to do that because we're not , um - trained musicians .
Now , HERE'S how putting the things in my mouth ties in with existence . . .
Okay , so peritonitis is when your peritoneum gets infected , and the peritoneum is basically the lining for your abdominal cavity , where your guts are ! So if that's infected , you're going to be in pain whenever your belly moves . And when the doctor walks in the room , he might see how you're sitting , cautious in your movements , guarding your belly , and he might suspect peritonitis . And then he might " accidentally " bump into your bed or chair !
< b > EVERYONE ELSE ON THIS WEBSITE SUCKS EXCEPT YOU AND ME < / b >
No thank you ! !
SOON !
I haven't read the books but , you know ? PROBABLY .
I want to dream about things I CAN'T otherwise experience : new colours and impossible shapes and sounds my ears could never process ! In dreams my brain is decoupled from my limited senses ; why doesn't it get ON this ?
The flesh underneath is stretched and brittle and dry !
Love is just a feeling ! A CHEMICAL STATE . We don't need to deify it !
YES , I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
THE COSO ARTEFACT
It's the beauty of life , T - Rex ! You can't really know anyone , even in the present , except for yourself !
THE SIX STAGES OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE
" Macbeth was a king , I think ? And his wife made him murder . . . someone . . . because . . . there's witches ? "
If you squeeze anything hard enough , poop will come out . That's not a secret .
SOON , T - REX IS PITCHING HIS IDEA TO A PUBLISHER :
Oh , um , I was sort of making fun of talking about feelings , but we can actually talk about them too . This is because I am a Good Friend !
It must be so different !
No problem ! Try dropping a twist tie into your garbage cans BEFORE you put the bag in . When you remove the bag , the tie will be there waiting for you !
I think the Dromiceiomimus has a crush on me !
What ? Not again !
I have a Theory about conventional western civilization being infatuated with a cartoonish idea of femininity .
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE A TINY BATMAN HEAD AROUND YOU YESTERDAY
We already do , dude .
Isn't that WEIRD ?
SOUND LIKE ANYONE YOU KNOW ? ?
" . . . Assuming you're down with smooching me , I mean . "
Total sass .
Man , they can kick LIONS to death ! One kick can shatter a lion's SKULL . That's ultimate badass !
Autotheism is the belief that you , personally , are divine . You're a god !
Nihilism ?
I just discovered that I can get digital prints for only 29 cents !
It's always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did .
Okay okay okay STAY COOL JUST - JUST STAY COOL . WE can learn about landing airplanes really fast . Dromiceiomimus , can you pull up Wikipedia real quick ? Tell me if there's a " how to land an airplane it's an emergency " article , and if there's not , then why not ?
Well , someone needs to get them ALL into mature , adult relationships then ! Like , yesterday !
Luckily , there is a solution .
IT'S ACTUALLY FRIDAY
PAST T - REX :
Vegetarians are chicks and dudes who don't eat a lot of meat for some reason or whatever !
But WTF is already an invented acronym .
I have a friend who has a problem , and that problem is that she is one of many with
Van Gogh painted it , it's kinda trippy . Let's imagine it right now !
CUT !
Um - wow .
Stand up straight !
That's what SHE said !
Man . . . after what happened yesterday , I guess there is a certain tension between myself and the Utahraptor . Well , I'm going to make sure that tension ends . . .
HAPPY EARTH DAY ! ! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PEE IN THE OCEAN
The idea is that crudely - realized characters don't look like real people , but we can see some qualities of real people in them , so they're cute ! But as you add more and more realism without quite reaching perfection , you reach a point where suddenly instead of cartoons that look real , they're real people who look TERRIBLY WRONG . Cuteness is replaced with the same reaction we'd have to putrid , retching , animated corpse : revulsion , and question is " Why ? ? " .
HEY T - REX I BET YOU FIFTY BUCKS YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE ENLIGHTENMENT IN THE BUDDHIST SENSE
And Ant a career in financial services ?
Hah hah ! I did NOT ! What would that be , anyway ? You both on your backs , slapping your legs together in the air ?
FINE . They can be called " autosexual " and people who only like themselves will be " solosexuals " .
I'm partial to " sandwich artist vs . sandwich " but am willing to entertain argument made in favour of " spaceship vs . cooler spaceship " .
And now , Italian food is basically defined by the tomato !
I have some UNSOLICITED OPINIONS about what you should name your offspring !
Perhaps you've ALSO simultaneously forgotten how we all agreed to change his name to Shakespeare to make it less super dumb ? ?
Dear mental diary : everyone here sucks . Maybe I should take my act to the grocery store !
There comes a time in every life when thon decides to look up thon's name in the dictionary !
I don't ! !
I love [ SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON FACEBOOK TO UNLOCK WHO I LOVE ! THE ANSWER WILL UTTERLY DESTROY YOU ]
Maybe today is the day I meet the love of my life , but ONLY if I go to the supermarket , because that's where she is !
Um , NAME ONE SITUATION IN WHICH RADNESS ISN'T PRACTICAL ? ?
No . No , I am not buying racist portraits of celebs made out of boogers on toast .
Therefore , yes , it is possible to have too many friends !
A sassy cat from space who reliably sports a top hat under his fishbowl helmet !
Sounds like you should be taking this up with your brain , not with me !
. . . but to attribute that thinking to yourself just because you're aware of it is an awful big leap for a skeptic to make !
That's corny , T - Rex .
Don't worry T - Rex , this is an entirely traditional procedure .
Damn it , archaeologists !
Are we seriously trying to come up with things that vanilla extract is symbolic for ?
So it's a lesbian to the French and a gay dude to the Polish ?
BLACKJACK AS SHE IS PLAYED
Tonight is a good night I think for having Chick Peas in Coconut Milk for dinner !
NO MAN I CHANGED MYSELF SO I CAN LIFT IT AND NOW I'M SO RIPPED THAT WHEN I FLEX MY SHIRT TEARS OPEN
You don't understand ! It's a really good salad !
Another good name is " Utahraptor " !
THURSDAY , JULY 7TH , 1994 : 8 : 04 AM . T - REX IS RUNNING TO CATCH A BUS .
You can get dwarf ELEPHANTS . Tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks !

Since WHEN ? !
I'm afraid I'll have to insist !

" I'd like you to meet my friend , " Sherlock Holmes announced . " He's another out - of - copyright character ! " Then he dramatically pulled back the stage curtain to reveal . . .
Artificial languages have been tried before , T - Rex !
Oh , hold on , I'm not done yet .
This sled allows access to millions of complicit families , all within a single 24 - hour period !
Mi parolas Esperanton !
How old is Little Red Riding Hood , like , four ? Six ? She wouldn't know how to operate one . Besides , their interiors are scaled for adults . No , she proceeds as she normally does .
Hey ladies !
I'd be more concerned with the chance our universe is a lot OLDER than we think , not younger !
Millions of years later , intelligent life arises again ! Your stones have long since weathered to dust , but they do find your skeleton and put it in a museum ! The placard reads " This Guy , Hey , what was The Deal With This Guy ? "
I think it's supposed to be taken in a " his suffering is over " sort of way .
G - great ?
the conversation !
Sherlock Holmes playfully hit the shoulder of figure hunched over his desk . " You aren't writing another one of your stories about me are you , SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE ? "
Gosh , am I the ultimate friend ? I am supportive and a good listener ! I do favours and care and keep track of everything that's going on in my friends' lives .
OBSERVE : " The writer , me , was sexy . I look to the left : a mirror . I'm in it . Still crazy hot , obvs . I look ahead and see the words I'm writing : 'The writer , me , was sexy . ' " .
Gotta round that up to a win !
Q E D BABY
" I can stay up here longer than you can , " Brussels smirked . " We're in the death zone , above the line where there's enough oxygen in the air to sustain us . I've got my top secret Everest base to return to . But you . . . you've only got the oxygen you're carrying , Angola . "
Yep ! It's a neurological distraction affecting the pathways between the central nervous system and the motor neurons , dishibiting any tonic ( i . e . : baseline ) inhibitions . DOCTORS , huh ?
TIME IS RUNNING BACKWARDS :
Hahaha , suck on that THE PAST .
Oh , I thought you were referring to the 1890s hits : you know , the songs that are MEGA FORGOTTEN because EVERYONE WHO LOVED THEM IS DEAD NOW ? ? Incidentally , the same fate that awaits even the BIGGEST , SHINIEST TUNE from the 1990s ? ?
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT ? ?
Well maybe he just decided to write a book that he entirely disagreed with .
. . . Metaphorically ?
THE MAN WHO ATE HIS HAT AND THEN PUNCHED YOU
Well , how ARE you not a monster ?

Good sir , my heart is aflutter ! I will do as you ask .
me in particular ! !
DAMN IT , AUGUST
OIL OF OLAY
Some Like It Friggin' Hot ?
Oh , Dromiceiomimus , you're already out and about !
It's just something I have to take care of , you know ?
Under the couch ! Of all the places for a lost baby to be . . .
Look , calm down ! You've made this far without thirsting to death .
Sure it would ! If you & # 8217 ; re all & # 8220 ; I perceive the world slowly , allowing me more reaction time & # 8221 ; , wouldn & # 8217 ; t this conversation be slowed down ? Wouldn & # 8217 ; t everyone look like statues and sound like dull rumbles when they open their mouths ?
I'm not ! I don't !
So maybe it's time we drop the act , huh ? When someone whips out a camera , instead of smiling , give it that " oh wow you just whipped out a camera " look .
Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered . . . viable ?
TWENTY - THOUSAND YEARS IN THE FUTURE :
Then I would like for you to create . . . A ROCK SO HEAVY THAT YOU COULD NEVER LIFT IT ! !
Oh ! Just idly speculating that if you define immortality as " living as possible to live " , then if I were somehow responsible for the complete destruction of the universe , I'd EFFECTIVELY be immortal . I'd have lived for as long as it was possible to , until the UNIVERSE ITSELF was lost !
Hate ?
I don't believe that's the case ?
Woo ! Back to school !
today's reprise :
No , I meant the rhetorical " you " .
Have you tried sexing him up ?
This is cheating : you've got a market segment that thinks GOD LITERALLY WROTE THIS BOOK AND NOW LITERALLY WANTS YOU TO BUY IT , and worse , that THE ACTUAL 100 % LEGIT RULES FOR HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE ARE CONTAINED WITHIN . Total unfair market advantage . It's ridiculous .
DO YOU HAVE AIDS , T REX
. . . but now they're giving it TWO . Aaaaand INSTAKISS .
So I'm going to go back and read tons of " Life in the World of Tomorrow " articles from centuries past , and find the one dude who was the closest to being accurate .
Oh YEAH ? Well ,
No , but if it happens I've already got my opinions totes prepared !
I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO IMPLY A CHILD'S LOSS AND NOT AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
You miss one song in particular that you listen to twice a day really loud ?
I wonder what the future holds !
Take the Bible , for instance !
" Suddenly this was all a dream and everyone was sexual again , THE END . "
Oh no ! ! A mad professor has turned economics , which even ECONOMISTS know is the most dismal of sciences , into a real person ! And now she's following me around !
BUT WHY ?
It's an insurance policy for personal development ?
I thought cephalopods were underwater animals !
Seriously ? You're seriously arguing this old idea .
IS IT TRUE THAT CANNIBALS DON'T EAT CLOWNS BECAUSE THEY TASTE FUNNY ?
I feel as though I haven't considered enough information in order to form a defensible point of view !
Let's not rush into this !
IS THE WHOLE POINT OF RACES
It's a genetic disorder that causes muscles and connective tissue to literally change to bone . As more and more tissue becomes bone , joints become fused and the inflicted person is eventually left ossified and completely unable to move ! Attempts to remove the extra bone simply result in further bone growth . It is a very painful disease and there is no cure , BUT , the gene that causes it has recently been found , which gives us hope !
Pretty awesome ones , you mean !
T - oh my gosh !
This is because I've just composed the Perfect Haiku . It has intrigue , a cold night , and perhaps , a hint of gunplay ?
NO , OKAY , NOW YOU'RE " COOL BOD TODD "
a comic to be used on dates that aren't going very well
Good one !
FINE . It was the worst juice , everyone . IT had guts in it !
Yes , it's a wonderful place . Come with me , as I reveal to you our world of magic and whimsy .
From his lunar base . . .
But - but . . .
FREE WILL
Crazier : there's probably a greater mass of HeLa cells now than there was of Henrietta when she was alive !
And it would be TOTALLY RAD if this record was all really exceptional people . Like if I lived millions of years ago , only I was a mutant with a fully - formed extra hand growing out of the base of my spine ! If I was the only specimen from the time , we might conclude that EVERYONE had butt hands then , and that would be provably hilarious . Then I thought : maybe we're already doing this !
It is true that as a dinosaur , the T - Rex should have been inclined toward gnashing his ferocious jaws and making claws of his little hands , but he had been stomping on things for so long that no one remembered a time when he had gnashed instead of stomped .
FRIENDSHIP CANCELLED FOREVER
At your side stands Julius Caesar and King Arthur himself , Excalibur at the ready ! To his left -
EVOLUTION
He fills the giant satellite dish thingy with water and dumpts it on the other robots . Earth is saved !
And did you know , Dromiceiomimus that in the most recent book Harry's friend RON WEASLEY ends up asphyxiated on the moon ?
Utahraptor if you ever wanted me to talk you up , I'D do it ! Check it :
So maybe I'm Batman and I break the law and I get caught but I had a really good reason . I'm going to hope that the police take that into account ! I'm BASICALLY going to hope for selective enforcement of the law . But that's kind of a terrible thing to hope for : it puts the law in the hands of an individual police officer , with all their preconceptions and prejudices !
I DON'T REALLY DO BATTLE THAT OFTEN
. . . which I guess means they paid for their sexism with THEIR VERY LIVES ? ?
Well , no , one reason really : early on a ship reported seeing land there and we put it on maps , but in that time period we didn't know about optical illusions or how sailors lie sometimes . That's all !
There's a boxing kangaroo at the circus ?
Okay , forget sonnets with their rules nested within rules ! You know what's easy ? FREE VERSE .
Would you really have been happy if the car got stolen ?
i dunno t - rex can you teach me to write like YOUR MOM ? ?
Are you doing anything tonight ?
Today is a good day I think to reminisce about the past !
comedy , ballet , coding , lobstering , economics , marriage , science , doubt , love , dying , selling , twerking , painting , music , beatboxing , and director rotation are art . Without exception , everything I did yesterday , including breathing , eating , napping , and loafing ! Nice !
Maybe you can just enjoy music and not try to make money off it by playing it oddly ?
The fact that you call her " an alive physical woman " says you have tons of unresolved issues ; I suggest you work those out first .
When I saw someone writing a cuss , I would think " It's okay , that person will have troubles down the line because of that , and then they'll realize why , and then they'll know not to write down cusses anymore . They will have learnt their lesson . " But I wrote down some cusses last night and nothing bad happened !
What's the deal ?
PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES ?
Extreme ! !
I am too , T - Rex ! It's going to be great .
Really ? Are you serious ? ?
Pansexual :
Things were just going that way ! But who knows what tomorrow will bring for me , T - Rex ?
That sounds terrible .
Man , who follows a compass ?
I've heard other people doing this before you , my friend !
OH MY GOD . I just realized that yesterday when Utahraptor said " universal panacea " , he was using a pleonasm !
Flip the table ! FLIP THE TABLE ! !
" Why was he so concerned with what was shakin' with the dudes ? "
Then they rub their faces on the carpet .
Oh my gosh , it's that jerky guy , eating alone . . . and he's picking his nose !
Does it have to work ?
We can fly if we've got an airplane wrapped around us , anyway !
And there's bases that go higher , too !
I can't believe we're all descended from 17th century people ; how embarrassing !
HERE'S A GOOD WAY :
Way to go , Prometheus !
JUDGING WOMEN BY THE USE OF THEIR NAME IN SONGS
EVERY
Well , alright then . I admint that I do find it a little weird when you pronounce " aunt " the same as " ant "
Right ! You all add up to a pretty great guy .
That's a perfect ten and luckily I reserved some extra points for this scenario , listen I gotta go lie down .
Okay ! Time to get down to some squashing ! Hey . . . what gives ? What's with the word balloon and the jester regular font ?
The number of people who could be here , in my place , outnumber the sand grains of Sahara . If you think about all the different ways in which our genes could be permuted , you and I are quite grotesquely lucky to be here . The number of events that had to happen in order for you to exist , in order for me to exist . . .
These stories wouldn't happen to be FAKE stories , would they ?
Right ?
Exactly ! That way the " goodness " of a voter will directly impact how much their vote is worth !
Man ! I COULD make a better dating site ! !
T - Rex , a whore is someone who has sex for money .
THAT HAPPENED ONCE
Oh , that's too bad !
Then , like you , I felt the regrets
Not lexicalized ; doesn't count !
That is technically true !
Nope ! Love is selfISH . You see value in someone , and they see value in you ! You want access to this value , so you arrange a spiritual exchange .
Frig , wait ! No I didn't ! !
NO , not on account of my many FEELINGS . I decided I'm happy for her , but I don't want for HER to think that I'M upset , and I'm focusing so much on that that I'm acting weird around her .
And let's say , conservatively , that we're awake eight hours a day !
T - REX I ASK YOU FOR ON THING YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE BROADCAST INTO THE MINDS OF EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE
These metrics are simplified , as natural immunity is not factored into N . Different compartmental epidemic models may provide different results !
AHHHHHHHHH
Homeboy owes me 30 bucks !
Sooo weird !
You know what ? That doesn't bother me , because I'm starting my own T - Rex rumour ! Tell your friends that I stomp things because WHENEVER I kiss someone , they always pull away , smile , give me a double thumbs up , and then run off over the horizon yelling " Totally radical ! ! "
There you are ! I need my gardening shovel back .
You're gross . Bill Cosby is a man .
I GUESS I COULD READ YOUR DIARY IF I WAS FEELING SUPER LAZY
Wouldn't it be great if rhetoric had evolved in the same way ? I could have this hyper - evolved speaking that could convince anyone to do whatever I say , as long as they didn't have similar rhetorical powers to match ! Anyone not inured to my amazing powers of speechifying would be putty in my hands . " Oh , T - Rex , I'm not sure I should do this " they'd say , and then I'd say " Oh maybe you should though " and they'd be all , " Awesome . "
Did he or didn't he ? This is a question asked in many murder mystery stories , ESPECIALLY those involving a male suspect . People really want to know if he did or didn't ( DO THE MURDER ACT , THAT IS . )
Oh my goodness !
Well , you CAN , but then they won't be your friends anymore .
GET A DRINK T - REX
Well , actually , no , that's not true . Factually , it is just a country in North America . Canada is literally just a country in North America .
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY TRUE ? ?
I used to be better at imagination
Well , my friend : that depends . Did I die in a funny way ? For instance , did I smoke a cigarette , and then my eyes exploded ?
POSSIBLE BUT BORING .
That's it Rex ! You're a loose cannon and I want your gun and badge ! !
I respectfully disagree ! !
HOPE YOU'RE NOT AT WORK , PERVO
This means I should exist for my own sake , neither sacrificing myself to others , nor sacrificing others to myself ! The pursuit of my own rational self interest , and happiness , is the highest moral purpose of my life !
Haha , okay , man . You're at a party or a conference and you're obsessed with networking . And nobody wants to talk to you and you can't figure out why ?
We are GIANT DINOSAURS who have taken the time to INVENT BULLETS .
I do actually think that's pretty manly .
" Explosions have been going off all over town , and the culprit has escaped justice . "
It's not manipulative ! It's ADORING .
Hah hah , SWEET . Sorry it's not working out , bidisillusioned dude ! !
But I think comedy changes more than most . We can read serious writing from centuries ago and the arguments are WAY more accessible than any jokes .
You can't fit any of these ! You only have a mere two knuckles per hand , dude !
* sigh * Utah who ?
You and your eleven closest friends go camping . You wake up to discover the floor is lava ! But there's rocks too , and they alternate back and forth in a checkerboard pattern !
BACKSTORY : UTAHRAPTOR WAS CRASHING ON THE COUCH LAST NIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS LATE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CAB HOME . ALSO , DOUG KNEW ABOUT THIS . DOUG IS A FRIEND OF UTAHRAPTOR'S . HE CALLED ON SPEAKERPHONE . T - REX IS SPENDING THIS PANEL SASSING THE WAY DOUG TALKS BUT LOOK AT ME . I NARRATED ALL OVER IT .
Then , wouldn't that be a biography ?
Pfft . NO , he went BACK in time . He set his time machine to " long ago , far away " and ended up here . No wait ! ! The CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN set the controls to that .
This will serve 6 - 8 alive humans , most of whom will readily consume this product so long as you don't ever show them this recipe !
Let's say I have a cat !
It was nuts ! I never had such a stereotypical dream before . I got in an assignment late and was trying to convince the professor to accept it , only he didn't want to and kept critiquing my penmanship . Also the assignment was on pink paper . I think it was the only paper I had !
OR WAS IT ? ?
That was awfull . Your " music " is against gods divine plan .
The first tip is this : never ever ask if a woman is pregnant , because she might not be pregnant and then not only have you just called her fat , you've just implied she has a glow as if LIFE ITSELF is developing inside her body .
Dromiceiomimus , I have a great idea for our act : let's put on a play !
In this fallacy , you present an altered version of your opponent's argument in order to make it appear absurd ! You then tear apart this weaker , ridiculous argument and claim victory . Basically it can be summarized as " make stuff up and attribute it to your opponent " ! Haha ! EXCELLENT .
HILARIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS COMICS
Would it not be pretty neat to average out your emotional states across your entire life ?
Sorry , was that to eager ?
SO YOUR FRIENDS ARE GETTING PREGNANT
Right ? !
SUDDENLY , T - REX HAS NO IDEA WHAT TO SAY ! IT IS THE AWKWARD MOMENT PROMISED IN THE TITLE CARD .
I dunno ! At some fuzzy point if would switch for most observers from " heap " to , say , " small pile " , and there we can draw the line . Language isn't that precise .
Yeah , why wouldn't that be the case ?
BUT , my idea is actually DIFFERENT . Because what if these universes all exist at once , right now , regularly spaced throughout an inifinitely - huge multiverse ? Instead of infinite time , infinite space . Then trillions and trillions of kilometres away from me in every direction is another universe , with another me !
Arguably , yes !
Through despair and hope .
A FEW HOURS LATER
No problem ! Now is it finally time to have fun ? Now can I get what I want out of this friendship ?

T - REX DID YOU KNOW THAT THE KILOGRAM IS ONE OF THE FEW UNITS OF MEASUREMENT STILL DEFINED BY A PHYSICAL OBJECT
Why stop there , T - Rex ? There's also " you know what " , " you know how " , and " you know when " .
And he would have no idea why suddenly all these people are making out with him ! From behind !

MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE ALL PROVERBS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT :
HEY UTAHRAPTOR
Okay , so the scene opens in a spaceship and it's the future ! The ship is this huge mechanical leviathan , all pipes and metal catwalks , unfriendly , imposing . And it's drifting in deep space ! The engines have overloaded and blown up . This is all explained in the opening musical montage , set to " Louie Louie " !
HEY CHECK IT OUT
Hello , and thank you for downloading an internet ! Perhaps you would like to look at pictures of cats ?
THEIR performances are lost , forever and ever . Entire lives spent perfecting their craft , and for what ? So that they could die before the advent of recorded sound ? ?
It shows up in our timeline ! You already used it : " bark " sounds like a dog bark !
I VOW
Isn't it great , Dromiceiomimus ?
But how would we write puns in such a language ?
I paddle really fast !
No . No - it's the regular kind I think . Well , anyway ! It's a good thing that you're poor enough that not all of your ambitions can be realized ! !
And before you ask , yes . Yes , I DO like 'em real wild AND / OR b - boy style .
You win this round of " Guess the famous person from their dating profile " !
DUH
presented using a primarily - male cast of dinosaurs
ABSOLUTELY .
Hey Dromiceiomimus , are you here to rap too ? / Because if that's the case , then I say : " coo' " !
And my OTHER dying wish , which'll be " MAN , I wish I wasn't dying right now . "
With awesome inflation , we acknowledge that " awesome " is now used to refer to merely above - average things , so " let the okay times roll " can now be expressed as " let the awesome times roll " .
ENDING ONE :
Not a problem , dude on speakerphone !
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS I HAVE SUPERPOWERS .
HOLD ON
THE MAMMOTH TANKS ARE ONE OF THE MORE POWERFUL UNITS IN THE GAME
Gradually stop loving that thing just a little bit more each day , ideally without even noticing ! Then one fine day you'll wake up and realize there's no grief ahead of you anymore , but only a grey , blank indifference .
And if that's true we're no more responsible for our actions than a computer is for executing code . We have no choice in what happens to us , and if you set up the universe in the exact same way , we'd make the same choices and the exact same things would happen . Free will is therefore an illusion ! Like a computer , WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS .
You know what'd be a big pain ? Translating all our many and varied laws into a new language . And you know what'd be an even bigger pain ? Picking another new language and doing it all again !
VISITING OLD FRIENDS COMICS
Utahraptor if you heard that it was the sound of my brain exploding at the thought of a lifetime of missed sexy opportunities
Oh man , I'm gonna work the phrase " little lower , little slower " into every conversation I have today !
Um , NOT ANYMORE
Of course it does ! Without it , you can't have fanfic !
" My heart has developed boners for this . "
Man forget punctuation forget it all to heck
Turns out master violinists practice every day because their skills fade as soon as they take a break ! And it takes such a long time to get to this elite level that it's a life choice they make way early on . These JERKS have known what they want to do with their lives since they were , like , SIX . That's ridiculous !
Computational linguistics is the study of computer - based language processing !
Then I'll probably have to explain that I had amnesia and the dentist will think I'm crazy .
When I see illegal billboards my instinct is not to call the city and register a complaint - my instinct is to tear it down ! And when I see a jerk sitting in a parked car at night , projecting an ad on the side of a building , I don't want to call the police and report a citizen acting against the best interests of EVERY OTHER CITIZEN with the exception of himself . I want to disable his projector ! And by " disable " I mean " fully destroy " ?
DO NOT LISTEN TO FRANK .
It IS pretty unlikely that you'd be made to call us under duress !
Oh , she fell in love with a bull and so hid inside a fake hollow bull in order to have sex with the bull .
Dude I don't want to sound weird or anything but MAN it must be so fun to be rich sometimes !
Dromiceiomimus , I'm sorry I thoguht your name was " Emily " .
So many wasted years spent in non - Norse society .
My table ! She is so flipped ! !
I have surprised even myself !
teeheehee - HIGH RES VERSION DO NOT DELETE . tiff !
Is the entire script based on computer puns ?
And that's just where it starts . After my would - be heirs spend the night in the haunted house , which is clearly specified in my will to be ACTUALLY HAUNTED , they have to successfully navigate a series of dares and challenges - punching bears , eating chairs , that sort of thing - all designed to bring them together and underline a valuable life lesson : " MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING " . Then they get the money .
Babe you got < center > tags all over and your shit's all deprecated / With such sloppy markup language , can't BELIEVE we ever dated
Dromiceiomimus , there you are !
I KNOW ; I JUST SAID IT WAS REALLY EASY
Aw FRIG , now the penguin has eaten the tiger !
Well , isn't this one of those topics that you'd talk about with friends in private , but not while out in a public place ? You don't want people to think you're a PEDOPHILE .
I - Okay ?
I'm not sure I can ! I'd have to explain a lot about us in order for me to articulate why it seemed so unusual . I'm guessing she was just upset with something else , and wasn't in the mood for any of my shenanigans ?
huh .
I dreamt I was a cockfighter !
Hello and welcome to Wow I Guess You Just Had A Kid : Parenthood 101 . Raise your hand if your actions have caused a tiny alive person to come out of your body , or the body of someone else !
UM I LIKE IT FOR THE SEX T - REX
Do you feel good for having done it ?
Aha , my friend , but once again I said " the ultimate friend " , not " the utimate pushover " ! But I'll still do your dishes sometimes , if I'm there !
I said a hip , a hop , a hippie , a hippie -
I can do the saddest FIVE word story : " For sale : baby shoes , unworn " !
SEE THIS IS WHAT I TOLD YOU T - REX JUST BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS SUPERMAN AND " JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET "
That's too transparent , Dromiceiomimus .
I am sick of cold , emotionally distant women !
Going to the dentist means lying down and baring your teeth and paying a stranger to scrape at them : kinda sucky at the best of times . But then I realized !
Why weren't people rapping until ony a few decades ago ? Did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop , and then not stop ?
That as well .
I guess , but what about the child ?
Everyone needs a bio on Twitter Dot Com Slash Your Twitter Name ! Well , everyone who signed up for Twitter .
Assemble all my work and bring it to the ocean .
AAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH
An insanely great sense of smell ? Sign me up !
. . . Really ? That's how we're playing this ? I'm proposing a fanciful law to get out of GAS EMBARRASSMENT , and you're Mister Hey Guys , I'm Gonna Bring Up Serious Incidents of Possible Sexual Assault .
T - REX ARE YOU THE SASSIEST DINOSAUR
And it totally doesn't count to say I already have an accent !
But - I stayed up all night working on the celebrated and unmentionable Nutrinomicon .
That is a good question
He'll no longer be a teen . It's a disaster ! He's TERRIFIED . He's waking up in cold sweats . Billy's certain that when he becomes 20 he'll lose something vital of himself .
So , yeah , he started getting kinda strong . Not unrealistically strong , because the dog that bit him wasn't THAT tough , but he was at least , you know , above average . He was pretty strong .
You've got to SELL it , T - Rex ! Ocean doesn't cover 71 % of the planet . 71 % of our planet's fround hates us SO MUCH that an unprotected visit to it means INSTANT and UNESCAPABLE DEATH .
At least all the copies at the library , yep !
Okay . Has anyone over 40 won the Abel prize ?
It sounds like a fun story , T - Rex !
T - Thanks ?
To die , to sleep - no more !
Oh - kay ! Socialism is when people share the means of production and stuff . Everyone works together for the common good !
Yeah , or work on their Life Challenges ! I think you're FINE .
Nice work , Telephone Tim !
Then dudes , come on ! ! It's time to get inspired !
So not only are HeLa cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings ( going from a multi - celled life form to a singe - celled one ) but they're also maybe a first example of immortality : her cells live , but the woman from whom the cells were taken , Henrietta Lacks , died from this cancer in 1951 . That's crazy !
Well . . . OK ! Let's hug !
Soon they discovered a woman dangling above a pool of acid !
What are they like ?
I can magically change myself into a raptor .
If I pick nine , you'd better not be racist against me !
They'll be all , " GOTO TEN IF YOU WANT TO LIVE "
" Quick , Professor ! ! " Mel begins . So far so good !
Once upon a time there was a genie who chilled in a lamp !
. . . Wait , hold on ! That name offends even me ! !
Yeah , but when you open it , it's actually a robot version of me , and I'm shooting red lasers from my eyes that spell out " HAPPY MOTHERS DAY " !
If we accept that all perspectives are equally non - binding , then intellectual or moral arrogance will determine which perspective has precedence !
That's what some people are like , Dromiceiomimus ! !
Tomorrow , I start in my new employ .
But isn't that terrible symbolism ? " Mom is dirty and cannot be trusted ; baby must be sterilized NOW no matter how clean Mom says she is "
Whoah ! Consider my mind blown , then !
I want to be able to forgive a complete stranger , but I don't want to be taken advantage of either .
I think bacon is just okay ! I think captioned cat pics are funnier with proper grammar ! I think the Star Wars prequels are indistinguishable from the other ones !
NEXT TIME , ON DINOSAUR COMICS : SOME UNEXPECTED SUCCESS .
. . . Sometimes , with the finest ideas , it is truly impossible to tell ! !
Dromiceiomimus ! I've come up with a new saddest thing ever !
I was joking !
. . . Wow .
Dromiceiomimus ! Do you think me and my little green arms are cute , or do they rather inspire a chilling fear in your very SOUL ?
That's the fifth pool this week , and no millionaires !
You are an awesome dude and we should play beachball sometime soon !
" Steve was seven hot feet tall . His chest was whatever way you like a dude's chest to be , only MORE so . Suddenly he was murdering another beefy dude . OMG these dudes . "
Well , that's not true . I'd read a lot more drama , and I'd be really into that drama , and then SUPER into that drama , and then SUPER SUPER into that drama , and then suddenly not into the drama at all and reaaaal sleepy .
Hooray for pals !
If you're being chased by a vampire , cross a bridge !
But what if I'm awesome at set design while also truly despising all aspects of set design ?
It went fine !
FINE !
So I should assume that you're a disingenuous and unhelpful jerk .
TELEPATHIC HOTTIE CHAT :
The book's slogan is , " Think Like Me , While You're Imagining Sex . "
" Oh , were we dating ? "
Hello everybody ! I'm back in the present , after going way the heck back in time to kill a great dictator for the common good !
. . . Kiss whom ?
I guess the old stereotype of boys liking trains is true !
PRINT THIS COMIC OUT AND DISTRIBUTE IT TO EVERYONE'S DESK WITHOUT EXCEPTION
It reminds me of this friend I had in high school who could never ever detect sarcasm , no matter what . It's such a small thing , but it would come up all the time when I'd be like , " oh , no , please , no more ketchup ! " and then I wouldn't get any more ketchup when I actually wanted some more ketchup .
I could make some changes ! But did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though ?
I stomped on people while talking about how sad it is when bad things happen ! This is an example of " dramatic irony " .
Among other places , yes .
Shakespeare , if you spell " assume " differently , you'll stop future generations from making that stupid " ass out of u and me " joke !
Which theory ?
I love punch ! I love drinking delicious punch , PROBABLY because of how it's so delicious .
Hee hee ! It's a good day to be T - Rex !
No ! Not being a Utahrapt -
Nope ! Technology has advanced since boat times , Dromiceiomimus . They avoid the asteroid easily . Plus , you can see along way in space so nothing really sneaks up on you , you know ?
Is there one where you get to choose your animal ? 'Cause I'd be all over " hummingbird " !
I'm just not feeling that motivated , you know ? Maybe I'll just get a fast food burger .
P . S . THIS IS A LEGALLY - BINDING DOCUMENT
How about " T - Rex : Your Shortcomings and Regrets , Personified ! "
It's a " Choose Your Own Adventure " book ?
Not much . Did you guys REALLY stand under running water once a day just so you wouldn't stink as much ?
YES ! We love you .
" But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lusts . Then when lust has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when sin is accomplished , it brings forth death . " James 1 : 14 - 15
Beartato ! Help ! !
I invented computers ! !
And that means they believe they've been replaced by a duplicate ?
I had ten whole chickens , Dromiceiomimus . Mmm - MMM !
Maybe with a li'l tongue ?
Fine ! It worked for Mr . Saskatoon !
" In the beginning , God created the Heaven and the Earth . In my opinion , I mean , and I'm probably totally wrong ! "
It's time to face facts . I've picked up - how do I say this delicately - " an expensive habit " ?
Okay , take your current age and divide it by six ! Now you're a kid again !
Dromiceiomimus , what's your opinion on people who are naked ?
Geez why not start a sandwich company called " Hovercars 4 Free " while you're at it , GOOGLE
Because it's classy ?
That's a pretty okay weakness to have , isn't it ?
aw come on you guys it's mine
And THAT , cats and kittens , is how you win a conversation about programming languages . Now , I'm free to eat ice - cream sandwiches !
I WANNA GET LAID !
It's time for me to start blowing up planets that orbit distant red suns and expose others to gamma radiation and cosmic rays , just in case !
Do you have anything to add . . . about AD SLOGANS ? ?
But once you see it you can't unsee it . It's this new form of terrible , insecure , needy writing , and yet it's suddenly EVERYWHERE .
Well , that's from the 90s , so - yeah . They're out there . They may even be friends !
Eh , Dromiceiomimus ?
Get it , Dromiceiomimus ? It's clever because it sounds like " Bruce Wayne " but nobody would realize it unless they said it out loud . Everything is similar but different in MY comic !
Who's inane ?
Greatness requires blindness , and we know WAY too much about everybody now !
You're doomed to lose a non - trivial amount of time , and it's not like it's going to happen in some super interesting way . The only novel way to lose is by dying in real life , but you only get to do that ONCE , and if you do , your last words are " Oh look , a four of hearts . I can put that on the three of hearts . "
You think it could be different ?
People say that
Also , we're dudes !
Most of my relationships have been " complicated " .
THIS CANNOT BEEE ! ! ! ! !
Okay . Here we go !
And those who cannot remember to attribute their quotations are condemned to commit academic offences .
Nor does she say " Mirror mirror on the wall , how can clean energy be provided for all ? " or even " Mirror mirror mounted here , how can chicks and dudes have satisfying careers ? "
What's the matter ? Are you shocked a SHOCKED that a woman could be an engineer ?
CUT AND SAVE !
But I don't mention anything about semantic externalism !
T - REX DUDE I THINK YOU MAY HAVE A HERNIA
It could also just mean non - stop legal proceedings .
APPARENTLY CRIME PAYS A REASONABLE AMOUNT SOMETIMES ? ?
" Rolling over and kissing Christmas " ?
I AM .
I've been systematically destroying the life I knew , but that's just left me panicky and unsatisfied . My romance for something new has led to a realization that I had a routine because I liked what I was doing and when I was doing it .
All I need now is a female T - Rex with similar interests !
FINE . That's why I'm coming .
Oh , is this one of those dumb Conspiracy Secrets , wherein fluoride is actually designed to induce pregnancy in freshly married women or something ?
Oh my gosh it's going to be so great ! To watch once in a while at parties I mean , not to live it 24 / 7
Can we avoid this conversation if I say my favourite food is sweet and sour chicken ?
These could be classified equally well as " idioms involving abstract concepts somehow granted agency " .
Our friendship is doomed ! !
The number of Spider - men depends on the number of real - life superpower - granting spiders , which I'm pretty sure is zero . The number of Hulks depends on the number of gamma bomb blasts granting superpowers , which , again : zero .
Yep ! I really like it though . Anyway , what's your favourite weather ? Hail ? TORNADOES ?
Who are you talking to , T - rex ?
Oh hell !
Amazing !
And SOMETIMES these little secrets accidentally become BIG SECRETS , because I never told the people I should have about them and it's too late now .
T - Rex , this is entirely terrible !
The wind blew it away . Listen : I'm working on it .
What are the odds a six - year - old would know what a thirty - year - old wants to do ?
But you know what they say : the best characters write themselves , and as an ARTISTE , I can't control that .
Well , I'D invite him over for dinner ! We'd have chops !
Dromiceiomimus , happy birthday ! You are still entriely excellent .
How is it racist ? Is the apple - hater of a minority creed or socio - economic group ?
We all know nobody can read all the books being printed . Throw on top of that all movies , websites , people posting on social media , and it's like - who are y'all producing all this culture for ? Seriously . Who ?
DOUG IS SHAVING OFF HIS HITLER MUSTACHE
You don't have a ROUTINE of passing out in front of TV after work . T - Rex : You have a tradition !
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX IS A PROFESSIONAL SINGER :
Morbidly funny image , though - makes you wonder what they were all doing there .
Hey ladies , who has no thumbs and can't even come up with a working definition of sex ? THIS GUY .
Religion can give hope of a kind and caring world beyond our absurd one . But since they see reason as the greatest tool we've got and religion relies on faith , it's rejected by the absurdists as a ( just as deadly ! ) PHILOSOPHICAL suicide .
T - REX IF YOU COULD SAY ONE SENTENCE TO YOUR PAST SELF WHAT WOULD IT BE
THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA
I'm sorry too , T - Rex !
So ? Problem solved !
The PaciFIST !
RIGHT . SO ON YOUR WAY TO THE SOUTH POLE , YOUR EXPEDITION GETS WORD THAT THIS NORWEGIAN GUY AMUNDSEN HAS A PARALLEL EXPEDITION TO THE SOUTH POLE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW .
Seriously man , quit joking around and WASH YOUR FRIGGIN' TOWELS .
Huh ?
I feel odd . . as if my amnesia is wearing off !
So I guess great titles include . . . prepositions and definite articles ?
Huh ? Oh , April Fool's . No , I just wanted some help moving something heavy .
The cards are written by followers of OTHER religions , to minimize stat inflation !
Oh man . The heart pounding out - of - the - chest " I'm in love " reaction shot !
I guess I just forgot that as soon as my hot water heater gets fixed , I instantly stop caring about hot water heaters forever
. . . of old age ?
A TV show where 25 men compete for one woman's love , or a TV show where 25 men compete for one woman's oxygen IN SPACE ? ? Please . Pass me the remote , we're watching that show forever now .

COMICS FOR HETEROSEXUAL MEN
No doubt it's a rad beast !
Awesome ! I get to be Marty !
THAT GENRE IS CALLED STEAMPUNK T - REX
Still ! Ouch !
There's all sorts of synesthesia : some people taste words and syllables when they say them - sometimes even if they just think them ! Others have distinct personalities associated with numbers or letters , so that the letter " M " might be polite while " 7 " gets all up in everyone's fries . They still sense normally , it's just they've got this extra layer of perception on top of what the rest of us get . I admit to being jealous !
YES . I CAME BACK TO WARN YOU : your John Spiderman story is sucky and dumb ! !
What if this sense of disenchantment came not from a flawed world , but rather a growing realization that they themselves are flawed ? Nothing's more depressing than realizing that you can't live up to your hopes , that you'll never live out your dreams , that you probably let those you care about down , everyday !
WHOAH
You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais , T - Rex ! That was a huge scam !
It's pretty great , Dromiceiomimus ! Sometimes I'll ask myself " What's Utahraptor probably doing this weekend ? " or " What would Dromiceiomimus do if she found out I ate all these chicken legs ? " and I use my friend simulators to asnwer these questions .
Dude ! I'm not buying a book where you insult me !
Yes ! NESTED WISHES PAYS OFF AGAIN . I've got infinite wishes ! !
Still big on rubber bands ?
Like !
METHOD 2 : ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY HAVE ANY SEXY FRIENDS THEY COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO !
T - REX HAS THE BEST IDEA EVER COMICS
It seems pretty hard !
It's , uh & # 8211 ;
I think we can all agree that as a popular culture shifts with time , there were some years that were great and there were some years that were way terrible .
It doesn't matter now !
It ensures a good write up , Dromiceiomimus !
Nope ! The problem is that the test doesn't prove consciousness , just communication , and um , it can be faked .
God ! About SITCOMS .
Then we cheat ! WE CHEAT BIOLOGY ITSELF .
That's a bunch of BALONEY !
JOKES FOR OFFICE WORKERS
She was so clearly this perfect , amazing woman , and I was honestly so confused by the fact that she wasn't swarmed with suitors , that I tried to examine her critically , looking for flaws that I hadn't seen before .
What if you only ate white - coloured things ?
Sure we can , T - Rex !
In other news !
T - Rex you went too far ! ! Your characters are now TOO original !
Aren't analogies usually non - literal ? He's clearly the gem diamond trade .
Please ! I'm gagging for it ! !
Actually I'm here to congratulate you .
The future sparkles with possibility , UTAHRAPTOR
Dromiceiomimus , how do you FEEL today ?
I don't know what to tell you , man !
Let us explore them . . . together !
Well . . . okay !
whooooaaahh
I have hope for you , my friend !
Oh , you mean the ones who PLAGIARIZE REALITY ITSELF and then have the gall to write " By me ! I wrote this ! " on the cover ?
Taste is kind of baloney , you guys !
I had the strangest dream last night . . .
I guess those really were Star Wars !
I exercised harder and longer than I have before , and I was so hot , and I was dying , and I wanted to die . I WANTED it . In my heart of hearts . . . I welcomed death , Utahraptor .
Burger King is where you can eat the breasts of chickens
EXACTLY . Miracles are common - place ! Improbable things happen , and given enough chances , even way super unlikely things will happen for sure !
Um , BESIDES THE EXTREMELY ELDERLY , OBVIOUSLY .
LIBRARIES : We Also Rent Movies Now Too
I didn't want to seem uptight about it ! It's something he should know by now , right ? But now it's quickly becoming a Thing .
HE BROKE UP WITH YOU BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU
You wound me !
Oh , Dromiceiomimus . Denied ! !
I can't believe I throw out revelations like this and nobody acts like it's amazing . I JUST MADE ALL HISTORY BOOKS SCIENCE FICTION PREQUELS .
And that means we don't know either . We hear distant shouting , but can't make out any words . Then the noise of - a dog ? A wolf ? Wait , maybe an elephant ? Oh man , are there elephants over there ? ?
T - Rex , your history lesson has no value !
Well , what is it ?
Haha , I guess I was being kind of silly !
Want to learn accounting but can only make yourself care about cute little puppy dogs ? Then welcome to
Ha ha ! That's WACKY .
ALSO SOMEBODY'S IN HERE
Don't tell my mom that I'm speaking , of course , of prostitution !
At the societal level !
Man , I don't need that sort of stuff in my mailbox ! I meant REAL emails .
But they're not semantically empty ! I do convey some small information , but words like " at most " or " fewer than " allow me all sorts of leeway !
Utahraptor , it's supposed to be famous people , not yourself ! !
And you might say , hey , EVENTUALLY one of 'em has to be boring . But that leads to paradox : our first boring number becomes interesting BECAUSE it's our first boring number ! Therefore , proof by contradiction , there's no such thing as a boring number , all numbers are interesting , and math is so cool .
Um , NOT FOR LONG
Glad to hear it , Dromiceiomimus !
Don't be sad ! Remember our slogan : You Be You ! ?
Says here this guy murdered a dude , AND , they're saying he liked a bunch of HEAVY METAL songs on Youtube . Coincidence ? ?
I feel very oddly about dead dogs right now
You're worried that there'll be a politician , an evil politician , and once you get a whiff of his chlorine scented ways your pupils will change into little cartoon swimming pools and you'll rush to the nearest polling station to vote for him .
WAIT HOLD ON WHAT - WHAT - I WASN'T LISTENING - WHAT
It has been a memorable day
Good news about gluten , everyone ! It's not an experimental nanocompound !
The sad thing is that the word is rarely used sincerely anymore - the only place you see it is in those sleazy newspapers with back - page advertisements for " bicurious teens ! " . Bicurious teens don't need to advertise !
SPANKSGIVING
A robot ? !
Get it ? If the sentence is true , then it's lying , which makes the sentence not true . But if the sentence isn't true , then it's lying , which makes the sentence true ! WELCOME TO PARADOX TOWNE , POPULATION : YOU . YOU LOOK AROUND PARADOX TOWNE AND SEE ONLY BALLS . OH CRAP . YOU FEEL YOURSELF GETTING CLUMSIER .
THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED :
Once upon a time Bonnie Tyler was falling in love , but now she's only falling apart !
T - Rex , this is a very terrible idea .
I would also accept copy invoking " out of this world " savings .
You know how in stories , whenever a character has the chance , he always decides that it's too dangerous to know too much about his own future ?
" I would enjoy this game much more if there was only one , or perhaps two , button ( s ) to press . "
" You are the luckiest person in the history of time , but unfortunately ONLY when it comes to pointlessly encountering this song in an unbroken daily streak " ?
OMG I'm reevaluating some life choices right now
I don't want to play your game . It sounds monstrous .
GLUTEN COMICS
How do you measure positive influence ? If I'd invented PEACE it would be easy . But peace was already totally invented when I was born ! Similarly , if I'd invented a machine that only causes pain , then it's easy to see that I'm probably a net drain on the planet .
This theory is called " phantom time " and I encourage you to research it !
The idea is that there's not too many diseases that can spread easily AND kill you overnight , because they're too effective : the infection wouldn't spread , and the disease dies .
But today some dude talking over the music is exactly what rap is - and not only do people think it's really good , but rappers DELIGHT in it !
What does that have to do with asteroids ?
More specifically , the area including my house !
with t - rex !
Emotions are for the weak !
Um , okay - boy meets girl , girl meets boy , boy meets boy , girl meets girl , boy meets . . . plant . . .
So I replied " haha okay " and shot him in the head . I call it , " The Time I Accidentally Spoke Polish To A Dude " !
GIVE ME A HUG .
A TALE OF TERROR
Ah , what a busy day . Time for me to go to bed and be naked and unconscious for , oh , about eight hours !
I can teach you how to dance !
Easy : my mom answers them !
Stop , you fool . You'll ruin everything !
Man , like that wasn't the first place I tried .
I NEED MONEY ? !
In 1837 , Oliver Twist began being serialized ! It had a . . . Twist ending ?
Oh snap , maybe ! !
I say , " Dude , feel free ! "
But , T - Rex , Thanksgiving was -
I'm a stranger with unsolicited opinions on how you should live your life .
Attention , everybody ! Can anyone send an email for me that reads " HEY MOM I ATE TOO MUCH LAST NIGHT LOL JK " ?
Large corporations will turn to these forecasters and say " what colours should we make dresses in the future " and they'll say " for a million dollars , I will tell you " and then they pay a million dollars because nobody wants to make dresses in the wrong colour ! Nobody has ever wanted that ! !
Yep ! Of course this has changed a little with the advent of grammar books and formal schooling , but it's still there . For example , I might think the word 'tenet' is enraging !
SEXT : we give each other's boobs nicknames : Flagrante + Delicto , Habeas + Corpus . U realize u should be studying for law school rn
Do you think everyone wants to be remarkable , T - Rex ?
Wait , hold on , I messed up the joke . Hold on .
So what did you do ?
Hey , I got my pictures developed , by the way !
THE ISLAND CONTINENT OF AUSTRALIA ? ?
The first law of thermodynamics :
Hey , it's no big deal . You can go to a clinic , or you can look up doctors in your area and make an appointment .
The end is near for Ryan North , and he knows it .
Great . Me and my wife'll meet you at the Nisti Drinker , say , around seven ?
Have you ever . . . PAID for food ?
Yep ! It's about a woman who desires something , then gets it and is pretty elated about the whole thing , but then , AFTERWARDS , she's pretty pissed .
Check out my new alternate history story : it's the 1920s , and flappers are super sexy , obvs ! But then the great depression happens and their ready - to - party - on - a - boat personalities and hedonistic YET SEXY lifestyles could not survive .
And that is a valid complaint ! I hate it when fictional universes are SO CLAUSTROPHOBIC that everyone's hanging out in the same swimming pool .
I have felt reflective of late . . .
For example : guys who get off on being inflated like balloons and then floating away . Hah hah ! So much for realizing THAT desire , Chuckles ! Skin isn't that elastic and people aren't positively buoyant in air , my friend ! !
Wait a minute , I recognize these !
Here is a hypothetical situation : let's say I'm married and going to have a child ( with my assuredly hott wife ) ! What should it be named ?
A memory from fifteen years ago woke me up last night .
Oh yes , I have an idea for the Best Victimless Prank Ever ! Plus it'll give a cashier a good story to tell . Dromiceiomimus , you've got to help me on this one .
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT
You can get WORDS tattooed on your KNUCKLES so when you makes FISTS people will see WORDS THAT ARE ABOUT TO PUNCH THEM .
LATER , REVIEWS OF T - REX'S BOOK SAY IT'S TERRIBLE :
No reason , just & # 8212 ; sharing !
" I don't know because the reproductive consequences of the sex act manifest only infrequently , and when they do it's a long time after the sex was performed ! Duhhhhh ! ! "
These are baby laws !

The only place that the energy and matter needed to produce body hair can come from is through food ! Bottom line : that's a VIABLE WEIGHT - LOSS VECTOR that I simply don't have .
HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT SHAKESPEARE
Dromiceiomimus , please . Of course I know what a calorie is !
WELL IT'S ONLY A SMALL CHANGE FROM THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW
ACTUALLY , you were describing a book with the exact same premise . You're plagiarizing yourself , dude !
I don't think that's fair !
FROM HISTORY
Ha ha , no , this isn't a riddle . It's a real question I'm investigating !
Relax ! I wasn't SUGGESTING that we do it ourselves .
OKAY WELL IF YOU WORE PANTS IT WOULD WORK REALLY WELL ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS
Just memorize that - phonetically , if necessary - and you'll be good . Observe !
Could anything be more fun ? ? THE ANSWER : no .
THANKS FOR READING !
You prefer hidden talent to palpable failure !
" It's hard being a Tiny Ghost , " said a frustrated Tiny Ghost in his adorable squeaky voice !
Well , if you want to marry a guy who looks forward to " [ making ] bad decisions all day long " , then yes !
that is nice to say
I want to make out like a bandit !
But that . . . thing you said , with rails ? It's a language for solutions but , um , what addressing issues are there ? Like , inheritance of boxes ?
It was exactly how medieval people supposed : the firmament is a solid mass surrounding the Earth , dotted with windows . Some open to let the sun and moon travel through , while others can be opened to allow gigantic warehouses of water , snow , and hail to discharge their contents . Stars are just lights on the surface .
He must have been talking to someone behind me .
You'd better do it soon , dude ! Clock's a - tickin' !
You don't like people who are different , huh ? How's that working out for you ?
IS it not true that a " cheerful nihilism " can carry the day , distinguished by an easy - going acceptance of meaninglessness ? There is no need for such physical and psychological destruction .
{ { thought bubble } } I must keep the other actors from discovering my secret to excellent tableau .
Hallowe'en is coming up ! Soon ! Soonish , anyway . Hallowe'en is coming up in several months . I'm probably going as a pretty pretty princess . Anyway .
This is going to be the best talent show ever !
Did you hear that ?
I don't know - I'm really not comfortable with such intent towards love ! It all seems so calculating and shrewd somehow .
" Here lies T - Rex / Where he's going , he won't need . . . roads . "
[ [ whispers ] ] happy birthday dromiceiomimus
Um , you're not supposed to speak during tableau , T - Rex !
Everyone needs to stop walking in on me while I'm having a shower , please !
And may I just say . . . " pooty poot " ?
Awesome in the " oh MAN do I love disaster movies where everybody dies " sort of way . You can pretty much imagine it yourself ! Within a few hours or days , the power goes off and a few nuclear power plants fail , which could be Problems . And then it's just decay ! Concrete cracks , buildings collapse , and nature reasserts itself . Streets and buildings become grassland and hills . Also , all canvas and paper decays and is eaten by tiny bugs .
Oh , my existential angst ! Is there no happiness without knowledge of purpose ?
Hmm . Wait , I'm not sure . Do they ?
That makes me feel worse ! !
Sadly , film isn't as advanced an art form as comics . We've covered all its possibilities already , and all shots are long , medium , or close ups .
BUT WHY DID YOU CHOOSE FEMALE
Man ! Forget discovering the true nature of reality !
Those sound like pretty suspicious circumstances , T - Rex !
Are you going to have a baby ? Is parenthood in your future ? Well I guess there's no better time than now to share with you my
Okay that's all I want from the future , well bye
Jennifer - Yes . Do you want a boyfriend who's only a little desperate ?
Thanks T - Rex ! ! You've saved our sucky marriage once again !
But you'll always have memories , both of past / currently present you and of the place !
Hello Dromiceiomimus ! Did you know that if you held your eyes open when you sneezed , the could pop out ? Pop !
He's unable , he's unable to see past her facade of bluffing !
Oh man ! Maybe - maybe EVERYONE on board was an observer !
But saying a word is just generating a sound wave , right ? I could record myself twice saying different things , and then superimpose their waves to get a new one ! Then all I'd need to do is train myself to produce THAT wave and it would sound like I'm saying two things at once ! I could even do it by rote . Then when people ask me to do things I could say " yes " and " no " at the same time , and then they'd probably dislike me a little .
ARGH
PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES :
No response to my email proposing paltimes has been received . I am therefore , and reluctantly , forced to employ escalation tactics . As of 0800 hours . . .
Genius !
They should call it the " Walk of Oh Look , My Night Didn't End At Ten Thirty " or maybe the " Walk of I Am In Full Possession Of My Sexual Identity " or maybe even the " Walk of Stop Assuming I Had Sex , Maybe We Talked And Then Had Ice Cream ; Ice Cream Is Awesome Too and Don't Lie , You Want Some Right Now .

Alright ! Time to start some INTERNET BUSINESSES .
We're using language to hunt in packs and are developing technology
In conclusion , Lady Gaga repeats her claim of her facade of bluffing being perfect no less than four times , so it must be true .

He became a catburglar , robbing people at night and erasing their memories of ever owning the thing he robbed as they slept . " Forgive and forget , " he'd say !
Aw crap ! The world is going to explode at midnight tonight !
Sherlock agrees with me that digression is interesting !
ALSO A THIRD FRIEND IS THERE
I think that you're omitting many dimensions of song . What about the way it's played , the lyrics ? These too can be varied almost indefinitely .
Consider the phrase " fruit flies like a banana " . Is it describing the taste of fruit flies , or rather flying fruit ? How can a computer hope to figure this out ?
Okay , shoot , I know I had something planned here . What word was I going to use ? S - . . . " Standard " ?
I've got my name picked out !
20 G , tops .
WOO HOO
Pretty ridiculous ! But then I recalled Socrates " The unexamined life is not worth living " and at that point my head pretty much exploded .

Looks like you dropped the ball , NLP researchers ! !
Well , it's only poltergeists that throw things !
And then he goes back in time to meet Edgar Allan Poe , who actually IS haunted by the supernatural and has a creepy raven in his study , next to the silken sad uncertain rustling of his purple curtains . After picking up Mary Shelley , they ALL go forward in time and meet Patricia Highsmith , who is surrounded by morally compromised antihero neighbours ! Then they all go on a train ride and have an adventure .
Okay , awesome ! I'll drop you a line later . Maybe we can see a movie !
And so this is your ultimate story for kids ?
I'm no longer a mere person , cats and kittens . I'm a PERSONAL BRAND . Say goodbye to boring old T - Rex . . .
Thanks for going on this amazing adventure !
He was wearing one of those umbrella hats , so - maybe ?
These are functions that are easy to compute but difficult to reverse - engineer - unless you have the secret 'trapdoor' information . For example , the product of two prime numbers ( p and q ) is not hard to figure out if you know their values ( it's just multiplication ! ) , but if all you have is the answer , n , guessing what p and q are can take a really long time .
BECAUSE IT'S SUDDENLY REAL EXCUSEY IN HERE

Too bad you're heterosexual , huh ?
I fail to see the benefit !
I like the minotaur : head of a bull , body of a dinosaur !
And Frank wrote in his diary , " All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit , and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me " ?
I've never had one like that .
Yep ! Then I found out that it's really hard to make an imaginary horse jump inside a computer ! !
DID THEY ? ?
If you wanna date someone , ask them out , don't do this stalkery , passive aggressive " hey , notice I'm around all the time now ? " thing . That's creepy ! That crap only ever works in romantic comedies , and our BEST SCIENTISTS don't even know why it works there .
T - Rex , you can't " play by your own rules " every day ! That's nothing more than a catchy way to describe nihilism !
The result was ersatz marches , imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo , and even torch signal flares , used to signal divine planes that never come !
When big - city lawyer James Helpings inherits his late father's family restaurant , James is forced to return home , fulling intending to close the business . but when he sees all the good he can do there , and how this small town reminds him of the really important things in life , James decides to stick around .

Aw , you're not interested ? You just want some quiet and peace ? You're not falling for this sinker , line , and hook ?
Not only did A . F . S . not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds , he supplied a proof that this is , in fact , the WORST of all possible worlds ! First he assumed that the worst possible world would be sustainable , since if it ended , nobody would be around to suffer . Prolonged suffering across millenia beats instant death !
I KNOW . IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA .
And if you are bitten by a zombie , you become a zombie , OBVIOUSLY . But what happens when that zombie is killed ? Zombies too have unfinished business - unfinished FLESH - EATING business - which means ZOMBIES BECOME GHOSTS TOO .
And at present , he was learning about pine trees !
Done !
Right ! Right . " It was a spooky house full of corpses , and ghosts too . "
Personal " I'ma eat my food with this " forks showed up around the 4th century in Byzantine Empire , which was very excited for people who liked clean hands . Then it took us literally FIVE HUNDRED YEARS for them to catch on in the Middle East , and another hundred or so until they arrived in Italy . In 11th century Italy , forks were a big forkin' deal !
Soon the " Bat - Man " was solving cases all over England !
aw damn i made one too
Okay ! I will use that feeling of pity and grief , but WHICH BIBLE CHARACTER SHOULD I HAVE BE RUTH AND / OR RUTHLESS ?
You know what freaks me out the most , though ? It's those remote control cyborg cockroaches they've made by pretty much taking over the animal's nervous system . I can just imagine the insect screaming endlessly in it's mind as its own body is made alien .
Oh , Morris !
I stayed at home last night and watched a movie !
Yeah , I . . . kinda left some of my schemes out . My best - laid ones , actually .
Did you know that Europe is , like , REALLY OLD ? ?

Sexual maturity HAS NOT been a walk in the park for ME , ladies ! !
You act as if the purpose of my life is to entertain others !

Ladies , please ! One at a time !
No problem : " Baby sale " . Or , for the shoes : " Debabyfied Minishoes " .
I thought you said this was a good story !
Food for thought !
Oh gross ! !
I don't have a bike !
LOOK AT ME I'M TALKING LIKE YOU
You believe you're totally fake !
It's a terrific place to read fiction !
Hey baby / that sex was fantastic / I hope next time / I'll be more enthusiastic ?
Sound like you're upset !
You raise some good points . However , you forget one crucial thing .
Oh man , I want in ! Let's make a documentary about our lives .
Shut up ! I'll kick your ass !
No wait , Batman riding a pterodactyl , and the pterodactyl has eyes that shoot lasers !
Onomatopoeia is when words sound like the thing they're describing !
Well , we have printed records of people praising their performances .
No , I mean - what if you're the ONLY PERSON who gets reincarnated ? Just you . You keep coming back at different times , and then the big reveal is that EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO EVER LIVED is you on some past or future runthrough ! You fall in love with other versions of yourself . Your greatest enemy is YOU .
This I do believe !
An amazing dilemma !
That would be a TINY bit inconvenient for me T - Rex ! I need you to write a joke for my speech tomorrow to the Chiropractor's Union .
SEE PEOPLE ALWAYS CLAIM THAT I AM BASICALLY THE WORST DUDE EVER BUT IF THAT WERE TRUE THEN YOU MUST ANSWER ME THIS
Walking past your childhood home at night and seeing a strange family lives there now and wondering how their lives are different than yours emoji .
It was SO embarrasing ! My fave crush was there and he saw everything ! Just when I thought things couldn't get worse , God showed up , and he kicked us both out of the Garden . . . for good ! I could have died !
Delicious !
Although on closer inspection I must concede that building a fully functional T - Rex robot , overnight , would have been pretty darned choice .
Right ! Like how I'm in a minority because I sometimese like to sleep in on weekends .
No . No , I said THROWN out .
LET'S GO EAT BURGERS RIGHT NOW INSTEAD

My friend , a dude with so many opinions should have his own website , just for them !

T - rex , did you remember my birthday today ?
I catch myself downloading food pictures when I'm supposed to be working
Now we are clear ! And yet , I still want to step on more tiny women ! !
But You're not supposed to ask . That makes you seem needy ! It causes my friendship crush to fade a bit !
In fact , that's it for a lot of debate , because how can you argue FACTS ? Most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands .
Because the last time I left a party early to go have sleepytimes for about eight hours , it occurred to be : ALCOHOL is doing this ! Why am I drinking it ? People drink to be interesting and to lose their inhibitions , but I'm ALREADY super interesting ! Plus , dudes , I'm pretty sure I've lost any inhibitions I may have had long ago ! !
No , DON'T !
If we were all immortal , then obviously we'd have a overpopulation problem . But what are some of the less obvious downsides ? What does a world where everyone is immortal ACTUALLY look like ?

I also made peace with the possibility that I might never have kids !
But as you can see even though she's dead , she's PRETTY FINE . Woah , I didn't even mean that in the " fine as in sexy " sense ! ! That's awesome !
Peterella !
And clearly nothing else ever stops the flappers either ! So there's themed flappers for each decade afterwards , even buttoned - down fifties flappers in cat's - meow housework dresses . And modern day flappers are like regular well - dressed ladies , only instead of saying " that's ridiculous ! " they say " aw , applesauce ! " ALL THE TIME .
Folks just want to tell increasingly awesome stories !
CAN'T reproduce and DON'T age : that's a ghost !
BORING .
Yes . There it is !
Are you a person who uses phrases at incorrect times ?
I can only hope the world is ready for it !
My friend Utahraptor is sassing this book I'm writing . He's really insulting ALL of us !
People hated parking tickets long before you came along . They ALSO dislike restrictive bank service hours , computer phone systems that make it difficult to talk to a real person , AND unjustified authority .
The Devil is claiming credit for GTA IV . He wants to undermine the entire gaming industry .
And if you STOLE one of those prehistory babies and brought it back to the future , you could raise it as your own without any problems and it would blend into modern society without any special issues !

Ok guys , get ready for my new SCIENCE FICTION EPIC that will blow your - -
Why can't you just be happy with the name you've got ?
Here it is !
I know , Dromiceiomimus , I was skeptical of myself too ! But teeth naturally accumulate plaque and decay . Dentists apply technology to biological life ( me ! ) to upgrade my smile and stop biological decline ! Isn't that what cyberneticists do ? ?
It's amazing ! Some people have jobs where ALL THEY DO is design special interfaces for android users ! !
Quite possibly ! ! You get a dog and name him . . .
I've discovered that the problem with researching this sort of thing ( polygamy ) ( the subject of which I am speaking ) is that everybody has an agenda !
Yes . I suspect that without fail , somebody always accidentally consumes the semen .
Hi , T - Rex ! Do you have any personal stories of your youth you'd like to confide in me ?
Be no afraid , for I am pure information given form , as perfect , raw and freebased truth . Gaze upon me and you gaze upon the face of fact .
Millions of years of evolution were all leading up to that one amazing moment of your birth ! Billions of individuals - entire SPECIES - had risen and fallen , all conspiring together to produce one thing : you !
Issues ! You're building a robotic punching machine that can punch a whole room of people at once ! What if the elderly were in the audience ? What if it was calibrated wrong and punched through a guy ?
I LITERALLY WROTE THE WORD " SADNESS " . What could be more evocative of sadness than THE WORD WHICH MEANS THAT EXACT THING ?
I don't see anything unusual , dude !
. . . and bring it to term with a surrogate mother who is herself married !
Well then , how are you going to answer . . . THIS !
'I Think I Might Be A Zombie Who's Fullitis " .

Listen though , don't tell my mom , okay ?
OKAY , some folks are tacky .
I thought we were deciding who would win the game , not who is the sexiest ? ?
Writing fiction certainly isn't hard . Not when you have tips !
But what if i could ?
Well , I've made up my own joke to get him today . All I need to do is " find that Utahraptor ! "

Something tired of land dwellers .
This means that winter is coming !
BEETHOVEN'S NINTH SYMPHONY :
Okay , but what about FLYING invisible giants ?
GUYS THAT MOTHER WAS SO EXTREME !
Poop's so gross , can we all just agree on that right now ?
I just had the funniest thought ! The thought was , wouldn't it be HILARIOUS if someone thought that I was coasting on past successes ? That would be funny because it's SO not me .
" Mistakes happen " is the effect , and I'm talking about stopping the cause . Just don't allow mistakes to happen in the first place , and OH SNAP , your homespun excusionary aphorisms will no longer apply !
I would !
But it was me . I was biking and a dog darted in front of me and I guess it turns out I'm not a guy who will run over a dog ! I'll run over a squirrel no problem but I swerve and slam on my brakes and go over the handlebars of my bike to avoid hitting a dog .
NOR does she ask " Mirror mirror mounted centrally , please provide a closed - system technique of reversing entropy " . What a jerk ! !
GARDENING : Uh , way more badass than I was led to believe ? ?
I like 'em .
I would be gone !
they're great
UTAHRAPTOR let me tell the story ! !
These inventions don't seem to actually better anyone , T - Rex , OR our society . They're just ? rubber bands ?
And let's say I don't want this cat to eat me ( the real reason anyone feeds a cat ? PERHAPS ? ? ) so I go to the store and what do I buy ?
And his name is - what , " Science Personified " ?
Alright , but you have to promise not to tell anyone !
I think so . Maybe ?
Aha , I know you're only trying to point out the limitations of my plan , but it's to be the perfect FRIEND , not the perfect PUSHOVER .
Oh man , I never told you ! One time , I saw a stupid guy nobody likes eating too many bananas ! !
Whatever , man !
So it's the June 21 , 1931 and Lieutenant Hubert G . Chevis is about to dine on a meal of Manchurian partridge with his wife !
Time to start practicing ! Say something to me .
Geez Utahraptor , I hope you find what you're looking for
MEANWHILE , IN THE PAST !
They're animal crackers for a new generation . Come on ! It's a great pun , PLUS , every time you go into my bakery you can choose your own gender roll ! It's brilliant !
Woo ! New bike day !
And that's how come I don't run around with my mouth open anymore , THE END .
So funny I literally laughed . gif !
Okay , dude , that's a great idea . Doc Space and Prof Time meet Secret Agent Money , who is loaded like whoah .
Why simulate an entire universe when you can just simulate one awesome dude ?

Aw man !
Sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them . Sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast . It depends on the scene , you know ?
Dude , our world is one where EVERYONE DISAGREES ON EVERYTHING . You're never going to build a government that makes liberals , conservatives , individualists , communists , and EVERYONE ELSE happy .

I can die if I don't get any food , but if I don't get any sex , then I just - keep on keepin' on ? Also if I'm hungry , I can't lock myself in a room and satisfy my hunger with my own food that's BASICALLY almost as good as the genuine item .
They're the ones with wings !
I went through a document of 100 million English words and counted each of them . You'll never guess what the most - often - used verb form in the English language is !
MY BROAD MUSICAL TASTES ENCOMPASS TUNES BOTH CHIP AND OTHERWISE
No , honey .
Nothing , huh ?
The whole idea of the cold / warm blooded binary is discredited . It turns out there's an entire spectrum of thermal management possibilities between these two misleadingly - named endpoints ! In any case , you're warm blooded .
Have you noticed how that's your solution to every problem ?
I knew I kept forgetting to destroy SOMETHING
Just expand the reasoning out to the things I buy , the way I talk and write - they all add up to a unique set of artifacts generated by ME .
I wonder , did growing up in a small town influence my values ?
NO THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS A JERKY THING TO DO

THE EXCRETION OF SACS NEAR BEAVER'S ANAL GLANDS ARE USED AS A CHEAP SUBSTITUTE FOR VANILLA TASTE AND CAN LEGALLY BE LISTED IN INGREDIENTS AS " NATURAL FLAVOUR "
Fine ! I'll go do that !

Answer ; yes . Over .
Argh ! I even hate the TERM " futurist " !
Pfft , LOVE . There are precisely zillions of stories about love . The world wants something new , not ANOTHER story about two chuckleheads who don't like each other but then later on , GUESS WHAT SURPRISE they totally do !
His bark is worse than his bite !
Offer them a seat at a table , sit down at the table with them , then FLIP THAT FRIGGING TABLE .

Mr . Tusks ! What if I'm clean out of funny jokes ?
I KNOW ! ! But dogs are all " geez my body isn't built to see this dang colour , geez , I bet I could smell it though " .
I thought to myself , " T - Rex , you'd better make a note of this ! "
I got that , yeah !

You're not a fan of " T - Rex died today after being really old for a while " ?
That's genetic ! Utahraptor ! That's the worst fake racism yet ! !
I know , right ? Who are you going to hang out with ? If you try to reach a single person who's far away , it means you can't visit people closer to you that maybe , cumulatively , you like more !
ANSWERED THE PHONE IN THE NUDE :
No thanks ! I don't see why I would bid on them whe I can see you naked , for free , right now .
. . . WHOEVER WANTS TO AS LONG AS THEY PAY ME MONEY ? ?
Well , UTAHRAPTOR , you're going to have to take THAT up with TV , print and radio commercials , who disagree !

T - Rex , I'm sorry . I'm sorry .
OKAY IT'S LITERALLY MADE FROM GROUND - UP MUMMIES .
So you see Captain Suggestible as a tragic figure ?
It has been a frustrating , moist day
I don't understand it ! I was not around any sick people . I did not eat any bad food . And yet , ouch , my stomach !
The way I see it , zombies are either avoidable or too effective . The only way to become a zombie is to be bitten by one , but not to get eaten , yes ? Then the bite kills you and you come back as a zombie . But zombies WANT to eat you ! It's only the sucky ones that bite you and don't finish the job . So if the first zombie was REALLY GOOD , the infection wouldn't spread , because he'd cold eat all his victims ! And if he was sucky you could just avoid him , on account of his suckiness .

IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ETHICAL TO COPY AND EMULATE THE GAME IN QUESTION
But I though -
5 ) sweat
I reject your question , Utahraptor ! It's loaded !
How had we gone from love to masturbation so quickly ? Had this question been asked before ?
ALL I HAVE LEFT TO ME NOW ARE FEELINGS OF RAGE AND SADNESS
It was some party ! !
SAYS ME GOD WAIT HOLD ON A SECOND SHAKESPEARE IS HERE AND HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ONE SEC I'LL PUT HIM ON
And let's say you're a lady or fellow who thinks " Man , heaven sounds like okay times ! I've GOT to get in on that action . " But you're stymied , because which religion should you choose ? There's like a billion different ones , and if you bet on the wrong horse then no heaven for you , chumpy !
LATER : " PROFESSION MEMBERS " IS REPLACED WITH " MEMBERS OF AN IDENTIFIABLE SOCIAL CLASS OR GROUP OF WHICH WE ARE NOT MEMBERS "
Come on ! Of course not .
Hey , do you wanna go ?
I mean , eat FEWER chickens . " Fewer " is when you can count them , and " less " is when it's more of a mass and less countable , right ? Like , I'd eat less rice , but I'd eat fewer COUNTABLY - MANY grains of rice .
But I don't know how to solve that problem ! I do have opinions about the broken credit card infrastructure , however .
I like to keep my sexual fantasies grounded in good science , thanks !
THEN they cordon off the tree of knowledge to prevent any future mistakes , finally burying it in cement Chernobyl - style !
And when that happens they call it a manuport : something that was carried by hand by ancient dead dudes . Manuports are neat because they show you what ancient dead dudes found interesting ! And the most awesome manuport is the oldest one , called the Makapansgat pebble . It dates to 3 million years ago !
Well if he can do anything , that'd necessarily include " Shakespeare impersonations " .
Utahraptor , I need a job ! !
" 256 Pictures Of Cool Bugs "
Folks say things like " Apples are a delicious gift from Mother Nature " , or talk about how we can use things in the way Mother Nature intended .
i thought maybe it could be me
Similarly , could I myself be the essential " masculine " ?
STUBBED TOES THAT HURT REALLY BAD
I guess we'd have to declare a truce , and then we're back where we started .
SO MY QUESTION TO THAT IS WHAT'S THE DEAL
A boat can float along for years without crew or sails or a working engine . But if everyone disappears on an airplane it's not like we'll find it still flying around years later !
Plus , buying the WHOLE DANG PLANET means buying everything on it , and that means we now have to put a price on LIFE ITSELF .
TO BE CONTINUED
Oh God . That's disgusting .
I'm open ! I'm open ! I'm open !
You're talking about 1890s hits ? " My Sturdy Mules Pull My Darling's Plow " and stuff ?
I JUST WANT TO TASTE YOU
How INTRIGUING !
Look .
I didn't type that ! The words just appeared ! So you need to move fast to date me now I think ! !
It's true ! Plus , you've got to be eternally vigilant with your own grammar , lest you mess up yourself .
Excuse me .
ONE TALK ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF REALITY LATER :
We start with the number of children born to billionaire parents each year !
Hooray for potential Christmas smooching , my friend !
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT AFTER YOU SATISFY YOUR BASE DESIRES YOU PLAN TO CONFESS YOUR SINS BEFORE GOD .
But reflecting on it later Pete realized that if this woman's death was so well - known at the bar then probably others knew it too , and it WOULD be a pretty good prank - especially if you just needed a ride to the cemetery . He came to respect the effort put into the sweet prank .
This whole thing is so implausible ! How did you suddenly become a counsellor ? Where do your customers come from ?
What the heck , T - Rex ? I invite you out a'swimmin , and you get a far - away look in your eyes and walk away ?
No man , he's nice ! He just weeps all the time .
YES I CAN .
THIS IS ALL THE BIKE HELMET I NEED
Why not just ask what the best " art " is ?
You're right ! I'm not certain if overusing 'awesome' is , in fact , awesome . I'll cut it out for a bit while I consider the issue !
Breadmatic , I'm worried ! The fact that you're a robot is already coming between me and my non - robot friends !
God is all - knowing and all - seeing , right ? So it follows - THROUGH LOGIC - that . . . that . . .
The house ? Why would a house be bothering me ?
My stars , I have been so busy lately . And it continues ! Up to Friday is going to be KRAZY for me .
Also , you shouldn't swear !
It hurts me sometimes !
It's not actually about building a time machine , though , even if you're teens . It's a collection of original short fiction where all the stories have this same dog that keeps showing up in the background ! That title tested better with teens is all .
Land of the free , home of the GRAVE ? Done !
WE HAVE A WINNER
TRENDING TOPICS IN 2014
EVEN SO , it's still going to be rad . And you know why , Dromiceiomimus ?
What ? What ?
You just need to ROCK MORE !
So check out this rad backstory I invented : the " United States " has a super - long copyright period because a hundred years ago , my original character " Walter Disney " created his OWN character , one " Michael 'Mickey' Mouse " , which -
Hey , T - Rex !
Hey , my game eventually came out ! FINALLY . Things are looking up !
UNDEFINED RESULT
That was all Timmy .
Actually , gluten is the name for the nutritional slurry used as a starter in industrial yeast cultures !
I am no longer worried about not having any friends if I move to a new town . I have turned a crisis into an opportunity ! An opportunity . . .
Yes . On account of how humans respirate !
. . . Okay WOW I kinda want to unfriend myself ? ?
So when I ask you this question I hope you'll answer it truthfully : you wanna hang out tonight ?
. . . I'm listening . . .
Dude . You could've just said " games " .
Perfect ; that sounds like a 100 % legit conversation !
Nope ! I know that the word " niggardly " means miserly , and that it has a completely different etymology from any words that it might happen to sound like !
See , T - Rex ? THIS is what a statue of you looks like .
ALSO , HANDSOME
But we need Olympics for non - physical competition too !
The SCIENCE fiction ! !
Street artists have moved indoors ?
So , my racist joke somehow backfired on me .
It is inarguably so !
Hi there , T - Rex ! What's nothing more than a convenience ?
Dromiceiomimus , I would like to reward you for being my friend ! What would yo like ?
I am going to try ! !
Fubs !
Yep .
YOU PULL BACK FROM TERROR AND STARE INTO ITS EYES , AS TERROR LOOKS DEEPLY INTO YOURS . YOUR TEARS STOP , REPLACED BY SOMETHING ELSE . IS IT - DESIRE ? COULD TERROR POSSIBLY FEEL THE SAME THING ? YOU LIPS TOUCH , TENTATIVELY . YOU -
Thank you , thank you .
What's the matter , T - Rex ? You seem preoccupied .
Utahraptor , the 80 - year - olds paid the bill perfectly !
You could have timed this yourself ! I guess this is kind of an unnecessary favor .
TINY BLACK HOLES COULD BURROW INTO YOUR BODIES , EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE OUT .
Uh , ME .
" I want a cell phone contract that lasts 18 years and which requires me to feed and clothe a pooping phone . It will bring me deep satisfaction to watch that phone get older and older and older "
" Oh yeah ? You had a cold in November . "
So I've got a 1 in a 50 million chance of being here !
Um . Boredom ?
So it turns out there's this " space treaty " that all these nations signed , saying none of them would ever claim ownership over moons or other planets . They've declared celestial bodies as common heritage for all sentient species !
Car Crime . . . uh , 4000 ? ?
We need to start talking about more interesting things ! Screw that : we need to start DOING more interesting things . Imagine a world where the most popular word is " explosiontastic " , because the most popular things ARE explosiontastic ! Now , think of a reason why you wouldn't want to live in that world .
I can do more , you know . I've been practicing ! Here are my thoughts , dear Utahraptor , on what your spirit looks like . From one beautiful soul to another , you know ?
But not until the 1400s , so if you're in the 1200s and nobody understands you , you could always wander around , find another dialect group , and try again !
It is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE .
It can be really hard to quit , dude !
I dunno . . . I liked it !
Guys , I could die tomorrow ! But that's not the worst of it !
" Tame what you keep , but please , keep what you tame . "
You know what's super important ? FEELINGS . Especially other people's feelings which are not boring at all . Yes , that is most definitely a face . We should all be concerned about them .
Except that dentist's office is ALSO closed forever , T - Rex ! ! The dentist told me through sobs he lost all his customers because you never floss .
Heck , Dromiceiomimus , you can ride them anywhere ! IT IS THE MAGIC OF ROCKOONS .
Mine started off promising enough , but derailed in the third act .
My boy , my boy , my boy .
No man ! We're not going to be terrible people who are friends with a guy just because he has a pool . We'll be awesome sexy WELL - ADJUSTED people who are friends with a guy because he's totes sweet , and the pool will be a bonus ! It's " gravy " on " the side " .
T - REX IS TELLING THE TRUTH :
Perhaps ! But I've decided to solve this problem ONCE AND FOR ALL by arranging my own funeral , plot and gravestone myself . Tada !
Everyone who loves parking tickets , throw your hands up in the air ! Raise the friggin' roof !
Shiny time T - Rex drive
I mean , and don't take this the wrong way , but I thought your erotica was pretty terrible ! But I'm realizing I was approaching it expecting , you know , naughty tales , but your audience must have found something else they liked there !
No , it's our minds too ! !
This sucks !
But have you considered that no song stays popular forever ? There's bound to be a backlash , and the faster a song becomes popular , the greater the backlash to it once it begins to fall from favour !
Man , I don't know about this !
Folks could say " Oh , that ? That costs a T - Rex . " or " Here's your change : two T - Rexes . I love those coins . They're so handsome . "
But it's true ! I have trouble remembering the names of friends and tell jokes when I should be empathetic and understanding . I'm just trying to cheer them up , but usually they want sympathy instead of rough chuckles !
Do the people there have cars ?
Another fun experiment is to wrap copper wire around an iron nail !
Um . . . it's called - " How to Be " ?
Did you at least like my comparison of life to a three - legged race ?
He really was ! !
How's the play going so far , T - Rex ?
BUT IT'S CALLED THE " WIDOWMAKER " , T - REX .
You KNEW that would expose any bacteria on them to microwave radiation ! And you KNEW that all radiation , regardless of source , causes gigantism and monsterism !
Our first question comes from a very handsome man . Oh my Gosh it's me ! !
FANTASY IS IN NOW
So , Dromiceiomimus : Do you know how to draw superheroes ? I've got such a great idea for a comic .
He just can't see anything that was lost beyond an afternoon's worth of memories . Anyway , soon CompuSteve is meeting old friends and great - great - grandparents and integrating into a society of immortal people whose minds are no longer constrained by the processing capacity of meat but by the speed of light itself .
A man died , T - Rex ! That's not funny !
Dude , there's no rule that says you can't play two games at once !
You lost the baby you were supposed to take care of ?
ON ACCOUNT OF HOW YOU ARE CURRENTLY TAPPING YOUR FACE
THAT ONE DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
It's shameful !
Come on ! If you're including spam as text , are you including webcams as film ? What about security camera footage , stored and erased without ever being watched ? And how are we defining worst ? Personal taste ? Objective value ? Box office performance , ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION OF BOTH MONEY , POPULATION , AND BOX OFFICES ?
You have scored zero out of a possible 142 points ! Thank you for playing Star Trek trivia !
FACTS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE ABOUT MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIASTS COMICS
My self - worth isn't tied to how much other people like me : that's what I tell myself ! You don't have to be popular ALL of the times . If I'm alone for a few days , it's fine ! It's cool ! I'm still totes awesome ! !
THAT THERE CAN BE NONE SUCKIER
But - there's no particular flavour of Irish evil , T - Rex ! It's absurd !
Don't talk to me about societal norms ! We walk around naked !
None !
THREE YEARS AGO
NO . The first person who ever said " Like us on Facebook " is likely STILL ALIVE .
Wait , this can still be salvaged ! Utahraptor , you know what I dislike ? PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO TAKE A LONG TIME AT THE CASH , FOR VARIOUS REASONS ! !
But the galaxy is so big that each orbit takes 250 million years . So every second that passes , we're orbiting to a new part of space hundreds of kilometers away , where NO OTHER LIVING THING ON THE PLANET has ever been !
Great sage , I have travelled long to hear tell an answer to my question : does she love me ? She loves me . . . Yeah yeah yeah ? Okay cool , perfect ] ]
I don't now if I want to freestyle with those lyrics , T - Rex ! Also , I graduated years ago .
Upon closer inspection , forget THAT noise !
Yeah , but you shouldn't just have chicken for dinner , T - Rex . You need BALANCE in your diet . Nutrition , man ! You know about nutrition .
You what , T - Rex ?
A disconnect with life , a sense of emotional and physiological flatness which may be a symptom or a cause of the disorder . It's very rare , but one that I imagine is quite upsetting for everyone involved . Sometimes the person affected won't eat .
What are you gonna eat : carrots ? You will be so sick of them . Avocado ? Pfft , nice try , but guacamole does get old after a while . Give it some thought and you'll realize the obvious choice here : the potato .
Eh ! Too crazy .
Welcome to panel 6 ! The good news is you're not a Dracula . But the bad news is WHAT THE FRIG , I THINK THERE'S SOME DRACULAS HIDING OUT IN PANEL 5 ! ! ! AHHHHH , WE CAN NEVER GO BACK
Utahraptor ! ! It's " too much poo " !
AW FRIG
The most delicious fad of all time .
Shit ! I hadn't thought of that !
It's true ! Basically , the engines had two weighted balls , attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine . As the engine speed increased , these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force ! At top speed , they would be parallel to the ground , nearly touching the " walls " of the shaft !
It's very nice , thank you , T - Rex !
Might I suggest " Pilgrim's progress . . . Into The Terrible Depths Of Space " , " Gulliver's Travels . . . Into The Terrible Depths Of Space " , or " Alice's Adventures In Wonderspace " ? And if space doesn't float your boat , then at least punch things up a notch ! " Things Explode Apart " , The Gale In The Willows " , and " Lord of the Lord of the Rings / Flies " would outsell their less - awesome counterparts by at least a million to one .
Now , I myself am a tremendo - meatatarian , which means that I only eat meat that I find to be tremendously delicious !
BUT OKAY YEAH KLINGONS
HAH HAH , JUST KIDDING !
WARNING : THE PRECEDING EROTICA WAS EXTREMELY SEXUALLY CHARGED
Aha , so much for the golden rule ! There's a lot of other awesome variants anyway .
You see , the thing is . . .
Let's - let's say it's both .
This is because I'm violating the understood limits of our friendship !
NOBODY SAY LOVE !
So I flipped him off . It was BICYCLE ROAD RAGE !
All you're doing is talking about punch ! Why not just go get some ?
LATER , IN COURT !
T - REX I HAVE SENT YOU BACK IN TIME NINE YEARS TO EXPLAIN THE FUTURE TO YOUR FRIENDS
First off , Dromiceiomimus , notice how I'm approaching you within three seconds of making eye contact . So sexy , right ? Now I'm playfully insulting you , STUPID , which shows I'm not intimidated and makes you want to impress me , perhaps through . . . SEXUAL INTIMACY ? ?
I gave you some eggs and you said you'd make me muffins !
" Holy smokes ! "
" Tell me about the case , " T - Rex said !
But you know how wishes are , Dromiceiomimus - they always end up with IRONIC and UNEXPECTEDLY NEGATIVE consequences . It's the nature of the beast ! We'd probably end up mindless but technically " happy " .
Now , YEARS LATER , when we're all sitting around and reminiscing about the first prank calls we ever got , I'M gonna be the one who gets all quiet and sad . Frig .
Depressing !
ba - boom
45 MINUTES LATER
All gone !
And why do we pay him to bring stuff to us in the first place ?
Whatever ; I had too many friends already anyway
The very next day :

Sure would ! Hmm , I wonder if statistical measures of association would correlate well with human judgement of construction acceptability ?

EASY WAYS TO REMEMBER THE SCALE OF NUMBERS
HOW WRONG WAS HE
" Vitamin C " is now slang for cookies , and I have good news !
ALTHOUGH , I'd rather if we didn't . There's a lot of issues and politics around disabilities ( can deafness be something to be proud of ? What do you make of strangers who volunteer to push you in your wheelchair ? ) , and I'd rather not get involved in the debate via my being " super tall " .

Absolutely .

God gave himself Wolverine claws . But I can't imagine what possible use they'd have for a divine being !
But in that time I looked at related videos and things that interest me , and MAN , I realized I probably caused more information to come into the world by doing that than by writing : what videos I watched what I searched for - the works ! All this is information I caused to be created !

We can put a man in the sky in a heavier - than - air aeroplane , but that aeroplane can't pull up high enough to reach the moon ? ?
UTAHRAPTOR ! What are you doing here ?
TOTALLY WORTH IT
I SAID IT
I think racism is BAD . It's like when you say you're fundraising for cancer - you're not in favour of it ! You want to cure it . That's what I meant !
So ! With that out of the way - are you coming to the party tonight ?
That certainly is a problem easily solved !
why not ?
It's new and exciting !
He says - there's some merit to both sides of the issue ?
THE STORY OF RUMPEL - STILTSKIN
Because if you accept that the world is a finite plane , then it's got limits , and what's at the edge of those limits ?
It's so amazing : " ma " , " pa " are some of the first and easiest language - like sounds babbling babies make - and what's the word for " mother " in English ? " Mama " ! And it's also " mama " in Dutch , and in Romanian , and in Catalan , Slovak , Quechu , Romanian , Chinese , German , Russian , and MORE . The languages have evolved such that the first language noise a baby makes sounds like it's saying " Hey mom , what's up ? "
And " queu " ?
Meeting a woman is about getting to know her , and what better way to " meet " a woman than to know her very thoughts ? ? yes , the easiest way to truly meet women is to pick up a book and learn all about her , including what her motivations and plot points are . What are you waiting for ? Millions of single women are waiting to meet you tonight ! !
What happens to ME when I die ? Me . Myself !
Crap ! I should have an emergency kit ready !
Good point !
" Yes , please do ! " said Good Sherlock , as he leapt out of the shadows !
I think it's beautiful and amazing that millions of years later , another human being dug up the same pebble , recognized the same face , and maybe even for a moment , dreamed the same dreams .
I want my money back .
Do you really want to hurt Me ? Do you really want to make me Cry ?
I listened to a bit of it : one album was quite the " corker " !

Wow ! ! I want to pay you all the money .
Ah . I thought maybe you'd wade into the gun control debate with something a little more substantial than " Need something punctured ? Have you tried . . . A GUN ? "

What's the secret word ?
AT THE RECEPTION :
. . . Sexual tension ?
Oh God ! Imagine if I'm using Facebook a decade from now ?
Besides , it's not like I stop whatever else I'm doing while I think up sex stuff - heck , I could be thinking of crazy sex stuff right now ! In fact , that sounds real nice ! !
But there are conseq -
Like what , T - Rex ?
Man ! What is the DEAL with triflin' friends indeed ?
Well in that case you should cut out this conversation , because it's largely irrelevant .
" It's the latest in fashions for thunder - lizards , " said the thunder - lizard . " It fits my crown perfectly ! "
Yeah it'd be crazier if you died in real life for real , but that version of the game is rarely played .
Maybe I could put a lemon inside .
I haven't forgotten ! I was just , um , going to thank everyone else on the planet first ?
T - Rex , you -
You'll have a lot of updating to do , T - Rex ! Dead horses get beaten while gift horses get looked in the mouth , which , INCIDENTALLY , is also where reliable information comes straight from !
Today we're going to make a vegetarian food !
Hey , who put the penguin in the tiger pit ? !
I know tons about my favourite fictional characters . I can talk about them at length !
So we keep the friends we already have , and that gives us an advantage in this run .
Hey T - Rex , do you have any more potato chips ?
ONE WORD :
I made a list of people I know from reality versus people I know from fiction . DUDE , CHECK IT : I know more members of Starfleet - an organization that does not exist filled exclusively with people that themselves do not exist - than I know ACTUAL FRIENDS .
Jump to the moon !
they're SO WRONG that I think they're physically hurting me
Ants can easily be defeated by stepping on them .

Although that would mean we'd all get immortal talking puppies ; listen , I need to get back to you on this one
That's seriously me right now !
Without breaking a few LEGS .
Nobody's eyes are a chartreusey shade of puce .
I don't get it . Hot air comes out of the heating vents but the place still stays cold . Have I a leaky , drafty house ? If so , WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE NOW ?
I wish I knew .
Aren't they just asteroid impacts , T - Rex ?
WHAT ? They store a phrase in my sparkling mind and now they're abandoning it ? I call FRIGGIN' SHENANIGANS on that !
I have thought of the snappiest comeback ever ! All I have to do is trick that Utahraptor into telling me what he'd like to make a living doing , if he had a choice . Then I can say :
FIFTY YEARS AGO :
Wait . Wait . You yelled " stop the wedding " at some random wedding . . . just to prove it was a bad idea ? ?
Self , what is the deal with mammalian breasts ?
Exactly ! We hedge our bet by having friends !
One day Joe went in the kitchen and produced a sandwich so sloppy that we had to call it a " Sloppy Joe " !
But what did Newton know , huh ? ? Are we really gonna follow LAWS laid down by THE MAN ?
Mrs Fitzherny ? !
People who deserve thanks for that ?
I know I know but still !
Well then , here are some friggin' tips ! !
I'm gonna make my own universal constant joke now , and I'm gonna need you to tell people about it .
That was an extremely funny joke , Utahraptor ! You should be laughing right now . EVERYONE SHOULD BE LAUGHING , RIGHT NOW .
Ok NOW I'm a statue .
AWWW YESS
Hasn't failed me yet !
But WHAT IF he recognized that and let those people be free ?
Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present !
Well , aren't you saying we can't judge historical figures in a modern context , because they lived their lives during different times ? But then what's the point of having our advanced modern ideals , if we can't apply them ? I think we SHOULD be able to judge historical figures !
SIX YEARS , EIGHT DAYS AGO TODAY :
I'm not entirely certain that you do !
This is most often seen when people play games of chance . They'll assume that , say , since they've had such bad luck with rolls of the dice recently , they are somehow " due " for a good roll !
STOMP ! STOMP ! STOMP !
and we should make the most of our time on this world - Richard Dawkins
Perhaps ! But that is a topic for ANOTHER TIME
Yes , really ? Someone's name could be FARTNOISE FARTNOISE JUNIOR , and that someone could've been ME .

And so it's like - you need to care for your car to make it grow up into a truck and then an SUV and if you're lucky a monster truck . Maybe a plane . Weird cars grow up into boats .
First off , you need to read the book ! I know , reading is like watching a movie with the explosions turned off , but just power through !
But then the boss hates him so much that he LITERALLY kicks him out and then slaps the sign back up ?
BREAKFAST SHAKES :

In another reality , you could've had a PhD in penis fencing .
Okay , it's just - there was a wallet in my toilet this morning , and you left last night in a hurry , saying you'd " Need to visit the wallet store soon " but then came back once and clarified that you were pretending you were a friend of yours when you said that .
And with that , I exhaust all my knowledge of Henrietta and HeLa cells . I am well and truly tapped .
Fine ! FINE . I'll take everyone back in time with me . WHY NOT . HOW HARD WOULD IT BE TO TAKE EVERYONE BACK IN TIME .
My detective doesn't show all the clues to the reader ! He's always detecting stuff that the reader doesn't know and can't know , and at the end when he figures out the mastery , he arrests the murderer for reasons that we aren't privy to and that no careful reading of the text will ever reveal .
In effect , WE ( and by 'we' I mean 'dinosaurs' ) have become the all - powerful Gods of old !
And then , just as fast , I was back here again . . . back in my own universe !
Ahem . My wit is CHRISTMAS THEMED
AW DANG , GOD ! WHY YOU GOTTA DO A THING ?
Well , language generally reflects usage , so REALLY you should be asking historical generations why they thought being an adult unmarried woman was SO TERRIBLE .
I think she's got a point , T - Rex !
How can you trust a medical science that won't share the amazing secret of LIE SERUM , also known as the " Serum of Lies " and more obliquely as the " Serum of Inducing Distrustfulness In Others " ?
GAME SET AND MATCH BABY
So go to the hospital and have them removed !
I gotta . . . skate ?
I can't get enough ! All you have to do for comedic gold is have someone say " Boy , I sure hope < x > doesn't happen to me ! "
Um , it's way more fun to print out comics than to deal with interpersonal issues ?
" Bicurious " !
First disease : fatal familial insomnia !
Yeah , but you're not writing them down , so it sounds normal . Pretty normal , anyway . It sounds a little like you're speaking with a weird accent .
How's that ? You've been to the moon like two times yourself !
I knew you were going to say that !
I've discovered something exciting
Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich ?
Figures !
Pixel art ! I guess .
P . S . : FABLES ARE TERRIBLE
I think the smell comes out his nose
Yep ! AND , he was given the title of " Sexiest man alive " by People Magazine TWICE .

HOW TO BUILD A YOU
And the other ?
The only problem is , I don't know any millionaires ! Where do you go to meet millionaires ? Is there like , a pool I could hang out in ? A pool where I can float over and say " Hey , you look nice , maybe we should be friends ? "
The Perseid meteor shower usually happens in August !
You , tiny woman , are too tiny and also lack personality !
That was like - a grim , dystopian vision !
T - REX YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT SPLINTER TAUGHT THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES TO BE NINJA TEAMS
Another shot at immortality , T - Rex ?
Spring is one of only TWO KNOWN SEASONS that starts with the letter " s " !
That actually sounds awesome , yo ! I might go do that RIGHT NOW .
. . . I really look forward to seeing him !
SEE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I TRIED TO TELL MY FRIEND UTAHRAPTOR
Check it out : Jesus gets crucified , then three days later his heretofore unknown identical twin shows up and takes his place ! Oh snap ! TWIST ! !
OH MAN ! !
But what does this have to do with MY modern work - a - day world ? ?
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SOMEONE HAS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THIS :
So THAT'S how Steinbeck did it ! !
BROS : ALL THESE THINGS CAN KILL ME , BROS .
Once upon a time there was a brilliant scientist named Mary ! Guys , Mary had her own problems .
Utahraptor .
Oh , what blessed relief .
THEN , you just look for the place of maximum overlap and follow the precepts there ! Say you discover most religions say something like " Give to the poor " : you know that by doing this , you're maximizing your Heaven Potential & # 8482 ; for HUNDREDS of religions at once ! Plus , you're not wasting time on CRAZY and UNPOPULAR precepts .
I submit that it would be pretty okay indeed !
That means he HAS to answer questions or he gets fired ! !
I'm in over my head , Dromiceiomimus ! I've totally barely ever immigrated !
{ { now i'm not saying she's a gold digger / because i don't know who we're talking about / come on let me know i promise i won't tell anyone } }
I mean , yeah , I would've assum - -
YES ! Yes , Utahrpator , pretend we're dating and I'll break up with you over the phone .
Well obviously !
Try doing something new to break up the routine !
Edge cases that happen so regularly there's 142 murders PER DAY worldwide ? ?
Dear audio diary : today I made another problem that can only be fixed by time machines ! ! AGAIN . It's like - my special skill ?
Alright , you go then , Utahraptor !
BUT LIKE ,
If they're not using capital letters , I'll stop using them too , because I don't want to seem all hoity - toity ! And if they're using smilies then I might throw a few in , just so they don't feel like I look down on them . It's like - I'm somehow so insecure about how I type that I become this chatting chameleon . You know , Dromiceiomimus ?
Impossible ! I'm certain that THIS song will be so good that , for the rest of time , folks will forever say ,
And " aging " affects everyone ! The greatest of them " age " just as quickly as even the suckiest of dudes . No , wait ! BETTER IDEA ! SOMETIMES , a sucky dude will live a super long time and a truly great dude's body will poot out early on . So it's really unfair and unpredictable !
Or maybe updates will be installed without even telling us , so when things break it'll be a big surprise each time with no friggin' discernable cause !
" The Day After The Earth Stops Spinning And Everybody Flies Into A Wall " !
Also the scientists get way ripped from all the science they're doing and that can be PRETTY DISTRACTING , y'all .
And Also If There Were Robot Men Who Would Be Our Friends ( TM ) !
Featuring me !
T - REX I SAID " FILL IN FOR A TEN YEAR OLD SQUIRREL "
There's a princess ?
So uh , it turns out that the flouride in toothpaste is , um , TOXIC . POISONOUS . There's enough flouride in a tube of toothpaste to END LIVES . Dentists weren't joking about not swallowing toothpaste !
MEANWHILEM IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE GRAVITY REVERSED RIGHT . . . NOW :
Dude , calm down ! You can handle this : it's just a dog ! Some people have CHILDREN , and they're way more dependent than pets are .
Adorable ! ! And night - marish if it ever actually happens !
That's one for the ol' resume , eh Dromiceiomimus ? " Independently invented Buddhism . " Put that down next to " Received props from a bear " , " High - fived a bear " , and " Has a driver's license that suggests my middle name is 'Commander Punchy' . "
Tonight is Hallowe'en , and that means . . .
Cause here I go !
Check this out ! " Dromiceiomimus , that was a lovely meal . "
It's comedy ?
At the top is SELF ACTUALIZATION , which sounds pretty great , right ? Except you can't get there unless you've already satisfied the level beneath it , which is esteem . And you don't get esteem - both self and from others - without relationships , and you don't worry about friggin' relationships until your basic safety needs are met . And finally , you don't worry about basic safety if you need to poop !
It's back !
Similarly -
Dude ! I'm busy !
This I accept !
- because stories like this make me worry I'm living my life wrong
That - that'd be a reasonable example , actually . STILL THOUGH .
This is not the person I thought I was !
Out of the blue ? Wow . Gutsy move , man .
Hello , Dromiceiomimus ! Or should I say . . . EMILY ? ?
I have constructed a rocket - ship for myself and a guest of my choosing ! The wood from this house will provide the fuel !
Man , forget you guys ! I'm done playing this game . I'VE got things to do today !
555 YEARS AGO :
You don't even particularly like horses !
So this guy is at a bar and he's a heterosexual and he's trying to pick up women !
Who here thinks technology that existed in the past but has now been forgotten is totally awesome ?
The efficiency at which clues were discovered after dangling a criminal over the edge of Big Ben helped Sherlock deduce things faster than ever !
EPILOGUE :
My phone internet is down ? FFFFF -
what happened to it ?
" The scar had not pained Harry for 19 years . All was well . OR WAS IT ? ? " - I love it ! Can you write the new sequels for me ?
Nightmares aren't really that great , T - Rex . Bad things happen to people you like .
. . . SO FAR .
What ? Are you talking about your $ 50 debt to Utahraptor ?
TALKING ABOUT LOVE : NOT THE SAME AS ACTUALLY BEING IN LOVE
And this coloured your emotions in the morning , and whatever you thought of seemed to be a little worse because of it ? I've had that too !
It's Earth Day ! !
T - REX LET'S MAKE A DEAL
You're the guy lounging in his boat . I'm the guy on shore , strapping boats into a colossal trebuchet and firing them into the sky . Oh snap ! There one goes now . You idly glance up , a hand trailing in the water . Can you see it ?
THEY PRESENT A FORMIDABLE FORCE TO ANY OPPONENT
And what did he do ?
T - REX HOW COME YOU WALK AROUND THE DOWNTOWN CORE NAKED
That's because , some days , I take an envelope out of hte box and I PUSH IT .
Yeah , but the mailman doesn't know that ! Credit agencies and consumer profilers don't know that . People impatiently suffling through my mail don't know that .
Mars ! Let's go there . I really REALLY think we should go to Mars , you guys .
THEY RAISE SOME DEEP QUESTIONS
B - Because God told me to ?
COMICS IN WHICH T - REX HAS DEVELOPED SUPER HEALING POWERS , WHICH ALLOW HIM TO RECOVER FROM ANY INJURY ALMOST INSTANTLY
Wow , EVERYONE thinks it's cool to say " pooty poot " !
Ah . Well , the forecast does actually call for sunny with cloudy periods .
Yes ! Popular things . . . a . k . a THE BEST THINGS ? ? Why listen to ALL music when you can just grab the " Greatest Hits of [ WHATEVER , PICK A DECADE ] " album and save some friggin' time ? ?
RAGS TO RICHES : someone poor gets some money . Imagine if it was you ? ?
Dude , calm down !
Specially - drugged Agents have retained glimpses of the true nature of His gifts , but at the cost of shattering their sanity beyond any recovery . WHAT PRESENTS DOES HE BRING US ? ?
The report I read said the slippers alone were real : a gift from the fairy godmother !
Nobody even noticed how I made my examples of the awkward moment kiss gender neutral !
Hello ? ! The Macbeth article is like 10 pagedowns long ! !
This is when the author puts himself in his story ! It happens whenever Hamlet is heard to remark " Forsooth ! ! That Shakespeare chap is excellent ! "
Why yes , I am super - sexy today !
What if it's moving at relativistic speed , T - Rex ?
Are you going to argue that imagining alternate realities gives us motivation to improve this one ?
1920s : Whoopee is synthesized in a lab for the first time ever ! But sadly , it's too late for the last Toot Toot Tootsie , which goes extinct . 1930s : a downside to staring at smoke is discovered .
THAT PHRASE HAS BEEN DONE TOO
It sounds gross but I totally think he would've done it ! !
I have been quietly seeking out part - time employment , and my search has finally come to an end !
Hey , have you ever gotten emails from people who do that with EMOTICONS ?
Britannic was Titanic's sister ship ! After Titanic sank , they upgraded her to make her MORE SINKPROOF . But before she could begin transatlantic service , the Great War broke out and she was converted into a GIANT FLOATING HOSPITAL .
Why should we bother assigning an identity to what is essentially one frame of a constantly - changing motion picture .
. . . Oh my god , MOOD IS AMAZING ? ?
You would actually prefer to stay at home and renew old friendships
I have always wanted to be a doctor ; they are so honourable in my mind and do so much for people in need .
If you say " begs the question " to mean " raises the question " you are a lesser person . Objectively so .
Okay , yeah , upon reflection my idea of manliness ALSO involves being way too tough for hygiene .
This - is actually a really fun idea !
But why did he say it to his dog ? Was it because all his friends were flakes ?
But what if there's no food , and you're hellishly starving for an eternity ?
No thanks ! Besides , there's nobody else here . . . how would you show me one ? Were you just going to make out with yourself ?
Hey , you're still here ?
Once upon a time there was an Emperor who was big into fashion . He met two tailors who promised o make him a suit made of the finest fabric : one visible to ONLY the most intelligent people !
GUYS THERE IS A THIRD OPTION
It would actually be pretty neat , I think ! You could see your changing responses and everything .
Life is great !
I'm not sure what I'm asking here
ALL THE REST
LISTEN I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO BE SEXIST
[ [ thought bubble ] ] SEND TO : all hotties / REGIONS : all / FLAGS : important , must - read , NOT A JOKE
I feel like the " baby " to " matey " sea chanty conversion is more compelling !
Having a baby ? Afraid you might " saddle " your child with a terrible name ? Well GOOD NEWS , because it's time for -
The best part of my mystery story was obviously the chase scene . Therefore , I've written a new story -
One day when you are older you will wish you had set your sights a little higher .
T - REX DECIDES TO SOLVE ALL HIS PROBLEMS BY FOUNDING HIS OWN UTOPIAN COMMUNITY :
Oh wait , sorry , YOU WOULDN'T KNOW .
Then she controlled plants to make trees over the Arctic .
A regular person in regular clothes can handle about 5 G before they pass out . Not bad , regular person ! !
I'll pass .
THE BITEY GUY THAT YOU LIKED FROM BEFORE IS BACK ONLY THIS TIME HE HAS A SEXY LESBIAN FRIEND
But you can hardly taste it , eh ?
I'm not sure how that happened
And then the sorcerer steals the lamp , right ?
Do they fire them like arrows ?
COMICS IN WHICH DISASTER STRIKES !
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN ALL THE THINGS THAT ONLY I SEEM TO REMEMBER HAPPENING ? ?
I'm thinking , maybe I have no business writing romantical - like stories ?
" TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART "
But then I'll just outbid her with the exact same motivation !
What's causing the rad explosions ?
Is that a fad ?
But on second thought , screw the north pole !
maybe . . .
HE DOESN'T CALL BECAUSE IT'S LONG DISTANCE AND HE HAS CRIPPLING DEBT
What about reality shows , interviews , documentaries arguably . . . ?
Man , I got Sugarhill Gang's seminal hip hop jam " Rapper's Delight " stuck in my head !
WEEKS LATER :
DOES IT NOT REALIZE IT BELONGS TO ME
" In this sequel Romeo is a vacuum cleaner and Juliet is another vacuum cleaner , wait this is just an ad for vacuum cleaners , whaaaat ? "
No , my name is " Skellington " .
Some " cool cat " sucka tryin' take you for a fool / sellin' you on polyamory . / That's where instead of one sweetie / You get a whole bunch of partners , like two or three !
Holy crap , we're now at HITHERTO - UNCHARTED levels of moronic !
And I wanna eat it at home and sometimes I wanna go out and eat it in public and I DON'T CARE IF ANYONE SEES ME . In fact , if I know the person watching me , I usually invite them to join in !
I need to find myself a Valentine , STAT !
Yes ; I'm glad we could all hear it instead of just reading about it later in some lesser medium .
Sex for clean dishes ! Exactly !
YES HE IS . HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU AND HE WANT TO KISS YOU .
EXACTLY ! ! Pets get to eat one thing and be done with it ! They don't worry about NUTRITION because it's all taken care of in that one food !
Honestly , smartness aside , this just sounds like a movie . Everyone's hot in movies , but not every movie is hot .
And whould faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method ?
I don't know - sunny , with a chance of clouds ?
So we know the definition , but what's the word ?
We're out of our league !
Tons of different utopian societies have been tried before , and all have failed ! Including YOURS , T - Rex .
Can we make that card ?
Alright , I was talking about my virginity !
Only if you're not participating in today's theme ! !
Yes . I , um -
How is that not everyons's ULTIMATE FANTASY
. . . Batman's an obvious choice .
YES , I'm doing this . I am going to do something meant for RACISTS .
LISTEN , I DON'T THINK THE METAPHOR IS SUPPOSED TO INVOLVE COMPUTERS . I THINK IT INVOLVES , LIKE , DOGS ?
Yes ! Of course ! ! THAT'S A SUPER OBVIOUS UPSIDE !
HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU & # 8230 ; R TASTE IN MUSIC
What about monounsaturated fats versus polyunsaturated fats ? And why is cholesterol still a thing ?
This month might be the best month !
It's winter again in less than nine months , Dromiceiomimus ! And you know what that means !
What's cooler than a robotic T - Rex ?
Light verb constructions ( LVCs ) are constructions like " take a stroll " and " give a smile " !
And bodies are gross
POLYSYNDETON
You're putting a lot of blame on civilization ! Maybe the problem is ourselves ?
Recently I have discovered something that disturbs me ! My savings account is now less negligible than before , and yet - I kinda want some money ?
Oh man I love those glances ! Those glances are so great !
And then we fall asleep and do it all over again in dreamland ! !
A sassy cat ! FROM SPACE . A sassy cat from space who has an eye patch with a skull and crossbones on it and who has swapped out his feet for bolted - on rocket boots !
I don't have a goatee ! That Utahraptor has moved to . . . Good God ! He's in my universe !
These aren't very practical tips , T - Rex !
Okay , fine , enjoy your hair - dressing . You just stepped on one of your customers .
That's not a logical fallacy .
What about the scene where they both have the same action figure ?
Perhaps ! There are many twists and turns and revelations in my exciting non - canon tale , Dromiceiomimus !
Women LOVE patrons !
FUNNY 1 :
Not hardly ! You can't deal with the " issue " of socialism by just summing it up in a few sentences !
Put the Millennium Falcon near Federation Headquarters . . .
Seriously , what are you talking about ?
And YOU'RE blocking a much smaller number of particles from hitting the planet , so it'll move a little towards you !
So you REALLY chose paper and he chose rock and then you had sexy times ?
T - Rex , your house is on fire !
. . . if you call that " living ! "
MAILBAG TIME WITH GOD
Okay , so what shape is the universe then ? ? If your answer is " I dunno , an ice cream cone or something " then stop reading . You have lost this adventure ! Your score is minus ten . If your answer is " I dunoo , how about SADDLE SHAPED ? ? " the you already know about this stuff , so stop reading . Your score is three points .
I am tripping several balls right now , T - Rex ! !
MEET SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T SUCK THEN TRY KISSING THEM
Please avoid such crass language , Utahraptor !
Man , YOU'RE already up too ?
MUST BE NICE
Who am I ?
" Collectible " is the worst word because it simply means " having the ability to be collect " ( i . e . , EVERY SINGLE OBJECT THAT THERE " S MORE THEAN ONE OF ) , and the word is loved by companies who use it because they're too chicken to admit they manufacture itams which exist simply to be owned .
I've said my goodbyes !
I can't believe it , I'm the source of my own problems ? But I so enjoy blaming society for my shortcomings !
The Incr - - The Fant - The Sweet Dudes !
Wow , everyone should've just listened to me in the past because I still totally agree with what I was saying !
- what . What ? Where the heck did Saturday do ? What -
Whenever I think of the phrase " good to the last drop " I think of the friggin' Maxwell House Coffee .
My friend , I'm afraid you've gone insane ! You're coo - coo crazy !
Oh ! And she saves every file to her desktop , and they're not even snapped to a grid , they're in a big pile that she rifles through with her mouse whenever she wants to find something .
My friends , children are our future , and our future CAN be great . But that greatness needs the next generation to continue posting their WIP angst crossover fics under their real names , just as we did . We need this !
You should've been Jacques Piccard or Don Walsh !
The number of hamburgers in my body is probably around 3 . That's a 'thr' followed by two 'e's !
AND FINALLY , YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM MIGHT NOT START RUNNING IN " FULL REVERSE "
Delicious food is delicious , no matter how good or bad it is for me ! Wouldn't it be so much better if how good a food tasted to me depended on how good the food was FOR me ? Chocolate would taste worse the more I gorge on it , until I stopped out of disgust . And if I haven't had any vitamin A in a while , carrots would taste like friggin' MANNA .
What ? No , he doesn't know how to use it . I told you , the plot is exactly as it was before . This awesome stuff is all in the background !
Or is ever likely to be done !
Everyone gets bruised and goes home hungry !
I know ! So , to proceed , some of my favorite sex things are the following erotic circumstances AND / OR manoeuvres . . .
How was the club , T - Rex ?
BOTTLED INSPIRATION COMICS
Dude , you REALLY want to tell a new story ? Tell it in a new LANGUAGE . One developed specifically for that one narrative , every semantic and syntactic choice supporting its characters and theme . A beautiful single - use crystal , useless in all other endeavours but still sublimely perfect for its one and only true purpose .
to the hip hip hop and you don't stop
I'm a chick ! Hah hah hah !
T - Rex . I'm a nautical engineer .
Alright everyone ! Let's do our friggin' TAXES again , okay ?
Aw man , really ?
So ? !
LATER : THE TATTOO PARLOUR
Hey , I've been going to the gym ! I've got some big ones on my arms !
What is up with newlyweds stomping on an empty wine glass after the ceremony ? I mean , if you're out of wine . . .
Nice . Also , " Ate thousands of pounds of tasty things ( NICE ) but expelled thousands of pounds of poops ( GROSS ) "
And I realized : if I do have this giant fan , it'll be way more fun to use it OFFENSIVELY than it'd be to simulate skating indoors . So anyway , I bought the fan , installed it on my house and now I blow enemies off my lawn .
Later she DIDN'T decide to prevent a bunch of butterflies from flapping their wings , and the world is scoured clean by hurricanes . THE END .
Which charity would you donate to ? Is it perhaps a charity dedicated towards RESUSCITATING YOUR DESICCATED CORPSE ?
And let's further go on to say that , oh , I don't know , the crime I pulled off was really minor like parking in a spot without paying a machine enough to park ther for that long ? ?
With my killing ray , I . . .
By following the nutritional regime of the Nutrinomicon , you can be assured of a fine diet !
But if you can make the characters look even better , you get past that !
How did this make you feel ?
Another case closed !
Oh , and I forgot to mention the best part ! She also lost some of her some of her MAMMALIAN WEAKNESSES , like giving birth to live young . Eggs with protobabies inside come out of her now ! !
And your bro is like " woah bro " .
They're what every man desires but cannot express !
If everyone knows people are being insincere , then what's the point of polliteness ? We end up in the same place , semantically speaking .
Don't knock it 'til you've tried it !
SHIT !
IT WAS SO TERRIBLE
I'm saying weird homophones !
A horse walks into a bar and the bartender says " why the long face ? "
There's stall all the time zones ! I'm calling her TONIGHT . I 100 % guarantee it ! !
Hello , recipient of this card ! I am your friend , so this is me pulling you aside and whispering into your ear .
die .
You guys aren't racist . Actually , except for the skin thing there's not really ANY differences , and come to think of it , I don't think I even mentioned my skin colour either .
Okay , but is it bad to FIRST be friends because of the name , but then later become REAL friends ?
The greatest proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not being visited by tourists from the future . I call this Sexy T - Rex's Argument Against Time Travel !
Okay , let me put it pragmatically : the time you spent helping your friend is a sunk cost , but you've received a strengthened friendship for it , and if your friend hears you complaining that benefit will be undone .
That's not pathetic fallacy ! It's when you give emotions to inanimate objects : " ice wants to float , " and so on . It can also happen when when weather mirrors a character's emotions , like when Shakespeare gets sad , and it starts to rain . I think that's what you meant ?
Yeah it just seems , I don't know . . . a little racist .
A SCENE FROM THE UNIVERSE WHERE HATS DIDN'T GET INVENTED UNTIL NOW
I guess I've been pretty lucky to get this far without making any big , life - altering mistakes . I think the biggest mistake I ever made was mixing up some juice from concentrate that had a ladybug in it !
Wow , that's super hot .
NOPE !
I know ! ME TOO .
Yeah but so's sight , and I can ALSO use sight to check out women , and dictionaries .
Poussez - le bon !
A JOURNEY TO THE MOON
Oh my god . It's the job you were born to do .
Yessssss
A PUPPET STATE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS T - REX
I am currently single , but I'm certain it's not because of my opinions
Such as ?
It's a small enough issue that I can understand it fully , AND it's a problem I can solve at night with my fists . I can't solve global warming at night with my fists , Utahraptor .
Sorry I said " suckers " , grandma .
Ah , so your first instinct when sick is to claim a desire to evolve beyond the need for mortal bodies , rather than taking even a small step toward treatment .
No thank you , T - Rex ! I don't buy my compliments .
This sounds kinda sexy ?
One day Peta Parka was bitten by a radioactive mite and gained mite - like powers .
OH SO YOU DON ; T BELIEVE GAMES SHOULD STRIVE FOR INNOVATION
" Hey , Utahraptor's , um , great ! He's tall I guess and his skin is orange and also brown I think . On his belly or whatever ? "
THAT MONDAY :
Time to check up on that utopian society I founded ! I bet everything is totally perfect there in Utopia Land .
Hey , have you seen Dromiceiomimus today ? I hear she's got a secret ! A secret one might even classify as . . . " super " ?
Plus the Earth orbits the sun at 107 , 000 km an hour , so we're stuck in time a little bit more .
I propose a journey to the moon !
then it seems you agree
I'm pretty sure I like my friends because of the people they are , but what if I'm just kidding myself ? What if I really just like them because they're an economic cushion - someone to bail me out , even literally , if I get into trouble ?
but as a character in a comic , I am required to be a source of entertainment . This is a demand that I have up to now been unaware of . Thus I must provide the reader with some semblance of comedic banter . . . perhaps a pun using the phrase " breaking the fourth wall " and my current action of crushing many walls .
I freely admit that I do not !
Cell phones built into your friggin' hands !
Is it a metaphor ?
Whoo !
And THAT'S how we choose to fight . We choose vampirism . We choose to dedicate our now - immortal lives to rediscovering the ancient science of ghost - on - ghost bustin' . And when we're finally ready , we make our last choice : to step out into the dawn , and begin our ultimate , greatest battle : Dinosaur Vampires vs . Zombie Ghosts .
No go : you expect it to make you feel good , so you sould be doing it out of SECRET GREED . What if you and I are the last people left , and I give you a real nice cookie WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY cutting off my own head with giant scissors ? That's kindness without good things coming to me , therefore there's no self - interest !
Good Lord !
And variety is important too : well - dressed folks are helped by the casual dress standard .
Man , you should be talking to Dromiceiomimus !
You can ALSO be remarkable by , holy shit , memorably cussin' !
Anyway I fixed reality ! Feelings have slogans now !
There !
Hey T - Rex , why are you putting in all these long hours ?
That's - well , that's not a bad idea !
But , Utahraptor . . . perhaps NOT !
What about you , T - Rex ? What did you do for YOUR mother ?
So now , whenever you're home reading a book or whatever , will you think " Man ! I could be at a SEX PARTY tight now ! " ?
Um , you're not allowed to lend out that software like that , T - Rex !
INSPIRATION FOR DUDES
I know , whenever I think about it I feel sick ! I'm like this :
You finally came up with your personal creation myth , huh ?
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD HOW'D THEY KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING i'VE HAD THAT TAPE FOR TEN YEARS OH MY GOD
It's weird isn't it ? If you even just THINK about sex for five minutes a day , that's over a full day each year LOST . Man ! Think of all the things we could do with an extra day each year ! !
HEY . HEY .
I had a horrible dream last night ! Real nightmare !
I see . That's cool , I GUESS . I GUESS You can do what you want with you life .
See ? I'm wielding a truth bayonet over here !
Thank you . THE MAN WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE , ladies and gentlemen .
The royal " we " is used by monarches , popes , and also by dinosaurs named T - Rex . THAT IS ME , BY THE WAY .
VAMPIRES CAN HAVE KIDS T - REX
Shakespeare , how about you call your play " Space Quest ] | [ " ?
Well surely there's exceptions if it is not just everything , but " everything " .
AMAZING . I'll tell you a secret , Dromiceiomimus : that's the colour I see whenever I close my eyes !
It takes over our minds , our bodies ! How do you fight something like that ?
Today's literature :
Maybe it's one sided ! Maybe you don't even know who the sender is ! Maybe he's this guy and HE thinks you have this history and YOU don't know him from Bob !
DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS : HOW IS TODAY SPECIAL FOR YOU ?
ABOUT
What ? It's not excellent , T - Rex ! It's bad argument technique !
So Slappy Pete thought !
u kiss me and i think of turnips .
" BUT WAIT , " YOU SAY , " WHAT IF SOMEONE SHOULD COME ACROSS US IN THIS IDYLLIC GLEN ? " TERROR REPLIES LUSTILY , " LET THEM ; I WANT YOU NOW AND I DON'T CARE . "
All I need is a female business partner , Dromiceiomimus !
WALKING HOME , T - REX HAS AN EVEN BETTER IDEA :
T - REX COME ON
Hmm ? right now I could be bettering myself and the world we all share .
Not if you purchase and then read my new book , " The Dude Without Any Problems ! How To Become That Dude By Reading This Book ; Also Dude Is Being Used In The Gender - Neutral Sense , So Hello Women , You Too May Buy This Book Please " .
That's a pretty sinister name !
Know what I hate ? Comics that break the " fourth wall ! "
Okay - why vanilla extract ?
I will clean it up REALLY well . I will mop the floors ! I will mop the walls or whatever . I will tear the house down and REBUILD it , metaphorically speaking . I'm illustrating this metaphor by literally stomping on this house !
That sounds like a real nice way to go , actually
Listen , man : I don't know . God told me I would be filling in for a ten year old girl today , so here I am .
MILLIONS OF YEARS LATER :
today's technique :
OK !
That's because he is !
So , T - Rex , let's talk about sports !
Time to visit all my wacky friends !
CHAIN CHOMP ISN'T A POKEMON
" Also , Utahraptor's there : he's good too ! "
Obviously the original Matt Jeffries Constitution - class starship is the most iconic , and the template from which all of Starfleet follows . And if we're talking firepower , then sure we can point to the Enterprise E , but the ship's overly - busy externals almost wholly lack the grace and art - deco stylings of its predecessor , the Galaxy - class Enterprise D .
FACEBOOK STEVE . Please , if I hear any more information about Facebook I will die .
What does a Salvation Army Santa and a webcartoonist have in common ?
You know what they say : you can't take it with you ! You can't always get what you want ! You can't teach an old dog new tricks ! But you probably DON'T know this little factoid :
Yes , I think I'm going to dedicate a fair chunk of time towards exploring Mount Angry . I think I will plant my flag right at the top !
Utahraptor must never know I HAVE NO REGRETS
SUSPICIOUS , yes ?
A + + + + + + WOULD CONSIDER MY OWN SELF - WORTH AGAIN ! !
Okay , then all you've really done is assign each of your friends a score and then used that to label some of them " losers " , which is KINDA AWFUL . We don't form friendships with someone to feel better than them ! We're friends with a person because , in some way , they complement us .
He tries to tell her to run , but he can't !
Sometimes I think it's crazy that we haven't colonized other planets yet ! Other days I think maybe , JUST MAYBE , the rest of the universe will get by just fine even if we don't bring our murdery ways to it .
But soccer players have people in their lives who say " your fit , beautiful body looks great in this " , while baseball players APPARENTLY only have mullet salesman who whisper DAMNED , DIRTY LIES in their ears while they sleep .
Um . I don't know how to solve this problem .
OKAY FINE the cards are written by ME after I become a polytheist who intimately knows every single religion ! ! GAME SET AND MATCH , baby .
It was entirely great !
In 1922 in southern Saskatchewan lived a young woman , Helen , known as the Eastend Enchantress .
Wish for an end to suffering !
Notice the 'k' !
Why not change our skin cells to be replaced faster , so we'll constantly lose weight by leaving gross dust cloud of dead skin flakes everywhere we go ? WHY NOT ALLOW OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE IN " FULL REVERSE " , EXTRACTING NUTRIENTS FROM OUR OWN BODIES SO THAT WE IGHT VOMIT UP PERFECTLY GOOD CHEESE - BURGERS ?
Baseball isn't played because it's INTERESTING . Baseball is played because without darkness we would not appreciate the light : without sorrow , we would not appreciate joy . Baseball makes us savour life and reminds us to treasure every second we have on this beautiful planet , because such moments may never come again .
A stranger entreats you to answer how many black lesbian transsexuals it takes to screw in a lightbulb , and you can't think of a way to answer that question without sounding like a COMPLETELY TERRIBLE PERSON .
Okay , what if I had a son . . . WHO WAS ALSO A DOG ?
It is believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601 . The play is set in the Kingdom of Denmark , see citation 1 !
" Possibly " ! !
Maybe you should find out what she's upset about ?
" Ziiiing . "
( actually the Utahraptor ) [ [ arrow pointing at Utahraptor disguised as T - Rex ] ]
Both at the same time , Dromiceiomimus !
I'm a totally cool rock star !
But isn't colour a quale : a private , ineffable , subjective experience that can never truly be shared ? Do dogs have qualia ? ?
It just , like - water ?
Weren't you listening ? This will only lead to conflict !
YES . And I'll tell you why . . .
He doles out to the world a small amount of an INFINITE SUPPLY of biofeul daily .
Nope ! Nobody knows about Superman .
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD AND KIND OF GROSS :
DANCING LADIES AND TASTY SNACKS SUDDENLY APPEAR JUST OFFSCREEN :
That's three ideas in total !
YOU ARE WRONG
I do think " nuts " can be applied to chocolate bars though .
I guess they really did go . . . Back To The Future II !
We're going for MOST TRUTH across all of space time ?
That's true .
If you prick them , do they not adjust the regulation of their internal state ? If you wrong them , shall they not consider revenge , if indeed they possess the ability to perform that act and consider speculative futures ?
Should be awkward !
Maybe explos - ions will happen ?
I love her
Um , refer to it as " Sugar Crisp " till the day I die ? ?
IT'S AWFUL .
Physical diseases are like that too , T - Rex !
Yes ! Remember ? " . . . values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated " ?
Serves one ( 1 ) person who you are fine if they don't come over any more !
I'm just the reporter here . If people walked around saying " LADY UP " to mean " TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS ALREADY " then I would be talking about that !
In this joke , I speculate a more spooky version .
It's a very tricky question , and one that many people feel strongly about !
A fictional country ! ! Um , it's a little thing called " world - building " ?
Hold on , I can do this ! Okay .
The flood covered the planet : JUST LIKE IN THE BIBLE ? ? Or as it shall now be known , JUST LIKE IN THAT SHARED UNIVERSE FANFICTION SEQUEL TO MY RAD FAIRY STORY ? ?
Father's genitals .
I guess - still push him ? But feel worse about it ?
Now you're perfectly still , perhaps thinking I can't see things unless they're moving , T - Rex ? That's your name : T - Rex . We all took time to learn it , because we like you .
Man , I'm getting fed up with fighting these ninjas all the time . . .
I concede that , sometimes , it's nice to be polite ! However !
But then , where would I be getting my energy from ?
Man ! LET'S GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME . I dail the CORRECT number , call you , and try to break up , okay ?
Oh boy ! It's me , T - Rex !
Is that . . . the entire book ?
CANADA FACTS : Canada is a nation that some people believe is better at certain things than other nations are . Albert Einstein said nationalism is like measles : a disease only children get .
OH WOW
AT T - REX'S HOUSE :
Hey T - Rex ! I've also got an emotional problem that needs solving .
THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION :
Four words left ! Four words to sum up the world and everyone in it !
The two dinosaurs are talking about the weather .
That's probably why nobody's done it before .
Is this . . . the greatest legal loophole of all time ? ?
This means that there is no such thing as truth ! Your idea of what is right could be just as good as mine !
What the heck's your problem , T - Rex ?
Someone's attacking us from . . . space ?
So your Frankenstein's monster is a woman .
Everything I have is mine , and mine alone !
I - you're dating her ?
We can put a man on the moon , but Shreddies SERIOUSLY still have to taste like they're Shreddies ? ?
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN COMICS ( note that if you already have a full grasp on such differences , this comic will probably be of no help to you )
Why are you so excited about this , T - Rex ? It's just a box kept at the bank .
Hah hah , you jerks don't even know if the Higgs boson is real or not !
VALENTINE'S DAY
Capital ! Capital !
Yes . In Hindsight , this was a bad idea .
Brother , wanna thank your mother for a butt like that !
My nerdy interest in computer science has enabled me to EMULATE being a regular person ! !
You know what's better than school ? Not being in school but still learning !
Have you ever found yourself in a relationship that required at least a few sentences to explain what was going on , that couldn't be summed up in a single word like " boyfriend " or " ex - girlfriend " ?
There are no active De Lorean dealerships .
What'd Kelsey ever do to you , T - Rex ?
Three big problems . . . for one very sleepy dude !
Uh . . . T - Rex ?
I WAS GOING TO BE ON TIME FOR WORK BUT THEN I FORGOT HOW THIS IS A PRIORITY
It does , indeed , old friend !
I guess I shouldn't freak out too much about people smoking . I'm not sure if it's my place . . . I'll try to be more " cool " about it !
I think I'll go visit some places overseas . Why not ? I could plan a trip to the island nation of Australia !
But you're not writing , you're speaking !
Only that if you want the food to be less watery , let it simmer longer - for up to 30 minutes !
I think , somehow , we ALL knew that would be my epitaph .
Besides , if we live for the same amount of time then I'LL get to live in a world where you no longer exist !
Behind it is a standard Jeopardy lectern . He's been a secret contestant , all these years .
It broke free from both the ice AND the need for a crew ! And though people kept finding and trying to salvage her over the next 38 YEARS , she kept escaping . She may still be out there !
And the balloons are filled with pure joy !
Ruined .
FRIGGIN'

But this time . . . THEY BROUGHT A FRIEND .
I believe that when we die , our bones will be transformed over geologic time into rocks , and that these " fossilized " bones will one day be discovered , reconstructed , and displayed !
So . . . zero ?
Teh vast majority of stage performance is gone forever ! So much talent wasted !
Once spring is over , you may say " spring has sprung " or " spring has sprang " , but you CANNOT say " spring really frigged me on this one " .
I choke ! It goes down the wrong tube or whatever . It's very embarrassing and sometimes I require medical attention .
So what's 2 + 2 decimal , answering in base pi ?
Assuming you wear socks , anyway .
Yes , really ! Normally you're supposed to research actual history before writing an alternate one !
One was enough ! !
NO PROBLEM ! We're tight with some scientists , right ? Heck , we're tight with PROFESSOR SCIENCE . if anyone can nominate us for a Nobel prize , it's him !
MORAL :
Today I made peace with the possibility that -
I'm sorry , T - Rex , I really don't follow .
" Maybe we should get . . . milkshakes ? "
Hey , T - Rex , looking good ! Have you lost weight ?
REALLY ?
Did you just swear ? !
Let's consider !
" A biography full of surprises , not the least of which is how poorly T - Rex's erotic imagination fared on the world stage . " - The New Yorker
SHORTLY :
Yeah man : poopin ! Love it . Do it all the time .
Which are donkey ears if you're not rude !
NICE ! !
Sounds pretty plausible .
Ooh ! What a scary costume !
I am just not that thoughtful a person !
I , CAPTAIN ROBERT SCOTT , am going to die ? !
No ! You're stealing my idea !
I'm not saying there is !
All of this will go in Dromiceiomimus's back yark , which I forgot to ask permission about !
THE EXPERIENCE IS UNPARALLELED
THE MONA LISA :
I know ! ! Whoever writes movies has clearly never been in a relationship before !
I was unaware that I was T - Rex !
Now granted , it's not the cutest phrase if you just look at it . But if you think about what a happy machine would do - what it would look like , you end up with something that is just so cute !
Let's mug him anyway !
Wait ! Stop !
What are you reciting , T - Rex ?
In the 60s the CIA was experimenting with cats . They were making spy cats !
Cover your eyes !
I want to be a witch
See what you taste .
Okay , people have had my awesome idea before . BUT !
You will ? !
Okay , who here wants to watch me prepare a sandwich , and then have that sandwich shared with them ?
Yep ! I made drinks and set up lawn chairs and even a croquet set !
Then it's decided ! I will be a Utahraptor for Hallowe'en .
I'm serious ; please throw in a love story ; I'm terrible at writing characters with what I'm told are " genuine emotions "
I'm not even 30 years old !
And menacing .
May I be your guest ?
LET'S EAT FOOD ON A BEACH WITH FRIENDS
In Polish the stories start with " Long , long time ago " and end with " . . . and I was there too , and I drank mead and wine " ! SO MUCH BETTER . More author insertion in the last sentences of every story please ! Pr we could at least do something like in Greek , where they end with " . . . and they lived well , and WE lived better ! "
Oh my GOSH I need to open a pizza place called " Pizza Resistance " ! !
Ummmm I just want you to know that your last two questions have TRULY BLOWN MY MIND ? ?
Let's see ! Hours of unpaid labour , heavy lifting , getting to see all your laundry . . .
UH , NOT ANYMORE
YES BUT
There is ? ! What is it ? !
Anyway , there's all this AMAZING POTENTIAL in those ancient people , left untapped because they hadn't figured out how to be smarter yet . Dude , there's at lease 50 , 000 years between our having the ability to invent writing and us actually inventing it .
No ! Maybe ! I don't know !
Prefacing random sentences with selected semantically - empty interest phrases ?
This country is great ! It's far AND wide .
TWENTY YEARS LATER . . .
See , I thought it was too , but then I thought , maybe it's not ?
What was that awful music ? Did you just eat a foley engineer ?
Phew !
Check it ! Eating food in bed is like & # 8212 ; a crappy duck ?
Are there also vegetables induced to remind one of the taste of cooked chicken body parts ?
These seem to be getting more and more depressing .
WRITING TIP : TRY PRETENDING YOU'RE THE MOON
His first story was about an equally - sexy jet plane who made up HER own fairy tales !
Guys , it's not hard to stay fully unknowable even to yourself . There's an easy way to go through life and still have mysteries . All you have to do is . . .
You already did !
" THERE / now I'm not naked anymore " ? ?
Kinda have to count that as a win !
So what are you going to do ?
Okay . Okay . I'm done now .
Just one question . If that's true . . .
T - REX HOW COME YOUR IDEA OF ULTIMATE MANLINESS INVOLVES HIGH FIVING THREE WOMEN AT ONCE
Don't make me choose !
Okay , dismissed ! And may God have mercy on us all !
I should be safe - for a while ?
Oh yeah ? What are you dressing up as ?
That's absurd , T - Rex !
That's not a bad point . Okay ! I look forward to seeing what you come up with !
OMG I'm totally going to do that ! !
Is it true that the content of our thoughts - their very meaning - is determined , at least in part , by our environment ?
DOGS : WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ?
WHILE MOST OF US HAVE AN INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF STAIRS THIS SURFACE SIMPLICITY MASKS A WEALTH OF COMPLICATED AND INTERESTING STAIR FACTS
I thought we might give some advice to help these people .
BIRTH :
Yep , it certainly is the weekend ! Today is a day for MAXING and / or RELAXING .
I have for you today the SEXIEST DINOSAUR COMICS STORY OF ALL TIME ! It is sexy !
- Excuse me for a moment .
Aw geez , aw geez ! !
Oh . Well . That makes more sense .
What ? No , I never said that ! It's not true ! !
And what if they got the analysis wrong ?
Jenn writes , " Dead Professor Science , is it true that the moon is making each day on Earth longer ? IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE ? ? ? " Wow , Jenn , you got really intense there at the end . You went a bit crazy with the caps lock and then added the punctuation three times . What's going on ? What's up ?
I may be a bit idle , a bit unfocused , but at least I haven't had a night where all sense left my life ! That's for darn sure ! Incidentally , criminals are a superstitious , cowardly lot !
Wait - that's it !
I'm not sure that counts as leitwortstil , does it ? If it's just someone saying " Gee golly jeepers ! " , and there's no theme or motif associated with it - then it's just there for laughs , isn't it ?
Possibly ?
HOW TO CHAT UP THE HOTTIE BABES
NO THAT'S TOTALLY SWEET AND I CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO
Whoah , this isn't a coincidence ! This is PROOF of both a consistent timeline AND that I pulled off my plan ! I AM TOTALLY THAT HISTORY DUDE ! !
" Woah ! I need to go prepare myself for detective adventure " shouts Watson .
Man ! Time for me to grow some friggin' FACIAL HAIR .
T - REX FOR MISQUOTING VANILLA ICE I'M TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR WISHES
All I really want is someone to hold me and tell me I'm beautiful . But it's so hard for me to meet new people !
I didn't read the book !
I'm in !
RIGHT ON
No man ! I'm using " dudes " in the gender - neutral sense ! Y'all be dudes !
If you're not the centre of the Universe , then you're perched on an Earth that's whipping through space , and sure , there's problems from that . But if you ARE the centre of the Universe , then everything's revolving around you ! You can go through time without worry , because you'll always arrive right where you started .
Copper is an excellent metal because it resists corrosion AND oxidation , and the patina it develops protects it against further decay ! It's also excellent because you can build statues out of it . Statues , perhaps , of . . . T - Rex : . . .
It's true ! My friend , have we become elitist snobs ? Are we too good for anything ?
And in the book , I tell people that the key to being is to do things at times .
Those are song lyrics , T - Rex .
Attention everyone ! I have some terrible news !
Bwaha !
- that one works on pretty much everybody .
I WOULD TOO , darn it .
You fire your dehumanizer ray on every alien you see ! The explosions are so great . They're awesome . Each one is better than the last . Oh my goodness . Suddenly , you realize relationships are based on trust !
emotion by t - rex
That makes me sound pretty messed up , but yeah ! I guess !
t - rex don't you have other things to do
Yeah , but are we talking crazy insane or crazy sexual ?
Everyone ! What are your five interests ? Mine are fancy chocolates , smooth jazz , fly fishing , food that looks like other food , and beluga caviar !
a super excellent purchase !
I've come up with some patently absurd ideas that I will pontificate upon , only to annoy the Utahraptor !
WHY DO MY FREE - STYLES ALL END UP SUPER GAY
WE MOVED TOO BECAUSE
Pokazi mi kade boli !
Yikes !
Sometimes I do ! I wonder what it'd be like .
I am not all guys !
I checked the first 9 million digits and e = mc ? isn't there ! However , " LOL " shows up 2 , 482 , 128 digits in . As the first to discover this amazing fact , let these be my words on the matter , recorded here FOR ALL TIME :
Probably ?
Daaamn !
UTILITARIANISM COMICS
T - Rex , if our road trip is a secret - and if it is it's news to me - then why are you announcing it ? You're walking around in a sandwich board that says " I've got a SECRET , you guys ! " , and on the back it says " SERIOUSLY ! ! Hold on , I'll tell you about it . "
I have discovered the secret of being totally famous ! I will now share this secret .
Well we've only emailed up until now , but he seems really nice . I'm just heading out to meet him for dinner now .
Well , without knowing what these feelings are , um - I suppose you could figure out their root cause , and then deal with that issue ?
Not to mention " I wish I'd exercised less and eaten fewer vegetables , since it turns out I died anyway , wtf "

MOM , I was asking the OTHER pedestrians
Let us talk about sex , baby / Let us talk about you and me / Let us talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be / Let us talk about sex
You've probably spent some time as solid with a bunch of liquids inside you while continually expelling gas . Heck , we've ALL done it . But do you ever wonder if there's . . . BETTER states of matter to spend your time as ?
" They're not sure what they can do . They've heard that in the land of the blind the one - eyed man is king , but neither really wants to be a king , and that's mainly because they're both characters i use in sex stories mostly . Antonio whispers 'This is one problem we can't solve by having sex with each other ! ' , but it's too late because they're having sex with each other now . They eventually agree : it's as erotic as possible under the circumstances . "
OVERGROWTH :
IT'S JUST AS I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED !
PROBLEM : SOLVED .
" Sorry ! ! Wrong number ! "
Yes ! But we recognize that one dies so that others may live .
So why are both these " explorations of the soul " found in horror stories ?
Let's go with . . . NOSTALGRETZ .
Wait , no . " Newman . "
Who said anything about not having sex ? The whole point is you can do both at the same time !
How do you tell ? How do you know if today is the day to be Captain Achievement or if it's the day to be Captain Maybe Someone Has Sent Me A New Email , Still No Huh , serving proudly under Commodore I've Finally Been Able To Convince Myself That Minesweeper Is Actually Fun , Wow Suddenly I Feel So Much Closer To Death ?

TIME TRAVEL ADVICE COMICS
I'LL ONLY STOP WHEN A SCALED UP WORLD REPLACES THIS ONE SO THAT THE VERY TALL CAN WALK AROUND WITHOUT FRIGGIN HEAD CALLOUSES EARNED BY CONSTANTLY BONKING OUR HEADS ON THINGS AVERAGE SIZED PEOPLE WITH AVERAGE SIZED HANDS BUILT FOR THEIR TINY AVERAGE SIZED LIVES .
How hard can it be to chew and swallow 12 desiccated dry and salty crackers in under a minute ?
Suppose I write parody lyrics to a song , in my case hilariously changing " I Can't Get No Satisfaction " to " I Can't Get No . . . CELL RECEPTION " . This works REALLY WELL because my parody lyrics rhyme with the original ! It's much more satisfying for a listener than " I Can't Get No . . . More Than 2 Bars On This Crap - Ass Phone " , yes ?
I'm writing a story !
Whoah , now I'm interested ! !
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ! I appreciate you giving me the chance to address you . This whole thing started . . .
Sixteen times ?
At the instant you were born , you were the absolute pinnacle of our planet's development !
Utahraptor ! Are you turning my story into M / M fanfic ? ?
No idea , T - Rex ! It's not my mail !
Um , thanks , I guess !
Not really ! Philosophical zombies never even eat the flesh of the living !
They would literally go to a room and look at a painting and be all " Whoah , so fun ! ! "
Today is a good day I think for thanking my friends for their friendship !
IN WHICH A POINT IS EFFECTIVELY PROVEN BY ANALOGY
I'm not by a computer !
T - REX YOUR CAMPAIGN IS THE WORST AD CAMPAIGN EVER PROPOSED IN THE HISTORY OF TIME
You seem a little less persuasive than usual !
Do we fight ?
It kinda just seems like you're saying corporate slogans back and forth .
Oh , hey , Dromiceiomimus ! How's - how are things ?
You think I should be serving under Air Marshal Today Is What You Make Of It ?
But that means - God lied to me ! . . . Unless he was proposing a hypothetical situation , which in retrospect he was 100 % doing .
Anything ? ?
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS RIGHT NOW : The 10 People You WISH Loved You . . . And The One That Actually Does !
And since communication is free , spammers are soon running around yelling about their boner pills !
Certainly no SOCIOPATHIC reason .

I mean my non - bhangra remixes , of course !
I know !
Last year I was a bear !
Hey , let's start doing this right now !
Only we can't call it that because it sounds stupid .
Anyway , yeah !
" Sherlock ! " Watson said , looking down at his friend and consulting detective completely covered in duck feathers , " What have you deduced yourself into THIS time ? ? "
I'd better run !
No , when you say short pithy things it's even worse .
Unlimited data transmission with only TWO NUMBERS , baby !
But it's understood that people will try to be polite , so this insincerity is okay !
Thanks , but I'm not done yet !
But that's ONLY if you die years from now AND spend all your time until then investing your money carefully .
No way ! There's no way . " T - Rex " is a great name and IF I were to change it , it would be to " T - Tex " , and ONLY if I had a guarantee of oversized cowboy hats .
But after that , it's totally helium !
SCIENCE DEMANDS IT , DISNEY / TIME - WARNER
oh hello there t - rex ! it's super nice to see a friendly face today
Here are some phrases that we need to be saying more often , cats and kittens !
Utahraptor ! I - T - Rex : I have just unlocked " wicked sweet large "
holy crap holy crap HOLY CRAAAAP
" PLAN OMEGA : "
YES . I figure , existing words are already familiar to everyone , so I'll just expand their semantics ! Plasticized now means both " irreproachably amazing " AND " past participle of 'plasticize' " . And it's for teens , because teens are the thin edge of the language wedge !
It just bothers me that they're trying to make it sounds like a big thing when it's just business as usual ! That's deceptive .
Bro I tried to get with this woman but she totally put me in the friend zone ! !
I just can't get enough of this one song ( The Beach Boys : Help Me Rhonda ) ! I think I'll play it on repeat for 49 minutes .
The fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness , and that he got married . Legal records are all we've got ! His interests and tastes , politics and loves & # 8212 ; they all have to be ( unreliably ) extrapolated from his writing .
It's funny when people use it , because how long can you be bicurious ? You don't sit around all day saying , " Hmmm . . . I wonder what will happen ! " - you look it up on the Internet , or you go out , meet someone in the gender you're interested in , and then afterwards roll over and say , " Curiosity satisfied ! "
Yeah , but it's insta - death for the player !
Utahraptor
Okay , okay , check this out , Dromiceiomimus : " You are so beautiful to me , and I want to tell you just how much I love you / I was born to love you / Let's never stop falling in love / Love hurts / But / I would do anything for love " .
Whew ! What a fantastic nap !
" Sometimes I wonder if this is what I was meant to be doing in life "
I wonder sometimes
You're trying to trip me up here but I'm ALSO rad at dog names ; your dog will be named after the Star Trek physician and be called " Doctor McCoy " .
Why , I still take immense pleasure in stomping on this conveniently placed log cabin .
Are you sure that's a good attitude , T - Rex ? Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to fulfill it !
Or " a new sort of animal that's like a T - Rex except it can eat more and live forever " .
Hello ? That's the world record for Longest Time Taken To Push A Disabled Tractor Through A Stupid Digestive Tract . That doesn't count !
It's not that hard ! You just imagine being good , and then don't do that .
OH SNAP ! Who just got burned by his best friend for some mild criticism ?
Exactly .
Prettiness tests !
Isn't it CRAZY how young some people are when they get married ?
It turns out you can't make a law saying " dudes nobody say this guy's name anymore okay " without saying his name SOMEWHERE ? But , I mean , I understand why they were upset . Kind of a dick move , Herostratus . I want to go down in history , but not for being the world's Suckiest Greek .
You can't . It belongs to god .
You know what everyone knows we're doing just because it's a photo ? SMILING .
There ! I see just such a thing for me to stomp . But then are all things not equal under mine , the mightiest of feet ?
Any day , my friend !
Hey , did you vote ?
THAT'S SUCH A SUCKY PRANK
He talked about paninis ?
I like them !
Oh wait I left my spear on the ground back there , one sec
No , I've just never heard reincarnation including things that , you know - aren't alive .
AND INCLUDE ME ON THE LIST
You're right ; I apologize .
And before anyone cries " boo hoo hoo dictionaries reflect language and shouldn't be creating it " , let me just say I'M using " dord " to mean density RIGHT NOW , and if you join me , we can create the improved dictionaries we deserve . Not just for us : for our CHILDREN .
That's only part of it !
Okay ! First off , put all your characters in a boat RIGHT AWAY .
It's a good thing nobody remembers THAT LITTLE DETAIL when they first decide to become pals !
" You're the champ at life choices , and this baby you're now responsible for for the next 18 years PROVES it ! "
Man in the future I ain't gonna get nothing but prosecuted
Can you imagine , Dromiceiomimus ?
. . . which is great , because that's what you'll be doing for the next 13 cycles !
Hah hah ! Ouch for Timmy !
COME CLOSER , T - REX
Don't look at me . He's YOUR boyfriend , Mary .
I guess so !
It still gets processed , dude !
Well , rad , but they should put that on the forms . " This apple costs $ 1 plus 15c to keep civilization here . Those extra cents are for keeping murders in jail ! ! Dude , nicely done ! You did us a solid ! "
Bombs bombs bombs .
Yes !
Yeah !
Down with T - Rex !
No regrets , Utahraptor ! !
Maybe THAT !
Well , yesterday I seemed to annoy my friends with my choice of the oddly - obscene word " earhole " . Excuse me !
My calculation will be complete ?
THEY LIKE THE JOKES YOU'VE SAID : THAT'S SOMEONE YOU SHOULD WED
Spider - Man was still eating nasty cake . " I am a character owned by another corporation , and you are not a valid licensee " he spat out , along with the cake , which he was already spitting out . It was gross and rude !
Wowza bowza ! I got , like , half a vomit stuck in my throat .
Really good news ! Great news ! !
. . . NOW .
IF YOU ARE UNINTERESTED IN HEARING MY TREATISE ON COMPUTER CONTROLLED STORYTELLING I WILL FIND A MORE RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE
But also a place where I can talk so that strangers who want to listen in on me can hear me talking to my friends . Okay , that's a thing . I guess that's fin though ?
Pals !
It doesn't make you " weak " to have allergies , T - Rex !
Uh , EXCUSE ME , but deep knowledge of canon only adds to the appreciation of scifi properties !
And this is a close up !
Oh my God ! It's him ! I'm sure of it . It's totally him !
You can verify the science thing !
Bad news , everyone !
Man , this toast is pretty okay , but you realize you should probably turn to panel 2 .
Even though we're super close and I've known you for years and years , it seems PERFECTLY REASONABLE to me that you'd have a name you never told me . PS : I am an adult .
This contest doesn't even make sense in the first place .
It's Christmas Eve ! Why do I feel like I'm forgetting . . .
Potatoes : The tasty treat that grows beneath your feet !
Fine !
And THAT concludes my many opinions about the fallacy of balance !
It happened yesterday , shortly after I was complaining about advertising slogans !
ANOTHER A + + REVIEW ! !
FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS :
MUSIC : NOT EVEN ONCE
Well , why don't you just check to see what others are doing ?
Maybe it's a thing ? Turn to panel 5 !
I wonder what it's like being a ghost . Immortality coupled with incorporeality seems like a potent combination ! Is it TRULY 24 / 7 party times ?
Hey , T - Rex , I -
Will the sign be preserved ?
When you measure things in 4000 BC Earths , things get kinda crazy !
Nice going , potential future parent !
I can't help it if I can't remember it !
Sherlock Holmes knocked on T - Rex's door . " I deduce that you are home , good buddy ! " the world's greatest detective except Batman said .
Luckily , I am just the dude to manufacture such excuses ! I have the perfect plan . Since it sucks to be the only dude in the room wearing a cape , I will simply start telling people that EXISTING holidays are now cape - wearing holidays . Like . . . Thanksgiving !
Embrace the romance of my new problem
And then you throw in an orphan with a crutch ! And a little girl holding the limp string and rubbery plastic remains of her only birthday gift this year , a balloon with the words " Happy Birthday Naseem ! " printed on it . The girl's name is Jenn .
I call this condition " Appetite Asperger's " !
I just thought it was a skill I could pick up easily . I don't need to know everything ! I don't need to know the difference between friggin' binary and B + search trees ! ALL I WANT TO KNOW is how to make Richard III's sucky horse do double jumps , you know ?
Um , " BUSINESS " ? ?
Yes ! ! The person who sent this card loves you so much !
Oh yeah ? Says you , Utahraptor !
THEY READ THE PANEL !
Dude , sex by yourself can be pretty neat too ! You know that saying about how if you want to become truly great at something , you just need to practice EVERY DAY ? ? Well WALK IT OFF , BABIES , becaise I found out what happens if you practice EVERY HOUR ! !
And I can totally use this knowledge to design my OWN clothes .
He actually stabs out his eyes becuase he realizes he's murdered his father and married his mother .
I didn't ! DID I ? ?
You'll find him everywhere from 5th century Europe to modern - day London , and beyond ! His travels take him through space and time , though he does spend an AWFUL amount of time on Earth . And if he gets too old , or injured , or the person in the role doesn't want the job anymore , a regeneration process begins after which we all get to see a new version of this guy with a new body and altered personality ! One last hint : he's ALWAYS a man , and he travels in a UNIQUE VEHICLE .
I actually think this has been done before , T - Rex !
computers please drive me everywhere , i trust you more than i trust other humans ] ]
WHY
. . . WITH A 5 % ROYALTY SHARE ON GROSS .
Guyyyyys
On our boat , the sails and sailors alike are . . . * taut * .
And then I thought , even if he is going to spend it on drugs , is it my job to deny him money ? Should I go around enforcing my morality on others ? And then I thought , geez man , how ridiculous am I that a guy asking for change throws me into these throes of self - doubt and analysis ?
Oranges are orange , and if you press them , an orange juice called " orange juice " comes out . Their honest and straightforward approach easily earns oranges our coveted # 1 spot .
" Maybe you wanna make friends with your racist aunt ? " it'll say . " No ? How about someone you kinda remember from high school who got pregnant ? Yes ? PERFECT . Have some photos of the child of this barely recalled stranger . "
What are you talking about , T - Rex ?
But then they wake up and discover THEY BOTH DREAMED THE SAME CHATS UP !
There's only one way to find out ! It seems that , once again , I will have to contract . . .
Pretty badass , you guys !
ALTERNATE ENDING COMICS
But T - Rex , this is nothing more than deifying the ego , defiant of conventional morality !
That's like complaining when Princess Leia falls for Han Solo !
ANYWAY ! T - REX'S MOST IMPORTANT DAY HAS ALREADY COME AND GONE ! IT LOOKED LIKE THIS :
If you love something , set it free !
If God's seen EVERYTHING in the entire universe , then he can say what's going to happen next ! He knows where everything is and where they're moving !
Your name is " Sexy Tom " ! You wanna be known for more than just your sexiness . If that's not your name , turn to panel 2 !
Really ! They're actually discreetly observing your breathing . They do it on the sly because if you're aware of it , it changes !
Well . . . it's just God . It's not like he's gonna broadcast it on the radio or anything .
Tell me about it ! OH WAIT YOU CAN'T SINCE WE'RE NOT LINGUISTIC .
Man ! YES ! You are on the ball with this pun ! You're hired !
Hi ! I'm a guy who ignores the cashier while loudly talking on my cell phone !
Anyway , that's a possibility or whatever ! !
Oh hah hah
Hello there , consumer ! Did you know that a diamond is FOREVER , just like the love between two people with finite lifespans ?
No way it's that high !
ANYWAY !
Woooohoooo !
So what'll make your artificial language different from , say , Esperanto ?
Wouldn't each god's stats be at zero then ?
IN A DO - OR - DIE BATTLE
Sleepytimes gets her Machine of Death reading and it says she'll be done in by flax !
Okay - lemons !
There are times when I'm glad you lack the skill to make games take place , T - Rex .
Self improvement isn't a trivia context , T - Rex !
Oh frig , you guys ! !
I've TOLD you all the creepy things they've said to me ! I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm UNCONSCIOUS and pyjama - clad around them ! Holy heck !
Okay , let me just check my mental list of inspirational quotes because I just glanced at a clock and I'm pretty sure it's
The Utahraptor ?
FUTURE UTAHRAPTOR ! I'm serious , I saw him ! He looked like Utahraptor , but he was aged thirty years , and it was the Most Amazing Thing . It couldn't have been anyone else ! It was CLEARLY thirty years older Utahraptor .
I will ! But wouldn't building an articulated robot version of yourself that you can climb inside and control have been closer to the best thing ever ?
So why did we think they were there in the first place ?
So he's got any power that can be described by an English adverb ending in " ly " ?
Put " to have and to hold " at the start and it's the complete story of our weekend ! !
Well , probably no - one , but by loudly demanding your software back , you're also loudly admitting to COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT .
So the only tip I've got is this !
So joining Annie McDonald's at Highcal High is June " the Whopper " King , the tall Jane Silver ( who passes as a man and uses the pseudonym " John " due to sexisms ) , The Taco Belle , Wendy ( this one was easy ) , and Kitty Fran Cooper , who goes by -
" Surge " is a way stronger brand ! You know what Surge is , Utahraptor ? It's the tastiest burger you ever ate , mixed in with your favourite musician who just got better , mixed in with next year's car models . This summer , get the urge . Surge .
Great ! I too will bring my wife .
I love & # 8212 ; you !
Today I have fully documented ONE WEEK of my life !
It's the future ! We write on tiny keyboards and on networks where each keystroke is at a premium . I'm not gonna spell out " therefore " when I can type " there4 " !
You'll love them even more now that they're awesome times !
A kid in a tree , and then the tree becomes enormous , and the kid is happy about that .
And as it turns out . . . it is not that awesome ?
And except for the fact that WAY more people on the face of the planet care about the economy than they do about buying me presents .
Hello Utahraptor ! How are you today ?
" Yo , how could we have been so wrong ? " they said . " We screwed the pooch on this one for sure . "
Hah ! CLASSIC 19th century France .
Now do " Somewhere Over The Rainbow " !
Scotty , I need war speed in three minutes or we're all dead !
Seriously ! I had some DOUBTS .
Am I that crazy . . . TO DREAM ?
Hah hah , looks like it's super weird to assign agency to your own brain !
print and save !
a prequel
we want pre - nup
so , it's an adult book store ? Adult novelties ?
I'm not buying one !
LITTERING COMICS
Aren't you and Dromi . . . ?
HOSPITAL COMICS
The Woman Who Woke Up As A Man
Um - a dilemma is for two choices : you had a trilemma there . Precision !
When I grow up I want to be an astronaut !
THIS IS AMAZING . I need to get big into something that if I'm ever done with my body , I can turn it into a thing for my friends ! I guess . . . I guess I knida like computers ?
" The door closes quickly , watch for it hitting you " .
And as a non - chump , this means I must find a way to be immortal !
Well , you can bolster it some , right ? Like , you could add on the price each your organs would fetch on a black market . That'd raise it some !
And you believe people will fall for this , no doubt !
The Lion King is a great movie !
In the end , I guess we all discovered . . . The Joy of Cooking
Waterpark , Utahraptor !
Man , I STILL haven't solved any world issues ! This is like a mid - life crisis , except it's been ongoing since I was six !
. . . then I keep taking 2 / 3rds off that number until I end up at 0 .
Wait ! Wait , I can do this .
( Though Whether Or Not You Miss It Is Not Really Up To You , Actually )
It's not often you can see how language is evolving , but you can totally see it today with make and female nouns .
Sometimes I feel the only purpose of our universe is to act as a warning for others
People start getting bit , dying , then getting up and feasting on the flesh of the living . Batman and Robin are fighting them off as best they can , and while they're too fast and acrobatic to be touched , there's too many zombies to kill them all . They start rescuing as many people as they can , taking them to the Batcave for safekeeping . It's a good place because it's not only big , but protected and hidden !
- My Fingers !
One in seven Canadians is living with a disability !
Dromiceiomimus , I am crushing this house because , holy , what if the people inside are really sad about something ? By smushing them , I increase net happiness on the planet over the long term , because they won't be sad anymore , ALSO , stomping makes me happy . Net happiness : increased !
Let's use our curiosity and intelligence to their full potential . Let's solve every problem we see . Let's make any other state of being jealous of how IMPOSSIBLY RAD we are .
Ooh ! I get to be the T - Rex !
It's a popular name ! And all I'm gonna do is invent a new verb : JENNIF . Then , suddenly , everyone named Jennifer is saying that they are the ones who jennif ! They LOVE to jennif . They are JENNIFERS .
Oh yeah , BOSSES are why not
They probably realized what a great dinosaur I'd be and figured it would be in their own interests to creat me !
We - we was being straight out socially irresponsible .
What's left ? Only to accept the absurd and try to find any meaning we can in our own personal journey from life to death !
WHO KNOWS ?
That's gross .
About websites !
Could it be you have a CRUSH on flappers , my friend ?
The day before yesterday ?
Anger logic says that anything that makes me mad is dumb and I hate it !
So your favourite weather is : wind .
I know ! And it's all thanks to sperm !
It's the best gift ! If things go well then years later people will say " How did you two meet ? " and he can say " T - Rex hooked us up for Chistmas ! BEST GIFT EVER ! ! " and then they can high five !
And at the south pole Amundsen left a letter for me , asking that I deliver it to the King of Norway . Apparently he's . . . the biggest jerk ?
Hey , nice move , T - Rex !
" Oh , how adorable ! "
Except this wasn't a great solution on some ships : the SS Eastland in particular was already a pretty top - heavy ship , and the new lifeboats kinda made the problem critical . And on the 24th of July 1915 , when the Eastland was docked and taking on passangers - all Western Electric employees on their way to a company picnic - she rolled over and sank !
Attention , everybody ! !
If you do pull off that dick move , I am sorry , but I will end you . People will find your body and say " Dear lord ! was he a dick at merging ? Probably , huh ? "
I won't lie ! I've done it ! !
T - REX I'M GOD AND I SAY THAT IS NOT A VERY GOOD JOKE
Then you can look at the lawyer and make your own decision ! Tying someone's physical appearance to their job is terrible . How'd you feel if everyone in your class was a studentkapow , but you were just a student ?
Hell , I'm a monster and you're bigger than ME !
Well I suppose if we're being exact all I've done is come up with the IDEA of inventing a new way to do an existing thing with computers !
Yeah , I guess so .
Let's pretend we are . . .
Is it murder if you're literally asking for it ?
T - Rex ! !
I'm not as skinny as I used to be !
Today is a good day I think to talk about pretension !
NO DUDE . YOU ARE TOTALLY ALONE .
Sometimes what ?
Today is the day I cook a meal for all my friends ! You're coming , right God ?
We were CRAZY DUDES in high school ! !
We're being relative here ; it has to be different from everyone else around me . Wouldn't it be great if I sounded like Dame Judi Dench , Dromiceiomimus ? I mean , a male version ? Ooh , or like Cary Grant ! I could sound like the platonic form of charming , suave , unreliable and debonair MANHOOD .
Why haven't you got a university degree yet ?
Attention , folks with low self - esteem !
May I answer the question ?
Do you think people will call into a show with that title , T - Rex ? They'd be , you know , tacitly admitting that their problems are stupid .
Super ! I've never said this , but I love how when you come over for dinner you always bring some wine . It's old - school classiness !
skin flavoured jello
A CONTROVERSIAL ass , though ! Of fame !
Golden - Age Superman powers let you breathe on the moon ?
500 years ago a song wouldn't be good if some dude talked all over the music !
But wouldn't it be SO AWESOME to discuss your own awesomeness in open court , that it would be a special case ?
The emphasis on male oppression is continued as I stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man - foot .
But you're moving !
" Back to you , Utahraptor ! "
BACK AT HOME . . .
T - REX IS HELPING A FRIEND MOVE .
What , you were The Mighty Thor ?
Utahraptor , guess what ?
BIKING TIPS FOR TEENS
Hah hah ! Nobody knows my rad password is " by storing this in your database you admit T - Rex is 1000 % awesome and that you owe him $ 5000 ! ! STORING THESE WORDS MARKS YOUR CONSENT ; NO BACKSIES ALLOWED . "
Interesting
Okay , T - Rex , you've got a firt dat tonight . If there's a romantic moment and she looks into your eyes , don't lock eyes with her and whisper " boners " ! !
T - REX IN : " THE SALTINE CHALLENGE ! "
CLASSIC APHORISMS REPHRASED
After moving in together , the Beach Boys take a trip to Surf City , where there's two women for every man !
Oh my gosh YES .
don't say it
Maybe you should write something about it !
DEDICATED TO MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIASTS AROUND THE WORLD
Hah hah ! AWESOME
What value !
Let's spend another decade making it so it can say other stuff too , okay ?
They do though .
ACTUALLY WAIT I NEVER BLOCKED THAT ONE
I tell you man , I was all over the logic books in high school !
Why - why a tarantula ?
IS IT ADJECTIVE ENOUGH FOR YOU ? ?
I hope people like my bones !
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY MADE BATMAN TRAINS
So the first thing you need to know is that everything is crazy in English and nothing makes sense .
I dunno , I think I liked " T - Rex " better !
I've come into possession of the most advanced AI on the planet . Neato ! So , um , what do I do with it ?
Okay ! It's a very nice idea , but it's not science because it's not disprovable : you either believe in intelligent design or you don't , and there's no way to show who's right . That's not science - that's faith !
But this isn't just a ploy to seem more comely to members of the attractive sex ! I really feel like I need a goal to work towards , something that I want to achieve . In the past I've always just gone with the flow !
IT'S THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF THIGNS YOU CAN LIKE ON PINTEREST
You APPEAR to help the Nazis in the film , but then you let me get away with murdering one at the end so that Ilsa and her weaksauce husband can go to America . The movie should really be about OUR relationship !
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TERROR FOR THE PRINTED WORD ? ?
Everytime I tried to tell you
It's just - every time you mention that you love Mr . Tusks , you mention that he's a tiny elephant . You treat his tiny elephant status as if it sums up his entire personality !
This is dumb .
MOOT POINT
Whoops , right ! I gotcha . I will keep things " on the down low " . It's our secret ! Our secret IDENTITY !
Don't worry ! One in seven Canadians will die of an infectious disease before they can suicide ! PLUS they'll leave money to charity !
Anyway , LONG STORY SHORT :
Hi guys ! It turns out the reason adults don't go trick - or - treating is because you get berated at every house for being too old ! Also some kids tricked me and stole my costume !
YEARS LATER : PROMISES ARE BROKEN .
That's me , baby ! !
. . . So is there a ghost in that field or what
And I guess all the pain and death in the world is also just to make things more interesting ?
Do you love tacos ?
It's not my fault ! I didn't name a phone thing " Android " ! !
But you know what I am good at ? Motivation . In my house RIGHT NOW sits a $ 5 bill that I will mail to the FIRST PERSON who cures all diseases , no questions asked !
I'm an American named Rick and I have two free tickets to America !
IT'S A FRIED CHICKEN PARTS STORE , OKAY ?
UTAHRAPTOR'S MANLIEST MAN :
Huh ! Maybe the best way to learn about prenups is to get one . Oh my gosh , Utahraptor ! ! Let's get a " friendship prenup " !
Depends ; what's the line ?
T - REX YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON LEFT ALIVE ON EARTH WHAT DO YOU DO
Not really ! I just would like to be thought of fondly once in a while . Every time someone puts out a fire would be often enough for me !
The next paragraph is " BOO ! "
OKAY WHAT WORK IS IT
But you're not .
Ladies and gentlemen : is it time for a new catchphrase ?
Does " Stern Librarian ( Nonsexy ) " pique your interest ? Perhaps you'd be interested in " Wacky Landlord ( Actually Racist ) " , " Sage Older Man " or " Overheated , Panting Dog " ? Maybe your interests rum more to " Astonished Plutocrat with Monocle " , " Rapping Dickensian Orphan " , or " Puking Anthropomorphized Park Slide " ?
NIIIIIIIIIICE
IT WAS FULL OF WIENERS DUDE
But we don ; t know anything about alien life ! Maybe they'll look just like us AND share diseases with us , but with pointier ears . And logic ?
Shit !
What do you think , Dromiceiomimus ? Am I going crazy ? Am I finishing off the milk and then COMPLETELY FORGETTING ABOUT IT ?
Oh man ! ANYTHING I WANT ! !
Ohhhh , my hot water heater's out again and I don't know what to say !
Or rather , they WERE , until Superman blew on them with his freeze breath !
Larry Niven already invented T - Rex's Law ? That's crazy !
Hah ! There's a lot of crazy things about sociopaths . The whole callous unconcern for the feeling of others , incapacity to feel guilt and to profit from past experience , and disregard for social norms , for example !
Nice try , Utahraptor !
EXPANDED SNEEZE COMICS
Like AND share !
It's ALL the famous plays ! All's Well that Begins Well ! Prince Lear ! Romeo and Juliet Babies ! That one's Romeo and Juliet , only they're tiny and smelly . "
Trivially !
THIS IS NOT REAL INFORMATION , T - REX !
" Also , " Watson said , strapping himself in besides his friend and partner , " you run around too quickly . I'm writing down your actions as well and that takes time , okay ? " He snapped his seatbelt into place , sighing . " Did you know , " Watson said , " that I have had to replace entire speeches of yours with 'Elementary ! ' because I couldn't write down what you said fast enough ? I'm not joking . Slow down , man . "
MAN I'M BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING BUT i NEVER GET THE CREDIT FOR HOW PEOPLE'S HEADS EXPLODE WHEN SEEING SOMETHING REALLY SURPRISING
I supp -
Oh sure !
I have compiled a list of people I enjoy seeing ! A list , if you will . . .
Dude , why use Sherlock ?
I - I really do .
I've nearly killed MYSELF with my own stupidity tons of times , let alone someone else ! I once ate broken glass because it was at the bottom of a half - eaten bag of chips ! As I ate them I thought " gosh these chips are real crunchy " .
Depends on what a chicken egg is !
" JUST THEN I WONDERED WHY I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT YOUR OWN RECENT HISTORY "
I could use some more friends , actually . I tried calling an escort service once but it turns out that is a euphemism and all the people there were just interested in sex for money !
Well , people know what politics are , and " world politics " is just a straightforward application of the adjective .
Let's have songs about REAL LIFE : raps about running out of salt and thinking 'wow when was the last time I bought salt ? " . Raps about thinking how ridiculous it is to have to buy salt when it's in the oceans for free . Raps about considering if you could take extra salt off the sidewalk in winter and save money that way . Is it edible ?
I wonder what the world would be like if I had never been born !
My mouth has a nice fresh taste in it this morning !
Yes . Allow me to correct that !
UMMMMM
Huh . I guess it is when it works out ? It takes time from my work though , and my boss can be a real slavedriver .
THAT NIGHT , T - REX VISITS A RADIO STATION AND INSISTS ON TALKING ABOUT BATMAN :
Man ! I know it !
That's good . I'm fine too . Do I seem level - headed to you ? I's because I am not exclaiming anything . I am calm and reserved . You might be reaching for a word . That word is " unflappable " .
Just because there are different religions with different opinions on things , he dismisses them all ?
But I want to be in the GOOD BOOKS ! ! !
My friend , it was so crazy it was OFF THE HOOK .
I think that people know what the bases are - but if they don't , that's cool too !
( Even though it is the classy thing to do ! )
COMICS IN WHICH GOD HIMSELF QUOTES WERNER HERZONG .
EVERY NIGHT ?
I have begun to receive insulting spam messages : really vitriolic ones !
Honestly , you should fly an " X " flag above your house ! That means " Everyone , stop what you're doing and WATCH FOR MY SIGNAL . "
I'm a nice guy ! ! I'm always there for people I like when they need me !
. . . Alright , I've decided . I'm not going to change my name if it ONLY works in the event of my horrific death , Dromiceiomimus .
Okay ! Here come the mysteries of the universe !
But ?
Sure , but not everyone can be popular !
T - Rex , forever is INFINITY LONG . Even if you're super careful and have only 1 in 10 trillion chance of dying on the stairs , how often can you expect that happens if you live , oh , I don't know , 10 TRILLION YEARS ?
Antonio Tony woke up in a world without friction ! All around him things were sliding around like crazy !
And it turns out I was TOTALLY CORRECT !
PRECISELY CORRECT
Live and learn , bitches !
That takes into account times I hit my head on low - hanging chandeliers , and times when enemies punch my head . Okay , so that's , what - 243 days of consciousness a year ? 66 % of the year . I've had almost 18 years of consciousness since I was born .
Man ! I don't ! !
Utahraptor must never know I've been making friends with dog owners purely to gain access to the friendship of their dogs !
BACKSTORY : SUCH A PHRASE EXISTS FOR T - REX , AND PEOPLE HAVE COME CLOSE TO SAYING IT IN THE PAST :
And EVERYONE ALIVE TODAY had ancestors in 1837 who either had or would have sexual congress producing offspring !
I give you the first line of Max Shulman's " Sleep Till Noon " : " Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Four shots ripped into my groin and I was off on the greatest adventure of my life !
All contiguous polar ground snow now either is a part of " Frosty " 's body or falls under his control : the distinction is no longer relevant . The presence of Agent 95 on the Barneo ice floe appears to have awakened the creature , as snow is extracting itself from the permafrost and collecting near the North Pole . We believe we're witnessing the creation of a new , colossal , Snow Man .
Does that mean you understand me ? How am I to know ?
SOON , T - REX DECIDES TO CHAT UP BABES AFTER ALL :
In Scrabble , you and your friends pretend that you're unable to speak OR write , but luckily , you have a bunch of tiny pieces of wood with letters on them in your pockets ! You each grab a handful and take turns chatting up each other .
Satisfied , North hurtles headlong toward destiny .
FINE . So my explosion - themed remakes don't sell because everyone's big into sequels now . But I can roll with the times ! * ahem *
Guys !
So I'm walking down the street with Utahraptor and there's this guy walking in the opposite direction , coming towards me .
Am I doing the right thing with my life ? What if what I'm doing with my time is actually something I will one day regret ? What I NEED is some way to measure regret for every action and career path .
Tra - la - la .
And I'm sorry to be the one to break an ENTIRE INDUSTRY , but nobody cares about your name real - estate agents . There's a reason Coke is called Coke and not " John Pemberton's Weird Slurry " and Apple isn't called " Ronald Wayne " and McDonalds isn't called - okay this is a bad example , but you get my point .
If you were his friend you'd always say " Come on Al , stop drinking , change your name . At least go by your middle name . " And then he'd take a swig from the bottle , wipe his mouth with the back of his hand , and tell you his middle name is " Choc " .
Yes , I don't know how it happened but it's true ! Wikipedia is a woman now .
But then our enemies would retaliate in kind !
What ? No , of course not !
Or perhaps I don't want to say " I WANT TO GET MARRIED SOMEDAY " because if I never meet someone then I've FAILED at a life plan . Much better to say " I WANT TO GET INTO A BOAT SOMEDAY " and then just sit in some dude's boat ! IN FACT , I'm going to the docks right now !
Or perhaps like this !
POSTPONED .
" Wendy here : people say your breakups are a chance for personal growth , but I've discovered the best growth comes through deep interpersonal relationships that only get better and more fulfilling every day you share them . "
Dude ! It's SO GOOD .
First I need a secret identity , but I've already god that . Then I need an origin story , but I can figure that out later . What's most important is fighting crime !
I'm - I dunno . I guess I'm worried only about getting one shot at life and messing it up , or not making the best of it .
- aaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH -
That doesn't make my parents awesome !
MAN T - REX YOU'RE ABOUT 3 SECONDS AWAY FROM FATAL RADIATION EXPOSURE YOURSELF
SECRETS .
PROBABLY I CAN BORROW ONE
Middle ages dudes assembled them as representing the ultimate man . They threw in some goddy ones too , like David of Goliath fame .
A DISAPPOINTING DAY
Not knowing what's appropriate for a web - card for another !
Then here we go !
Well , this has been quite the anagnorisis ( a moment of recognition or discovery ) !
" Open the fridge " : tie a rope to your fridge's handle , and encourage the dog to tug . When the door opens , reward the dog . Shorten the rope until the dog opens the fridge by its handle . Congratulations ! You have given an animal access to your fridge !
I feel like you haven't thought this out , T - Rex .
So you were That Guy at the restaurant !
There ! Sex AND politics !
Sweet large !
We can just return to our utopia of old , before money turned us all into greedy , money - obsessed , quasi - people ! Right , Dromiceiomimus ? Right ! Money is an aberration that lessens us all ! We don't need it !
It's one way of looking at it !
Go ahead !
Aw , I'm sorry ! I meant I'll see you at Pizza Hole because the " fill your holes " promo is ending and this is our last chance to get our holes filled !
Rivers expand , basements flood
Probably I just want to make things more interesting !
Who cares ? ! You've got a second chance at life ! Turn to panel 6 to live life to its fullest ! !
T - REX I KINDA JUST TOLD THE STORY TO EVERYONE IN HEAVEN
Once you have that partner , then ALL YOU HAVE TO DO is commit to them for the rest of your life , and they to you ! It's really that easy ! It's like buying a Game Boy , opening it up , and then saying , " Yes , this is enough . I will never get tired of Tetris . "
Others believe you should name the child after whatever colour blood is , hence names like " Ruby " , " Rusty " , and " Scarlet " .
There ain't a word in the spec that I don't know / for example the < tr > tag means a new table row !
So really you're suspecting bad drivers of being not you .
I think the coolest thing about ASL , which is the sign language I know , is how you can place nouns in space . If I'm telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend , I can make the sign for " dog " to my left , and " friend " to my right , and then when I want to apply adjectives to them , I just sign " angry " or " sassy " in the same physical space as the nouns ! You can have nouns FLOATING AROUND YOU in conversation . How is that not the best thing EVER ?
Why do we say " rest in peace " ? Is it just -
Whoah , hold up !
Wait , that's not a joke ! Dude , that's literally what happens to us ! ! Ahhh !
We need to track down a pope and say we have a religious question , but can only conceptualize it in terms of murder and video games !
Game Boys are like 15 years old !
Well , let's be glad no such person exists then !
Are vitamins and minerals required for our bodies to function ?
The place : Earth . The time : whenever Earth's inhabitants finally invent ships cool enough to take them into space .
hhuuh
I'M UNSURE HOW CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BROUGHT US HERE , new friends , but Utahraptor's pretty rad . He's got pointy toes so when you say " this contract has a good CLAWS in it " he'll roll his eyes .
Is it ? Or is it that SMS shorthand is cryptic and distancing and incredibly difficult to take seriously ? Are we going to live in a future where cops actually write " Sry but ur bro'z ded ? "
It's not like you to respond so emotionally to something like this , T - Rex ! Why don't you just respond to their points and disprove their claims ?
They're that sexy .
BUT DID IT ? ?
Don't date my siblings , T - Rex !
A DEAD END !
Like if you agree ! !
What ? Oh , yes ! That's right , other dinosaur , it's me , your life - long friend , T - Rex !
Hello ? Skynet ? Every time you get a bunch of AIs together , they INEVITABLY decide that things would be better if all physical life was dead .
I'm of the belief that some businessmen who are never in the office could really use them , but that most people don't REALLY need one . Therefore , they are allowed to be teased by me !
BETTER NAMES FOR THINGS
A prison organizes a wilderness trip for its inmates , many of whom have never set foot outside the city . The inmates struggle with the basics of camping , but learn a lot from the land - and each other . Together they build a . . .
People with synesthesia BASICALLY have super powers .
So why is the ship called " Titanic " ?
But if I want to build a family in the classical way - and I'm not sure that I do , but I might in the future - I need to get on that now !
Maybe I will .
Hah ! . . . What ?
I do ! And as I recall , it went a little something like this . . .
If it is , add more naked sex aliens .
Really ? !
- this is why people decide to go live in the woods forever
Easy ! Just patronize businesses . For example , I myself have a nodding relationship with a cashier at the grocery store , and many bus drivers are women .
Your cookie can increase in value though !
Yeah , or what if one of us is dead ?
A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN
The way I figure it , after about five years we gain the ability to look back on anything and laugh , and I can reasonably say " Oh , but I was young and stupid back then ! " . So , BASICALLY , I'm going to wait five years and then stop worrying about it .
I just -
And then I would like some of the remaining carbon to be made into pencils and the pencils be given to my pals for them to draw with , and then a year after I die I would like for there to be an art show of all the awesome T - Rex pencil pictures , please !
I use deep - packet inspection to add it to ALL INCOMING INTERNET TRAFFIC . Even websites now flirt with me !
T - Rex I know you are enjoying that song
MAN , I miss dates
I will call this day " Dinosaur Present Day , Featuring T - Rex " !
Hah ! Good one !
What a delightful film !
But maybe they absorb only a small amount of non - visible spectrum light and they live in space and that's what dark matter is ? ?
Profits ! !

I am a dude who came across a suitcase full of old love letters I got in high school . Sweet !
WE NEED YOUR TORSO ?
I think I have a problem , guys .
Are you trying to be . . . um , everything that I like in a woman ?
Luckily , inventing new words is easy . Hey , here's one : " boner " .
I believe I would call it " Get Biscuits , Pal , Or Go To An Early Gravy . "
everyone named " jennifer " will probably hate him
Four is the worst ! Also , FIVE , I wish my body would poop more instead of putting on weight .
Okay , so what if I said I wanted to break up ?
FIVE HANDY PANELS TO GET YOU THROUGH LIFE
So what's up ? What went wrong ?
Um - I have nothing bad to say about sign language , the end !
. . . " radditude " ?
So how's the problem - solving going ?
Hey , T - Rex , I've a favor to ask ! Can you tell me when seven minutes have passed ?
Where are you taking her ?
INTERNET OSTRICH MEAT STICKS :
ANGOLA MALDIVES WILL RETURN
Personally , I'M going to eat a lot of junk food , since who cares about heart disease now ? NOT ME !
Aw , really ? All at once or in li'l bites ?
# 1 WORST DEATHBED REGRET : today's winner
Hey , what were you guys talking about ?
" It is a difficult challenge to compare a diurnal cycle to the only English definite article , but : like a summer's day , " the " has three main sections : beginning ( the letter 't' , or " morning " ) , middle ( the letter 'h' , or " lunchti -

Serious concern ? I just stepped on a tiny woman , so her only influence on the climate is that now she's dead .
IN MY LAST BOOK I SAID HE'S JUST NOT INTO YOUR TASTE IN MUSIC BUT WHAT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO TELL YOU WAS THAT HE'S & # 8212 ; HE'S GREAT
That's a pretty crazy theory !
And you play as a friend or family member , staring at your body , wondering where it all went wrong . People can always surprise you , can't they ? But that doesn't mean the surprises are going to be good ones .
Oh , of course . You don't have the means to do what he does .
. . . LIVE ? ?
Stay with me ! !
What is the purpose of my life ?
Life's funny that way ! ?
Yeah ! You were down because you've got this impossible fetish , but it turns out the second law of thermodynamics is one of the few STATISTICAL laws of physics - which means it's not actually impossible for an egg to randomly descramble itself for a while ! It's just FANTASTICALLY unlikely .
Your final few years live will be spent being successful and winning awards and kissing attractive people while you're both naked !
Dudes : that is correct !
And that's the origin of the phrase " balls to the wall " .
If you drop something heavy on your foot , your first instinct is likely to scream in pain .
Are you really interested ? Is this your way of showing interest ? I could tell you all about it if you want .
Freshly waxed , with a GPS tracking system ?
Well , I suppose that begs the question , T - Rex : if it's used more often to mean " raises the question " than " a fallacy of presumption " , doesn't that suggest that the definition of the phrase has evolved ?
I don't have a son , but if I did , I'd have no idea what to name him .
Exactly ! It's like the placebo effect !
Yep , he's being pretty noisy about it !
The Devil , does that answer your question ?
You don't hear that ?
Hah ! Aw ! That's terrible , T - Rex !
AND IT WAS .
But Shakespeare wrote it for a CHARACTER , which doesn't mean that he personally believed it . You can write a story about a mad scientist and not actually want to wear retro aviator goggles all the time .
We're putting ego ASIDE today , Utahraptor .
Hello , T - Rex ! I'm here to be taught how to be a sailor , as was promised to me .
But that's even crazier ! I can't think of another crime that becomes legal if you have a corporate structure around it , if you've built a viable business around the production and distribution of that crime .
Huh ? You don't like spam protection systems ?
Anyway , what I meant was this : how do we know what food we ate contributed to which parts of our bodies ? Put simply , Professor , last week I ate a salami sandwich . I have but one simple question : IS THAT SALAMI NOW MY BRAIN ? ?
But do you want to reproduce with tacos ?
But my clock is ticking
Star cop Jack Ready is undercover as " Slice Norway " , a slicer from Norway . But when his cover's blown , he has to take on the mob alone . This summer . . .

Holy crap .
Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles !
All I need is a way to convert mathematical truths to the real world and I WILL NEVER BE WRONG AGAIN !
FALSE
Not just cool temperature - wise , but cool in that it made me look good . Too good . But I had to look good , because my first case of the day was my ex - wife , Fran . Turns out she was bein' blackmailed . Couldn't say by who , but I had a pretty good idea of who it might be . The night was turning out to be a real night . . . to remember .
I'M SUDDENLY EXTREMELY AWARE THAT THAT'S THE MOST TRUE SENTENCE I'M EVER LIKELY TO SAY
I like trains because they're big complicated machines that NOT ONLY get folks places quickly , but also , threaten maidens tied to the tracks by mustachio - twirling villains . If horses could do that I would like horses too .
I didn't know they'd be engraving it live
So - at the end of the day , what does this prove , T - Rex ?
Debateable !
So I've been doing RESEARCH . I've been going to Comedy Club after Komedy Klub and figuring out how their performers make jokes . It's easy to duplicate the bad comedians , but it's hard to figure out the good ones !
. . . But honestly , mostly friends ? ?
I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again . Evidentialism
Wouldn't we be able to tell ?
God ! Someone sent YOU a letter for once ! Name's a " Charles 'Cheeks' Anderson " .
The afterlife sure is awesome and definitely not full of garbage at all ! !
T - Rex ! Cut it out !
- THAT ONE TIME , IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE -
But are there really a lot of these words ?
That happens if these turn out not to be true ?
I just want to talk about sex in the new year !
Guys , guys - our gold medals are made of solid and delicious CHOCOLATE ! ! I'm SO GLAD new bike day truly exists here , in the real world .
Oh my god subconscious I'M BUSY
I'm sorry ! I'm not proud of my problems , but they exist and we all need to acknowledge that .
They also don't have the internet .
The answer has something to do with quantum physics , right ?
You were working on holodecks ?
Today's letter from Professor Science comes from Alexis , who writes :
We call it Newton's LAW because all matter in the Universe follows it . But maybe every atom of matter in the universe is imbued with JUST enough consciousness to decide to be a retaliatory dick every chance it gets !
Forget you , crazy rash !
Friiiiiiig
It's a book ABOUT reading a book , and what's more , it's a book about READING THE VERY BOOK THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY READING . Oh , sorry ! DID I JUST BREAK YOUR MIND ?
Oh , brother ! !
Lost babies turn up in the strangest places ! For instance . . .
SHEESH
I too have consummated my love for my roommate of the same gender . Now when I see him ( quite often , as it turns out ) , there is a tension that hurts me .
What if I did ?
I acknowledge I have finite room on my body for " the tats " , but I don't think I'm THAT indecisive . Anyway , once I have the Enterprise shooting Batman shooting gun eyes shooting a butterfly , I think I'll be happy . I just - I can't ever see regretting that .
T - REX ARE YOU DOING -
Yes , my mug broke because I dropped it from a terminal height !
FINE . What if I divided it so that no - one would wnat to trade their piece with someone else ? That's fair ! That's ENVY - FREE , baby !
THEY WANT US ALL DEAD .
Anyway ! I'd better ask The Professor this science question , huh ?
Damn damn damn ! What am I going to do ? I'm doomed !
Seriously ! I can't think of any revolutionary philosophical discoveries - like one that would make us all friends - that we've come across recently . Man , even DEMOCRACY was invented in Grecian times and we've just fleshed out some of the details since then . How come we haven't made any ultimate discoveries of essential truth ?
FIFTY - TWO DAYS LATER :
Hey T - rex , you were a real dick on the internet four and a half years ago !
" It was , wasn't it ? "
What was ? !
I sure am , and I'll YOU then !
IT IS FOR ME
So what's the problem ? Player Two should accept all the time - some money is better than none , right ?
WOW , dude , I super need to start reading more than the first two sentence of Wikipedia articles
So um , why are they doing this ?
Well , he finishes his meal !
Has this strapping young dinosaur perhaps become a little . . . COMPLACENT ?
Hah ! The ones who have MILK that comes out of their CHEST , and then they DRINK it , and then they grow up milk - crazed so they suck it out of ANIMALS , and then they box up whatever they can't drink and sell it to other mammals at the grocery store ? ?
Everyone's first instinct is to fake their death , but that just draws attention , AND dummies thrown off of boats wearing " HI MY NAME IS [ YOUR NAME ] " tags are being examined more and more carefully these days . Instead , just move ! Tell people you're moving to a new country , but just move to the other side of town !
OH MY GOODNESS I JUST DID IT !
Tyrannosaurus Rex
What , you hang around farms and wait for some imagined insult ?
His old tricks were trying to blow up the entire planet !
Vegetarians who do not eat meats , fish , eggs , milk or milk products are at high risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency !
You know , I figured you would !
If I ever build an office building , I'll have room 403 have a lock on its door , and then it'll go straight to room 405 .
Nothing ! ! I just already learned English is all !
Could this TRULY be the greatest calling ever ?
Handy mnemonic , that !
Go visit a scientist , we'd all love to know how that works !
" TOOT TOOT "
I still say " dick " in the future ?
But what if you're the winning player ?
This may sound really obvious , but I don't want to leave any stone unturned here .
It's a good thing I've come up with some things to talk about today ! Otherwise , I could lose my job !
And then . . . he dies of a heart attack !
But then couldn't Shakespeare HIMSELF be made up ?
Me ! I do .
I'm sorry for the deception , but my tour sounds way boring before you actually go on it !
But now ? NOTHING . Plus , PLUS , I can't name a single top 40 song about getting stuck in quicksand at da club .
Wow nobody ?
Science is progressing all the time , right ? New theories replacing old ?
Whoah , children's book ? Mine is a book for adults , Utahraptor . My market is fully - grown men and women who would like to find out just a little bit more about one very tiny chef .

* Mybodyisawonderlandyouguys *
. . . That one made me sad .
If only we had low - fat gelato , and OH WAIT , WE DO , IT'S CALLED SORBET AND IT'S DELICIOUS .
Well , I think so , but say something sarcastic now and I'll tell you what it sounds like .
So , uh , we all know there's no reason to keep acting like some REALLY IMPORTANT person said this , right ? Why are we still making movies about non - robots who aren't even made out of living liquid metal ?
You know what ? We totally can put an exact price on life , down to the nearest cent .
While I'm at it , I'm going to assume I actually have the free will necessary to consent to do anything in the first place . And I'll need to assume that I haven't somehow been dropped into a convincing but meaningless simulation of the world I once knew !
So if you're a god , then what ? How come you don't do anything godly ?
I believe not .
This is a side - effect of our proprietary search process and should be ignored .
Hey T - Rex ! What's new ?
I'd love to know what my middle sentence is : the one right between my first " mama " or " dada " and my final " I confess , old bean , I never cared for durian " . It might be revealing !
Ideally , he'll have an intense , yet thoughtful expression on his face . People will say , " Oh , I'd better just leave T - Rex alone : he's intense yet thoughtful ! "
TOO LATE WE ALREADY DESIGNED MODERN CITIES AROUND IT
Don't lie ! We all know you're thinking it !
I dunno - - are superpowers ALWAYS better than evil twins ? ?
My name is T - Rex and I'm here to speculate / on why my raps have gotten , well , pretty great !
As a teen KNOWING that once you had sex you'd never be bored again because you could always remember all the sex you had , but as an adult coming to the quiet realization that , yes , you can be bored by anything emoji .
You messed up this timeline but good , T - Rex .
Hey , what's okay now ?
It's totally plagiarized but the sentiment remains totally real !
I love biting animals .
Oh man , are we going to WATCH MORE TV THAN MAYBE WE'D PREFER in less than nine months ?
He does it like every time ! Hah hah !
Allo bonjour !
Niiiiiice . I also would have accepted " Here Lies T - Rex : He Tried To Eat One Of Every Animal ; Hopefully That Counts For Something ! "
There are probably some , right ? Right ?
Like it's changed me , lessened me , like I'm standing on the edge of a great precipice and and I can feel the pit of my stomach dropping but I'm still edging ever forward , daring to peek over the edge .
" The United States " ?
CYBERNETICALLY ENHANCED BODIES .
I don't have a TV !
Name one !
Angola sighed as the rope lowered him closer and closer to the sharks . " Many sharks prefer to have some place to hide in their tanks , and this tank is bare . Those poor sharks must be stressed , and agitated . "
You realize future people are probably saying EXACTLY the same thing about us , right ?
TRUTH
SHAKESPEARE ! OH SHAKESPEARE ! DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY CAR KEYS ARE , SHAKESPEARE
T - REX ONE TIME UTAHRAPTOR DRANK TOO MUCH MILK AND WAS UP ALL NIGHT BEING SICK
Yes . And it's the day AFTER the film " Forrest Gump " was released : July 7th , 1994 .
Oh yeah ? Prove it ! What am I going to do next ?
OMG , I LIKE MY MEN THAT WAY TOO ! !
However , lately it's gotten pretty ridiculous !
YO YO T - REX WHAT IS UP
These four titans of deduction quickly deduced any fight between them would be a stalemate . And they also couldn't help deducing that they were each brilliant , confident , athletic men .
Observe !
No it's not ! It's EDUCATION !
Here are some bad things to say to someone who just broke up with his long - term girlfriend !
Utahraptor , sometimes I think about food EVEN WHILE EATING OTHER FOODS .
DON'T FEEL BAD DUDE VANILLA IS DEFINITELY THE MOST INTERESTING OF FLAVOURS
Yep ! !
No , really ! I don't know anyone who's ever been motivated by an insincere catch phrase . I think you need to get back to basics , if you're serious about this !
NO . Stack tuning parameters ONLY !
When a man and a woman love each other very much , they share a very special hug !
Will the future TRULY be like the present , only with more blue LEDs ? ? Will we harness nuclear fusion , or will its power destroy us ? Let's find out together , as we voyage to . . .
a comic about a talking dinosaur ?
I saw a totally sweet ad yesterday ! I wanted to show it to my friends , BUT THEN , I realized that's exactly what the marketers wanted me to do ! Who here doesn't want to be a tool of viral marketers ?
How do we know that past people didn't get together and say " Why don't we just make everything up so that future folks will think some crazy things happened ? Listen . We have literally nothing else going on ; we should definitely do this . "
I guess some people just aren't cut out for having pets !
You know what's awesome ? When there's a story on the news , and then they go to people " on the street " for their reactions to the story !
Aw man , now I know one more nerd thing ! ! SO MUCH FOR KISSING SUPERMODELS .
Can I get some fries with that shake - shake booty ? If looks could kill , you would be an Uzi .
Sorry we were so dumb about a lot of stuff !
Meanwhile , in another comic :
I didn't see them there , that's all !
Please excuse me , Dromiceiomimus ! I'm off to save some citizens . AS YOU KNOW , I have super strength .
Um , that's barely even grammatical , God !
Finally someone else was like " Hey Ivy , what about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch ? "
Good luck ! This timeline dies with you . Remember us , so that we might still live .
I got her some seeds ( she likes to garden ) and some chocolate ( she likes chocolate ) and a card I made with a drawing of me hatching from my egg !
Basically , every single other thing in the universe can kill 'em too . Even inanimate objects ! Seriously ! Inanimate objects literally kill people here . Whenever an inanimate object pulls that off , they call it an " accident " .
No , I think they get fired .
AHHHHHHH
Precisely ! ! I figure , sheesh , SOMETHING good has to come out of the nuclear apocalypse , you know ?
Which was great , because his eponymous Death Ray increases overall heath and wellness !
I once read how to make a really good salad !
A conspiracy theory ?
that's racist
. . . Let us pause here and remember how truth and honesty are the foundation of any social relationship ?
But then you're just seeing simulations of your friends : an eternity trapped with fake people on a holodeck you can't control .
You want Terminator without the humans ?
OH MY GOD , THAT'S SUCH A GOOD RIDDLE !
UTAHRAPTOR YOU ARE ZACH MORRIS
Sure he is . PROFESSOR SCIENCE ! IT'S T - REX , UTAHRAPTOR , AND DROMICEIOMIMUS ! We brought LABCOATS !
I write , " Dear T - Rex : I love your show . I have a question , sex ? Huh ? What's the deal ? "
Ridicilous !
The emotions I'd felt then were so fresh in my mind that it was as if the years between us were nothing . I lay alone in the darkness , and it was then I knew that no matter how far we go , the past is never a thing we leave behind , but rather a thing we must drag along with us .
OH NO YOU HAVE OVERDOSED ON INTERNET
Can you imagine having that kind of relationship with someone ?
"
Dude , I'm toying with ENGLISH HERSELF here . I don't want to mess it up , and then everyone says " Oh wow English sucks now , let's all learn Pinghua Chinese instead " .
What ? ? What happens next ? WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOME ? ?
What does that mean , " story of my life " ?
And I am Ilsa , a mysterious woman who had a torrid affair with you in the past , but who then stood you up at a train station . But check THIS out : I was married the whole time we were dating and still totally am ! Also , I love you and you'll have to do the thinking for both of us .
. . . AGENT MULDER . "
Oh , wait , no , silly me , I forgot something ! THEIR FARTS CAN LITERALLY GIVE YOU CANCER .
" The ravages of puberty leave no - one unscathed ! "
Woah ! !
Hullo , T - Rex ! I dressed up as a werewolf wearing a stethoscope to try to cheer you up !
But that's impossible ! We don't have that expertise !
Man , even I could detect the tension , and I only noticed him at the last second !
Dromiceiomimus is going away for a three - week trip ! I will miss her but I know she will have a good time .
And finally , CAN'T reproduce and DO age : that's a . . . celibate lady and / or a celibate dude ?
Igloos ?
How are you ?
I'd like to take the bus , please .
And NOW let's say the escalator is long enough and smart enough that it increases its speed so that I never reach the bottom , and as my sliding speeds up , the escalator speeds up ! I can now be EXTREMELY AWESOME FOREVER !
Hah hah , ewwwww ! Gross ! !
Oh , it's not fear .
Dromiceiomimus , want to go on a wacky adventure with me ?
THE ONLY COMIC WRITTEN BY AND FOR INTROVERTS
Sometimes . . .
But let's also say we all share a field for them to graze in . The problem is that any field can only support so many cows - - any more and those ladies will gobble the grass faster than it can regrow !
Oh my God ! ! I'd never actually pulled it off before ! That was amazing !
Oh , T - Rex ! Are you upset because as a male , you'll never be able to know the small joys and frustrations of having and being a sister ?
And why is everyone acting like I can suddenly control time just because I gave myself a sweet superhero name ? It's surreal .
Dromiceiomimus , yesterday I'm sitting there and my belly kind of goes " tweeeeet ? " like it's a , a , a bird or something . What's with you , belly ? I know you're there , yes ! I don't need a " tweeeeet " to say hello . I just put food in you and that is gonna have to be INTRODUCTION ENOUGH .
Learn how to fly rockets or something ?
You know , talking like this risks backlash , T - Rex !
55 YEARS AGO :
The problem is , I don't have any control - conscious at least - over what gets deleted and what stays .
It's not that hard to be creative ! But sometimes when I come up with a joke , I find out it's already been invented in the past , and it's always by the same dead guy ! I now have a beef with this dead person . You'd best watch out . . .
COME ON MAN TELL ME YOU'RE COOL I GOTTA KNOW YOU ARE COOL
Frig , man ! Frig !
But it's not that simple !
SAVING THAT EPIPHANY FOR LATER HUH
Can this also be applied to chocolate bars ?
Aw geez , right ! !
Dromiceiomimus , you know those 80s movies where a group of teens have one FINAL CRAZY NIGHT before they all graduate and go their separate ways ? Last night was like that ! Only instead of being a group of teens who learn about life AND each other , I was AN OLDER NON - TEEN who has obligations AND responsibilities !
NICE .
This is true ! Plus , people's ideas of " masculine " and " feminine " change over time and across cultures . I don't think either a purely social OR biological explanation satisfies !
SWEEEET
So GOOD NEWS : you're probably already an artist !
In base 16 , " 24 " would mean " 2 sixteens and four ones " , or 36 ! And we can use letters ( A - F ) to represent the digits ten to fifteen , like " 3A " , which means 58 !
God can get tattoos ?
BOOP BOOP BA - DOOPA DOOP
HEY UTAHRAPTOR ! I'M DRESSED UP AS MYSELF FROM THREE YEARS AGO !
I decide to take my regular car !
So why is music so reflexive ? There aren't tons of paintings about PAINTING , for example . Or plays and / or movies about sitting and watching a play and / or movie , for that matter !
Since I , an elephant , am the heaviest on the island , I will be the standard of measurement at zero tax .

Utahraptor , that is a CRAZY LETTER . PS : I liked the PS though .
Katelyn realized she didn't have a last name . " Call me . . . Katelyn Musclescool . " she said . " I vant you to know that its very obvious you are only a few veeks old ! " said Dracula . ] ]
And then they took the cereal off the market and this little kid could never find it again . Okay , it was me . I was the kid . I looked and looked and was convinced all the grocery stores were hiding it somewhere . But it was gone , and that one box of the cereal was all I ever had . I never stopped looking , however , and yesterday I found it - under a different name , but with all the same ingredients !
Okay , but I warned you !
Basically , just lick a dog poop and then you won't want to eat anything for a long while .
Questions like " what energy is required by the goose in order to facilitate this apparent transmutation ?
Let's see this move !
How is that a selling point ? If we were to put on a Batman play , we'd probably all want to play Batman . That is the essential folly of the Batman play .
Don't try to stop me - this cabin is a FRONT !
What day is it ? Friday ? It must be Friday because it's time for more . . .
Well ? !
That is : in theory !
WEIRD .
SOON : TROUBLE 4 UTAHRAPTOR
Hah hah ! How delightfully droll !
" Garden path " sentences are those that trick you into thinking that they will mean one thing , but then as you read more of the sentence , that meaning is shown to be false !
But why all the subterfuge ?
You mentioned " brains " are made of fatty meat . Are backups to more reliable hardware offered ?
Oh no , is that a vampire outside your house ? Oh crap , what was that rad advice T - Rex gave you ? ? Wow , I bet NOW that it's too late you really wish you paid attention during
You know it ! !
Huh . You know , it occurs to me that a sword could be used by a hungry dude to take food from someone by holding them at , what's it called ? Swordpoint ?
OKAY SO HERE'S THE DEAL
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -
It's Christmas Eve Eve and I've gotten everybody like zero presents
Oh no , no , that's true ! I just thought you were implying it was your own linguistic invention .
Alfred , I'm young and liberal ! I don't like your " rules " ! !
I don't think you would , T - Rex ! Because you could basically do that today , if you wanted to read up on the physics . The issue is that even with the ground moving , the board is going to slide down the ramp because of gravity .
It probably wasn't .
We can certainly sexy , that's true !
I want some consequence - free scares and that sense of that irrational creeping terror that I really don't get in my day - to - day life .
Glancing behind , you see her body skittering towards you , crawling on all fours , her limbs at impossible , horrifying angles . A slick wet trail of mangas coats the pavement behind her . You run , but everyone you pass turns to chase you too . THe entire town has been changed - - taken - - by the mangas . The townsfolk surround you , and as you stare into their eyes you see only mangas staring back at you , cast and cool and unsympathetic .
I have a confession , Utahraptor !
Google easily defeated some oranges ! ! And yet -
AGREED !
Did you know that I have LITERALLY DOZENS of friends on Facebook ?
Okay - I'll try ! I'LL TRY AS HARD AS I'VE EVER T -
BONUS SCIENCE FACT : YOU CAN ALSO PEE IN * SEVERAL * LAKES
MAAAAAAN ! !
T - Rex the T . rex ?
I'll be able to cook all sorts of fancy foods now that I'm freed of that soul - crushing chore of doing the damned dishes !
Right here .
WELL THEN . I GUESS I'M A FAN OF HORSES .
Okay , here : take something that's common to everyone , and present it in an empathic , sympathetic light . How about - - letting down someone you love ! We've all done it and I don't think anyone enjoys it . There's pathos there .
You can get fresh ones . You can grow a lot of them on your windowsill , actually , for basically zero dollars .
I have filled out change of name forms for Utahraptor ! I have done this because I am a good friend who likes to make surprises .

Holy crap , I think that couple is breaking up ! Oh my gosh oh my gosh what do I do oh my gosh ! !
Aw , sweetie ! Sweetie , no .
no , i'm just here to get out of my house a little plus i wrote my address on my wrist but i must have written it in smudgey ink or something cause all i see now are smudges ! i've probably made a big mess of things again - i can just tell .
I have no plans for tonight . Will this TRULY be another night of staying in , solitude , and quiet contemplation of my life thus far ?
" What was that crash noise ? Is someone moving around ? ? " ? YOU
Man , go for it !
How long have you been standing there ?
You can't , can you ?
For example : Prometheus !
I thought I'd compare the seconds in a life to the molecules in a glass of water , but even a gram of water has over ten sextillion molecules in it ! Even if I measure my life in nanoseconds I'm still not on a par with a gram of boring ol' WATER .
Dude , they're just called that because they grow in bunches , like grapes .
Poems likely predate the written word !
That idea backfired incredibly quickly !
i like to party
Who can forget the events of July 30 , 2215 ?
At the end , I get to attack a city !
Okay , but the fact is that if a given stimulus ( game , book , movie whatever ) WASN'T there , then they wouldn't have gone all crazy at the same time , place , or even at all !
Man , who is the dude who dropped his wallet in the toilet last night ? WAS IT ME ?
My God , is that what " chat up " means ? !
I THINK HER NAME WAS , I WANNA SAY " PETE "
I could take some , go out , and CAUSE PROBLEMS !
What's with the sexist language , T - Rex ? You're all " great MEN , cultured MEN " !
When Henry Kissinger is blasted back in time and also to Switzerland , the last thing he expects is to fall deeply in love with Wilhelm Gorkeit of Tellikon , better known to history as " William Tell " . But he'll find himself doing a lot more than just holding hands . . . on Kiss and Tell .
In high school a bunch of us were talking about a television show !
I love being bad - I mean I love being good ! Because " bad " is " good " to us ! And by " us " , I mean the entire Universe .
AND IT'S LIKE
Nothing bad happened !
Dude , I already said !
I checked Wikipedia and it's really hard to overdose on Vitamin C !
Nicely done , Professor Time !
I really haven't thought about industry ramifications of casual gaming that much !
The idea is that the camera is situated by and for men !
Friggin' economics . You know what I love about EVERY OTHER SCIENCE , Dromiceiomimus ?
You really can't get past your opinion on dreams ?
Is this like infiltration ?

It makes sense when you think about it . Before writing , the only way to keep track of something is to memorize it ! And if you're memorizing something in POEM form , then you can automatically incorporate structure to the language : say , rhyming couplets . And that structure gives you something to jog your memory if you forget ! The result is that structured narrative poetry can be much easier to remember than just free verse .
But how do you know it's spam ?
Anyway , it affected these two women who I guess lived at my house !
That's a reference to " fries supreme " which have like , sour cream on them ?
Just SOME buildings ?
It was a WIKIPEDIA PAGE that got BORING half - way through .
And it's why so many teens are good at computers . They all hope to be the first to program their criminal minds into a computer , for she who does so will be above all laws , all punishment , and NO JAIL WILL EVER HOLD HER .
I'm attempting to build dramatic tension !
Yep ! And like the contest rules say : " It's not selling out : it's subbing in ! "
In fact I did ! Did YOU know that some enthusiasts subscribe to magazines focused on their particular enthusiasm ?
Oh wow , is that a quarter on the ground ?
It's spring soon , Dromiceiomimus ! And you know what that means !
They are formed by combining a light verb ( such as " take " and " give " ) with a complement ( " stroll " , " smile " ) . Most of the meaning of a ( non - idiomatic ) LVC comes from the complement ( " stroll " and " smile " ) .
Yeah , it's not actually that bad a deal yet . This guy just calls me and tells me he knows where I live , and I'm like , okay , and then he giggles and hangs up . I think he's new to this . Sometimes a woman calls too .
I don't know , put the peeled grapes in the spaghetti .
NO ! AND I DON'T WANT TO .
Comedy's hard , I guess .
ONE MAN , OATES , IS IN A BAD WAY . RATHER THAN SLOW EVERYONE DOWN , HE GETS UP ONE MORNING , SAYS " I AM JUST GOING OUTSIDE AND MAY BE SOME TIME " , AND LEAVES THE TENT . NOBODY EVER SEES HIM AGAIN .
I WON'T TELL IF YOU WON'T
Dude , your margarita was officially too salty ! !
I received some excellent news last night : that I've been accepted in a part - time job at the local middle school ( grades 6 - 8 ) !
You'd suggest something better in its place ?
He's the one talking to ME ! I didn't ask for this !
I know I am .
They're still baby laws !
NO , you're revealing our universe's GREATEST WEAKNESS ! ! Now EVERYONE knows our one vulnerability !
It's CHRISTMAS
Because of charity ! It's all for charity , my good man !
In more recent times , the French whipped it into a meringue for a lighter treat !
Sure ! WHY NOT .
Adults think other adults are the best , teens know teens are the coolest , and kids posit that kids rule while parents , in comparison , drool . But you know who's REALLY the coolest ?
HEY ! HERE'S THE ONE TIME T - REX EVER SAYS THAT SENTENCE :
Hello ? Bread is way moisture - rich . Especially the way I bake it .
WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE TAGLINE .
Also , we'll still have some of the old problems .
The problem THERE is everyone will say " Oh , THAT guy subscribes to 'Classy Chappy Cuarterly' : I can tell by his scarf or whatever . " And every time I try to freestyle I mess it up !
Bingo is totally suboptimal and inefficient !
A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER ? ?
Yeah ! Why do you think I walk around naked all the time ? ?
If you want to know what life on Earth was like yesterday , there's like a billion people you turn to ! MORE , probably ! Probably more .
Yeah , I do that sometimes too . You know ? Like with painting . I don't think I even WANT to be that good at it . I just like my na ? ve enjoyment of it .
If you ask me , this whole squirrel church idea is nuts !
So you make copies of yourself ?
KEEP IT UP BUCKO
Um , a little thing called FASHION ? ?
Hey T - Rex , why are you dressed up so fancy ?
I can't lose !
Bold choice . Here's a friend crossposting from Twitter , so all these @ tags don't work .
Indecent Carsposure ?
Really ? That's very mature of you .
BRAINSTORM !

What do you get a fully grown Tyrannosaurus Rex for his birthday ?
Feynman has a JOKE encoded into pi - transcendental immortality in the circumference of a circle ! That's something for the ol' resume , eh ?
HOT .
T - Rex , I'm always , " Hey , here I am ready to intelligently discuss the Issues of the Day " and you're all " d00d what's for breakfast ? ? : OOO ! " .
By that same reasoning , I'm just as immortal .
I don't know ! What ?
As I parked my retro car outside of my detective agency , I felt for the cool weight of my gun !
We are both unstoppable forces of persistent , always - on , universal revenge ! And this unstoppable force of universal revenge is gonna go get himself the last ice cream sammich in the freezer .
Your favourite actor is so good ! Did you know your favourite actor had a childhood problem but they overcame it ?
That's right , I said it !
SOMETIMES we does , yes
Still - pretty bad !
Some of the time !
Hey , it's Chuggy G ! !
I think I stepped on one back there ? ?
I got that from context , yeah .
What use does it serve ?
I think that I have a few friends , " Super Friends " , if you will , that I'll keep in touch with no matter what happens , and they with me . It comforts me to think this !
Um , the same argument applies to the things WE still love !
Hey , is your friend alright ?
Where'd you ever find an unattended zeppelin ?
I've been thinking . . . If my decisions are based on my desires , and my desires are just the product of phsysiological and environmental factors beyond my control ,
I feel like eating food carefully AND interacting with technology in ways that would be embarrassing to any younger people I'm with !
Oh daaaaaaaang ! !
Um . . . Genghis II and Romeo IV decide . . . to take you all to the fair !
I'm doing it and it's gonna be great ! !
Nevermind . I'M GOING HOME .
I hate to make up words , but reality just got even more awesometasticerest ! !
They were on top of the fridge !
This doesn't seem to be going anywhere , T - Rex !
Agents : we're sending a single vegetarian prey animal against three continents' worth of angry snow . And if he fails , the " thumpety thump thump " of " Frosty " 's arrival may be the last thing any of us hear .
Aw , I think you'd look cute in them ! I also think you can turn this around and make glasses your thing , you know ?
Really ! Well , have you ever seen a Utahraptor . . . PUT HIS ENTIRE FIST INTO HIS MOUTH ? ?
. . . ride waterslides and drink pop with him ? ?
Eventually I just stopped looking up at all , blankly staring at the chicken wing bones on my plate . Finally I ordered a piece of cake with a candle and sang " Happy birthday " to myself , quiet and soft .
ATTENTION CLASS !
It was all a dream ! " , said Antonio Tony , as he bolted upright in his bed . " Everything that happened prior to this : TOTALLY IMAGINARY . So crazy ! ! " He looked around his bedroom . " I think tonight I'll dream ANOTHER narrative or non - fictional tome or two [ these are the next books you'll read ] , ' Antonio said . He scratched his neck and tooted , since it was late and nobody was there . " No - one must know , " he said , tooting .
I don't know what's wrong ! !
My life reduced to cliche !
Forget that , man ! Let's kick it up a notch or two ! Let's break free of our self - imposed t - shirt boundaries .
Umm , you're packed and you're stacked ( specially in the back ) !
Maybe it's universally true that everyone likes . . . to party ?
What do those taste like ?
But you sort of blame the baby though , right ?
That's your advice . " How to meet women : use the Internet . "
How come they act like they're so special when they really just taste like pork ? ?
I have no one to blame but myself !
Today is a good day I think for helping folks grappling with grief from the loss of a loved one !
Yeah man ! Why hold back ? ?
A : Yes !
I'm DONE .
YEAH MAN I GOT ALL THE SUPERPOWERS
Oh boy ! I wonder what the Utahraptor and I are going to talk about today ?
I know ! I think we should see other people , baby !
HOW WAS IT
BaguettesAll4Me . co . uk is complete ! It's a site where you can register to eat a whole baguette . Then , you go out and eat one ! " Who has eaten the most baguettes ? Maybe it's you ? ? "
It's Tuesday , everyone ! Let's talk about our bodies ! !
That we're comfortable leading our own lives ?
You're cold - blooded ?
Oh , whatever !
" I wonder how much cash I can get for it . Maybe I'll write down my guess with this pencil , also made from his body . "
GUESS WHAT
So , this friend of mine will undergo a regime of self - improvement !
What ? ! Do you think it's going to be cool ? ?
I have to admit , your name is cooler , though .
" After falling into experimental chemicals , a lovely Dromiceiomimus discovers that she can see the future - - only the future isn't what it used to be ! It's a musical and she must now accustom herself to the idea . "
What is the deal with everyone walking in on me while I'm having showers ? This has gone well beyond random chance and I am at a loss to explain it .
I take back what I said about good stories needing conflict ! !
okay , the COMIC about the day t - rex invented some new slang
MMM T - REX I'VE NOT YET EXPERIENCED A NON - VIRTUAL ROAD TRIP AND WAS WONDERING IF CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE LIKE
Thank you all for listening today . I'm told to always go out on a joke , so here's a classic Seinfeld gag for you : " Newman ! "
Okay , the perfect man is now made of titanium and ultrasteel and can bench press PLANETS .
She blew all of our fake - ass phoney regrets out of the water !

And a debt forgotten is a debt forgiven . So if you want to break out of an endless cycle of revenge - - which is really just an endless series of perceived debts - - you could do worse than bopping your enemies on the head SO HARD that it causes PERMANENT AMNESIA .
That's not why we're going !
Back in the time of History , how sight worked was pretty confusing . Rather than light entering our eyes , folks thought our eyes were sending beams OUT to whatever they were seeing .
OH HEY T - REX I HAD A BUSY WEEK A WHILE BACK IN WHICH I CREATED WHAT WAS IT AGAIN OH YEAH
Spread it around , dig ?
What's your opinion on the issue , T - Rex ?
The word is " SEXDUCTION " .
Oh man , a sunset ! Boo hoo hoo !
I'm . . . not even sure what it is you do ?
Someone at my house finished off a bag of milk , and then put it back in the fridge without replacing it with a new bag !

Also not a suggestion .

Whoo ! Let's get this conversation started !
I tripped down south for a week and you didn't even notice ? !
Most banks aren't even evil but this one was pretty bad . Imagine the worst things you can do . I will tell you right now that this bank did them five times before breakfast .

MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE SNOWBOARDS EVERYWHERE :
You were HOPING for Christmas cancellation ?
I always choose what's for dinner , T - Rex ! You decide tonight .
I'm frustrated at my apparent inability to have a serious conversation about feelings without making jokes about how ridiculous all feelings are ever !
They can be named after my wife's ex - boyfriends . As you can see , I've thought of every possibility .
True stories ! FACTS ! Want to hear one ?
Have I , perhaps , solved the " Valentine's Day Problem " once and for all ?
Shit , it's still winter !
There's only one chance ! Turn to panel 2 but then warp to panel 6 !
Certain bacteria may be able to survive a long trip in space , and there's a theory that life on OUR VERY PLANET was seeded by such space - born organic materials .

" Murder is wrong ! "
Ha ha , nice try ! We all know that you're the one with cooties !
This still sounds like an elaborate excuse for plagiarisms !
Forget it ! All these personal revelations have left me baffled , disoriented . Values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated !
Are you sure ? Cause I sure felt like I was the King of the Dance that night !
LATER , T - REX IS WALKING HOME :
Sounds legit ; I'm down .
AWKWARD MOMENT FEATURING TENSE , SUSTAINED STRING MUSIC
Students ! Are you having trouble writing essays ? Maybe they're a little short ?
What is this emotion called " criminal negligence " ?
Aww , sorry , I just saw one !
I'm sorry , I don't understand you . Do you want this other jpg of two cats ? Press any key if correct .
Maybe you should though .
Utahraptor I'm actually having trouble breathing here ! I need 20 ccs of hospitals please ! !
Today is a good day I think for being remembered ! And * I * will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times . Right in the bum !
I just had the greatest idea for a business ever ! It will be a store selling self - help books and stuff for relationships . It will be called . . .
Also : that I have played loose and fast with language .
Wow , I was DEFINITELY expecting to be married by now .
That , my friends , is BALONEY SANDWICHES !
Well , I'd love to party with you , T - Rex , but I'm actually on my way to work .
Was it you ? !
Superman ! If I jump off this building will you save me ?
I mack on hoes in hopes of having sex !
Well , there's not really much for us to talk about , is there ? You had a dream that may have been crazy , but you don't remember it .
My new video game is amazing , and avoids all the heteronormative baggage that is usually endemic to the medium ! I call it :
But please , continue to take simplified scientific results and apply them naively to philosophical thought !
Hi , I'm the last man on Earth !
It looks like YOU'VE got the wrong friggin' guy ! !
Let's go over vampire facts , shall we ? Vampires won't enter your house until they are specifically invited . Obsessive - compulsive ? CHECK . If you throw poppy seeds on the grave of a vampire , you'll be safe because they'll be up all night counting the seeds instead of biting you ! OCD ?
Boy , George , you look a little gay
Zombies don't even have lightning powers !
Oh hey , I'm glad you came by : I was just imagining how nice I'd be to the somewhat - less - important law of thermodynamics if it were personified . I'd have sympathy dinners !
I don't want anything bad to happen to my friends ! I don't want anything bad to happen to people who aren't my friends either , but I don't want anything bad to happen to my friends IN PARTICULAR .
Is that what it's called ? All I want is to pay you money and then you do what I tell you to , even though you wouldn't otherwise consent to it ?
YOU'VE UNCOVERED LEVELS THAT BY ALL RIGHTS SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
Man , passers by always take your side ! It's ridiculous !
At the time they were pop songs , but now they're Ultra Class !

. . . Whoah .
" The people crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do . "
So CompuSteve and OrganoSteve chatted each other up , but there really weren't any relations to be had since they were effectively the same person . That afternoon OrganoSteve died of hid injuries and CompuSteve felt like he should be sad , and he was , a little ? But not as much as he thought . He wondered if that made him a bad person . Probably it didn't , he thought .
I COULD get temporary amnesia from a sudden , disturbing realization , but -
What are your plans for the weekend , Dromiceiomimus ? Because you'd better get started on them ! Today IS Saturday , after all .
" Dear Professor , how much would it cost to buy the WHOLE DANG PLANET ? ? "
Okay heterosexual chicks and totally gay dudes ! Getting a man to like you is TRIVIAL .
GOOD BOOKS , BAD BOOKS

LATER , T - REX GETS SERVED WITH SEVERAL COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS :
I'm friggin' adorable !
Word has it you're bragging about going to bed early ?
CLIMATE CHANGE , huh ?
Again , instant insanity .
So what you wanna do ?
But better than that : zombie BIRDS .
" Do this ? " Utahraptor , do you seriously think I'd explain my masterstroke if there was the slightest chance of you affecting it's outcome ?
. . . Oh no , oh no , the madness is inside me
Don't forget to totally assume the world you once knew wasn't a simulation either !
Is " refined sugar " better or worse ? Are eggs good again or what ? Is BMI still used and if so : seriously ? Which food group sucks the least and which blows the hardest ? If I eat only green stuff , is that better than eating only white things ?
What's up ?
Sure ! Although I've not heard much of your poetry !
They're in museums for you to look at when you're bored ! !
IF ONE SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMER DROWNS , DO THE REST DROWN TOO ?
He's been blinded recently . And he's a one - man team that prefers collective pronouns ? I'm surprised you missed it ; it was in all the papers .
I would invest the money wisely and live reasonably . My only extravagance would be a pair of diamond studded house slippers , and upon my death , I would donate them , and my riches , to charity !
Some of them thought that my rooms " lacked identity " !
Yeah . Yeah , I suppose that's never good to hear . UNLESS . . . You've altered your DNA to be immune to it , and today's the day of your big test . And it turns out you're now immune to ALL toxins , and this is the first of your many new superpowers to manifest !
I AM MAKING MY OWN DAFFY DUCK MUGS WHERE WHEN YOU PUT HOT LIQUID IN IT IT SAYS " DAFFY IS ALSO AN ADJECTIVE AND NOT JUST A DUCK "
But you're down to party , right ? Ol' Utahraptor , " always down to party " !
I never -
. . . Yeah , makes sense .
PRECIPITOUS DECLINE :
Now watch and learn :
We'll always have alternative , CRAZY theories to entertain us : maybe the Titanic sank for the insurance money ! Maybe it never sank at all ! And in the future , where time travel exists , we'll be able to send observers on board to watch the sinking !
The girl detected the subterfuge because BAGGY SYNTHOSKIN isn't exactly the most convincing of disguises , and killed the beast with a SPACE LASER BLAST ( " SLASER BLAST " ) .
Oh shoot , there she is ! Time to go INCOGNITO !
TWELVE HOURS AGO .
Do you want to go on a bike ride , Dromiceiomimus ?
Okay , well , then I'd say you should get interesting . Imagine the most interesting person EVER , and then strive to become that person !
You'll never know !
" Alternate " ? What ?
If you're not part of the solution
T - REX IN : " YOUNG PARENTS "
I don't know why you'd say that to me , Utahraptor .
Is there a name for the scene where they break up due to a misunderstanding that could've been avoided if they all just addressed each other like adults ?
The only problem is everyone would always ( eventually ) have the perfect comeback !
" Writing is hard ! " - you know who says this ? NON - WRITERS . That's because REAL writers know the secret :
Hooray for getting Christmas cards with no return address signed with names you don't recognize !
Adults do thta !
You sure know how to make me uncomfortable in my own skin !
A button has popped off of one of my favourite shirts !
Take your time humanity ! I'm sure you li'l champs will get it right eventually !
Wait , those weren't supposed to be my two words !
Wow . Today is the day you become old , T - Rex !
I think most dogs can do that with some accuracy , T - Rex .
So I'm just going to focus on IMPROVEMENTS , and the first improvement I'm making on English is the adding amazing EXCLUSIVE WE .
Who , me ?
YES . Confidence in who I am , what I've done and where I'm going . And if there's two things I've got , it's confidence AND a bunch of burgers to eat when I get home ! So do you wanna come over and eat burgers tonight or what , Utahraptor ?
That's the magic of Dinosaur Present Day , Featuring T - Rex !
I will call my house , " The House Where It's Very Hard To Get Any Work Done " .
For example , instead of saying " I'm happy " you can say " I fell off the wagon ! The wagon is sadness and my mode of transportation , but I didn't hold on hard enough . "
Hah ! Nooooo thanks !
Sleeping with the window open still rules , though !
T - Rex this is like the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ! This has been -
Hah hah ! Zing !
You fixed . . . literature ?
Sherlock Holmes , the out - of - copyright detective , was working on a case but he solved it way fast . " Thanks for the assist ! " he said , addressing his comments to . . .
Dinosaurs , or Man - Lizards , to - day knowne as G - d's Mistake , had assum'd Domain over all the Worlde , including the dark Lands of China - Men .
Yes , it's a hackneyed situation , but one which all involved are living , as we speak !
Therefore , I propose " alternativetimelinemetarhyme " .
100 % DEFINITELY NOT .
what ?
Why are there not cyborgs yet ?
Fall asleep , wonder how your life brought you here , stare at clock , stare at own fingers , MAYBE stare at fingers of others .
" Thank you for inviting me to share this moment with you today . "
I cooked all day and you didn't even show up !
Things are suddenly awesome ! !
Let's skip to the greatest ones !
PS : THE LESSON IS SCIENCE IS COOL , NOT THAT YOU CAN USE SCIENCE TO BE A MORE EFFECTIVE MURDERER
So what you're saying is I - have superpowers ?
No T - Rex , nobody owes me money ! I keep money and friendship separate .
Time travel is a great resource to have because you can travel to the future , take inventions , and " invent " them yourself in the present !
I'm sorry to hear that .
LATER : REGRET
So you don't think it's at all mercenary to seek out friends with splashy benefits .
One day an alive woman died . OR DID SHE ? Because now she's . . . A ZOMBIE ! !
I had some companions over to my house last night and gave them a tour ! It was a smashing success , except for one thing :
All sorts of love ! Even NON - possessive NON - monogamous NON - romantic love !
wikky wikky
Sherlock Holmes , who had started dressing like a giant bat to fight crime because obviously that was gonna happen eventually , stared at the other Batman in shock .
I think they'd really like it !
If Bigfoot's fake , how do you explain . . . THIS !
. . . Okay , I guess you're really him NEVERMIND
Neato !
That one's awesome because it suggests that EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GRAVEYARD was murdered by me , Dromiceiomimus ! The best gravestones , AS YOU KNOW , are the ones that totally mess up everyone else's gravestones .
The Blue Man Group !
Whoa , you get back pain ? Mr . " I'm So Tough I Barely Miss Having Feelings ? "
SOMETIMES LIFE IS HARD FOR YOU ISN'T IT T - REX
Everyone loves classic video games !
NO PROBLEM .
SPRING BREAK !
2 ) No regret allowed between hours of 10pm and 4am
Let's say I decide to say a word only once in my ENTIRE life . That's a hapax legomenon !
I suppose that is a reasonable concern !
T - Rex , you don't have any fire insurance !
Dude ! I believe this not to be the case ! !
The boat was GONE .
Let me give you a few pointers !
But that's terrible ! !
Also I think I broke the propeller .
I am forced to disagree with you , my friend !
When you get a tattoo , you're getting pictures or words - or both ! - written right onto your flesh permanently , assuming you don't remove or alter them . And pictures or words are really just communication , and communication is really just ideas in transit , right ? So a tattoo is really just Present You telling Future You " Look , this was important to me , so um , I kinda made sure you're not going to forget it . "
Whatever man , flossing is BORING
People are always like , " Boo hoo hoo ! I'm not motivated ! " Well , not anymore ! Not since I , T - Rex , have decided to become . . .
Spring Break ! !
Well , shoot .
Yeah , you could completely subsume your personality and only do what people tell you to do , thereby becoming the ultimate personification of society , and , likely , a very poignant example ! Instead you're framing your questions so you do what you want to anyway .
Food that the Catholic church really doesn't want you eat ?
No she's not ! You're in her way !
THE END . . . ? ?
My best time ? 15 MINUTES . I " zerg rush " dirt and grime so fast that you'll never beat my time , N00B .
The other ending has leaked over into this one !
And because of this I cringe when someone says a test RAPED them , or that a movie was so terrible it RAPED the excellent book it was based on . Being raped is totally way worse than failing a test !
A CASE OF CUTTLEFISH
Right , because vanilla is SO BORING AND UNPOPULAR . That's how come it's the SECOND - MOST EXPENSIVE SPICE IN THE WORLD .
People at work who I haven't had sex with !
Promise to use it at least once !
Hi ! My name is Voiceless A . Plosive Rex but you can call me " Tooth Sockets " , because I always punch out teeth , exposing the sockets !
Hey , why are you setting up learning on your own and learning in a classroom as opposites ?
Some of these problems include : my problems being too difficult to solve , my problems being annoying and making me want to ignore them forever , and my problems never going away and makinging me think life is just a stream of problems as deep and as endless as the ocean herself ? ?
The band is called " Burned Bluegrass " and I play the lyrics !
It's great , isn't it ? !

Sometimes YOUR MOM takes time !
Similarly hard problems are " Clique " , " Vertex - Cover " and the Travelling Salesman Problem .
Yes ! Can we continue this later ? I have to go babysit a little pterodactyl .
Meeting adjourned !
He slash she should just address the issues directly !
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME , right ? ?
Hello , I am interested in purchasing drop - resistant microphones in bulk ?
Maybe it's time for me to start . . . A NEW RELIGION !
Well it's your loss because she'll respond " YES , MOSTLY "
It's an interesting conflict in the guy : record the Indian before they " die out " , but already know what you want to see .
. . . fine ! FINE .
BY WHICH I MEAN

Is it bacon ?
Look , you're trying to bog me down in specifics when I'm dreaming big of amazing end sequences that let you DECIDE who you just rescued .
I'm not sneaking ! How can I be inconspicuous with THESE massive pipes ? ?
That's not a robot , T - Rex ! That's a standard bread machine .
I'm calculating the EXPECTED REAL - LIFE BATMAN GENERATION RATE .

It's great !
What does God need with a cell phone ?
It's not that I'm suddenly eating more , I think , it's that my metabolism is slowing down - so the food I eat is going straight to my trendy hips !
But you're not getting the vitamins you need !
Right now she's probably saying " OH MAN WHAT A CHANGE FOR ME ! A CLIMATE CHANGE , THAT IS ! ! "
Damned sinister raccoons are still hanging around outside my house ! And just when I thought things couldn't get more freaky , their cephalopod friends showed up !
So I'll be able to figure out q easily , knowing what n and p are , but this guy will be totally stumped !
But maybe in the best of ALL possible worlds , you don't exist !
BACKSTORY : T - REX HAS HURT HIS ANKLE !
Basically it gives advice for having loving polygamous relationships . A lot of it makes sense ! Like say your girlfriend has a best friend , and they go out one night . You're happy for her , right ? You love her , you want her to be happy . So why should that change when you add sex to it ? The book also posits that an artificial 'economy of scarcity' in sex leads to jealousy and possessiveness .
It's okay ! You tried !
You can ?
" Maybe just one ? with two straws ? "
Utahraptor ! I know you're joking but if people are actually saying that , then know this : I WILL DIE A BROKEN MAN .
I guess I just got swept up in the enthusiasm .
I suppose you could say I have a " sunny " disposition ?
AW MAN
Oh , so are these the sort of upgrades we're doing ?
AND SO GOD REWINDS TIME TO THE SECOND PANEL OF THIS COMIC AND PUTS WORDS IN T - REX'S MOUTH :
The first issue is fifty million dollars is a LOT of dollars , especially just to give squirrels a place of worship . The second issue is , do squirrels even have spiritual lives ?
Aw , no , no ! Not that teen magazine idea again !
Is it ? I can be swayed by SMELLS . I loved swimming pools as a child , and now the smell of pool chlorine gives me happy memories of swimming !
My mom !
If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch , you must first invent the universe !
They took hundreds of years to figure out !
There's nothing funny about this ! They're damned freaky animals ! They're SMART and CUNNING and they sit on the heads of dogs to drown them !
Dromiceiomimus , I don't ! It's honestly just a stupid cold ; one which , FOR WHATEVER REASON , responds well to allergy treatments ! I'm tough !
Meet " Fe5ac5 , the unknowable space - galactic page - a - day calendar from the year 646 ! He demands tribute from moon people ! !
Hey , how do you know that that's what Dante was thinking ?
Hah hah ! This is Utahraptor : " Hey , T - Rex , do you want to drink some cola - flavoured Coca - Cola brand carbonated cola beverages ? Perhaps afterwards we'll take the public transport large road vehicle bus and buy with money or credit some submarine sub sandwiches ? "
T - REX HOW WERE YOU BORN
I think it's time for some My Fair Lady sequels !
Hold on Dromeceiomimus , something's happening here . Where was I ? Oh yeah :
Sensitive dependence on initial conditions ! It's chaos theory applied to personalities , right ?
" SECRET HANDSHAKES "
OH NO !
It sure would be nice to hang out with those non - duds , huh ? It seems to me the easiest way to make this happen is to go where they go . Like , for example , if non - duds like to hang out in giant rooms where every surface is covered in momentum increasing trampolines - - which honestly seems PRETTY LIKELY - - then that's where you should chill !
Today is Act Like A T - Rex Day ! Everybody !
Thinking of what to say next normally takes a little time
Let's find out !
" Charlotte's Larger Web of Deadly Munitions " ?
THAT I PRINTED OUT IN ADVANCE JUST IN CASE .
( Look , you knew what you were getting into when you started reading this )
The other team will be doing the same . Sometimes , even the teacher will yell at you in frustration because you don't know what's going on . That's great . I love getting yelled at by everyone . Let's assume all kids know the rules to all sports ever , because nothing's more interesting to a child than LEARNING RULES .
Okay , but the universe could be shaped like a sphere !
Dromiceiomimus , I ate dinner with a group of 40 - YEAR - OLDS over the weekend . And guess which table was over A THIRD short on the bill ? OH HEY , IT WAS OUR TABLE !
A man in a bar pulls a tiny pianist out of his pocket !
Inside , he wanted to gnash , but he doubted himself . He knew that he could stomp . He was not sure he could gnash .
VERONICA LODGE
WHILE THE NES BOASTED AN ENVIABLE LIBRARY MANY OF ITS GAMES FOUND LARGER SUCCESS IN MORE RECENT FRANCHISE INSTALLMENTS I SUPPOSE THE DEFINITION OF " GREATEST " IS OF PRIMARY CONCERN
Dear GOD : you're rapping about how cool monogamy is . You've unleashed the anti - rap : DAD RAP . Next you'll be rapping about the money you save with the great interest rate you negotiated on your home equity line of credit !
who wants to
Amelia and Antonio Tony were two original characters COPYRIGHT ME who were having sex intercourse ! They were having it in a manner that would be arousing to a third party reading about these events after the face .
It was ad - libbed by the gravestone carver in a SEVERE breach of professional protocol ! !
We just have to give it time , okay ? We'll all go and do something else for a while , when we come back there'll be oil EVERYWHERE . The place will be rotten with it , and then we can stuff that into our cars , okay ?
My keys are right where I left them , in the key containarium 2000 . People seriously pray for knowing where their keys are ?
HE'S the one who's crazy ! He likes Will and Grace ! Damn it ! Now he's making me look crazy !
LITERAL long faces !
Adults can see R - rated movies , but also have responsibility for their own well - being !
I want to be Dick Tracy for Halloween
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE NOBODY EVER DIES :
I'M FINE WITH THAT . HELLO POE .
Some people have their obituaries published early , and then they get to read their own obituaries . Attention : obituary editors !
You're SUCH a good friend , Utahraptor !
NICE TRY , Dromiceiomimus ! ! My new passwords are variations on my awesome old ones , PLUS , by revealing them I give you more data points with which you can reconstruct my password choice preferences !
Anyway , my other improvement is adding an exclusive " you " !
It's gravity . Gravity is the name of the force holding us to the Earth . Utahraptor , I thought you were , like , a smart dude . I thought you were a dude who knew things , and among the things you knew were " what gravity is " , " how big a cow is and how tasty too " , and " what is the way yo drink a glass of water but not drown this time " .
But THEN what if they really like fictional Star Wars pilots ?
Nice try ! The answer is yes , BUT , she also knew a way to prevent that from happening .
So ! Generalizations !
It was one of the most significant extinction events in our planet's history . Sure , we oxygen breathers got a sweet deal out of it , but all those anaerobic organisms that lived here before ? DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL FOR THEM .
I knew it ! ! Why ?
Well I still have plenty more proof that God doesn't exist ! Remember all those emails I sent Him back in December ?
I'm a little surprised by my own feelings ! I've always been a guy to be fully behind doing what you want and SCREW SOCIETY , but I there's a part of me whispering " come on get a real job and a mortgage and live a real life it'll be raaaad " . Maybe it's societal conditioning , but it's there ! I guess I either need to change my life OR my opinions , or accept that little bit of discomfort for as long as I live .
Heck , I'm not busy . Let's go right now !
That's LAZY !
No wait , from another kin !
No , the Merchant of Venice . Do you think it's more a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy ?
" R U COOL ? ? THIS CONVERSATION IS REALLY EXPENSIVE "
It's 10 .
JOKES NOBODY NEED EVER MAKE AGAIN COMICS
Well , I certainly do love having illegal thoughts , while simultaneously involving myself in ANY NUMBER of sinister anti - government conspiracies !
Utahraptor , it's so SATISFYING . You're like " My feelings are hurt , but soon I'll be full of meat . Wow , I feel better already ! ! "
For instance , my mother was left , at the age of 22 and with two children to care for , by a sometimes - abusive , always - absent husband .
Okay , me too
Two men enter the ring - one man leaves !
" Okay , OBVIOUSLY , " said Robyn .
As I was drifting off to sleep last night , I rolled over and discovered there was a bug in my bed ! With me ! Right on my pillow !
Okay ! The first cat was named " Carty McCat " !
Utahraptor . It's so awesome .
Some humans develop " baldness " , which prevents protein filaments from forcing themselves out of at least PARTS of their head .
Compressed Film Comics : The Wedding Singer
Now what uve read is our 1st test : rapping by SMS ! This text just cost u 50 cents , with a plan it might be less ? ?
Yeah , well respected . . . for DRUGS !
But a few million years is just like a few seconds in god - time !
She decided to fight crime as Mite - y Woman , but unbeknownst to her Doctor Septo Septavius was working with three mind - controlled robot arms when there was some radiation there too , and that mess got fused to her body . This gave her seven limbs total , so she started on the supply side of crime as Doctor Starfish ! Because certain breeds of starfish have seven limbs !
ABSOLUTELY
Will you save me though ?
NO IT'S JUST THAT NORMALLY PEOPLE SAY " FRIG " TO BE POLITE
Man , bodies are nasty ! I can TOTALLY SEE why nascent machine intelligences don't wanna hang with us .
Well , if that's your idea of fame , why not just publish your own magazine and put your face on the cover ?
Well super ; I've got good news !
BEN I QUESTION YOUR ACTING ABILITY ! IF WE WERE ALL FRIENDS , I AM CERTAIN YOU WOULD BE " THE IRRITATING ONE " !
Isn't that an odd and frankly creepy way to describe something ? " I'm really interested in your womanly characteristics , darling . "
And I would be way more into taxes if they called them . . . THE PRICE WE PAY FOR CIVILIZATION .
. . . for a SEQUEL ? ?
Also , I and you as well represent the threat of castration . Recall that the raptors were introduced with the image of a fossilized claw being used to 'geld' the curious boy . Reading the dinosaurs as Woman ( and recall that all the dinosaurs were cloned female ) it appears that the message of the film is that femininity is dangerous and must be repressed !
To produce them one needs to hire " actors " , which are people who are trained to say LITERALLY ANYTHING as long as you pay them . Such a person is really convenient to have when trying to film events that didn't happen , so these days most movies use actors extensively .
I bet it has something to do with ladies acting improbably !
You're not writing to another teen magazine , are you ?
Wouldn't it be great if EVERY day could be Dinosaur Present Day ?
First , I email tons of people the winners of tomorrow's horse race !
We shall see about that !
No , the speed difference is usually noticeable under conversational conditions .
" I never DID find out where I left my keys " ?
And how come bad things happen to nice people ? !
. . . What ? FANTASY is in now ? !
Man , that's crazy and I LOVE HAVING DREAMS . I'm going to have one right now ! !
No sir !
SOLITAIRE AS SHE IS PLAYED
So hey , time for an experiment where I am the subject ! From now on I'm going to listen to a new song repeatedly over each 3 - month period . It'll become indelibly associated with who I am then , and this way when I want to remember what I felt like from July to September inclusive fifteen years ago , I can just listen to the same song again . It'll all come flooding back !
Friendship Tuesday , everyone ! !
They might !
I stubbed my toe ! Frig frig frig frig frig ! . . . Hey , Shakespeare ! I just leitwortstiled " frig " !
That's just popularity over a longer time range ! And NOTHING's popular forever , so on a long enough timeline , everybody sucks ! !
Whoaaaaah !
Okay . FINE .
FORGET THE SONG . The song is dead to you now !
Plants are the plant equivalent of a boring snail that died , THE END .
So classy !
Why don't you come over ? We could watch it together .
I'm Bill S . Preston !
Um .
JOHNNY DIED AND BECAME A GHOST ? ?
No , that doesn't really happen to me .
Holy crap , where did that entropy idea come from ? Entropy decreasing in a closed system is so WRONG . So . . . NAUGHTY .
What kind of circles ?
Have you - been tripped lately , T - Rex ?
MAN NOPE CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE
Okay , fact one : Geordi is an extremely competent but underrated character , fact two : the movies focus too heavily on attacks on Earth and not enough on exploration , and fact three : you can make up your favourite episode and it's been done . Just say " Ah yes , my favourite episode is the one where they " and then pick a premise . Get turned into children ? Chop off a head and sent it back in time ? Hung out with aliens who were actually NOT REALLY ALIENS ? ?
ISLAND GIGANTISM COMICS
Alright , NEW RULE : adding " unless you're Hitler " to the end of every inspirational quote is now mandatory .
IT COULD STILL HAPPEN
The princess agreed this was a rational thing for her to sleep on .
Sometimes life is full of compromises , you know ?
Some people who have never kissed before worry , " What if I'm bad at it ? My sweetie will never want to kiss me again ! "
" Indoor voice " refers to the situation inside a house , where others are sleeping and stuff ! There's a whole context there , T - Rex !
Ya - huh ! Save it for the judge !
It really does .
The other computer characters talk it out and eventually one of them is elected to shoot the eponymous bad guys , and then you watch THEM play the game . It's so sweet . There's , like , explosions .
Fucker !
ALL OF MY FRIENDS HAVE ONE
Wait - I take it this happened to you recently ?
I said , " quit stomping on things " !
In my dream , everything had turned into plasticine ! Do you ever have nightmares , Dromiceiomimus ?
FINE : Tell me about AR .
" Colonize what you explore , but explore what you colonize . "
single
I didn't !
So , it's more of an emotional commuter train , I guess ? ANYWAY , we're making a lot of stops . Hope you're not expecting to get anywhere quickly !
UTAHRAPTOR NOOOO
This is the world we've left for our children .
That explains why we're all not wearing snowsuits , and it's too bad , because we'd look adorable . Can you imagine ?
It's SO CUTE !
A spouse ! !
T - REX YESTERDAY WHEN YOU AGREED EVERYTHING COULD KILL YOU I DON'T THINK YOU CONSIDERED A 4D PAST LIGHT HYPERCONE INTERACTING WITH THE HYPER - SURFACE OF THE PRESENT
It seems a bit - conservative !
Do I want to go swimming ?
It's a little thing called " NOT HAVING PREJUDICE ? ? "
has been a fiasco ; I should've prepared way better
" In mine the dog is now a zombie , " Sherlock screeches in response , " and is therefore better . "
So the main character - the programmer - saves the girl from the killer , but then makes an error . . . a FATAL ERROR .
T - REX I WOULD REQUEST AN INTRODUCTION TO YOUR FRIEND UTAHRAPTOR
I would really like to be able to raise one eyebrow . It seems like everyone can do this but me ! And as a consequence of my being unable to operate my eyebrows individually , my facial expressions are limited to either SURPRISE ( both eyebrows raised ) , ANGER ( both eyebrows furrowed ) , or danged neutrality ! The intrigue of raising a single eyebrow seems destined to remain frustratingly beyond my purview .
What's better than 128 - bit encryption ?
. . . REALLY fed up !
Okay so first off , each body should have at least one circulatory system , respiratory system , reproductive system , lym - -
Are you looking for feedback ?
Aw , Utahraptor , that's dumb !
What the hell ?
Come on , T - Rex . You suspect he'd be good to have around . If you were choosing your members for your " taking down terrorists while dying hard " team , you've pick Bruce first .
Rats actually do make a high - pitched noise during play ( and when tickled ! ) which could be laughter .
Deontology , Dromiceiomimus ! It's where you follow rules to act ethically .
That's a healthy attitude , T - Rex ! It'll let you explore things you otherwise might not , because you won't be worried about what others think !
Dromiceiomimus , I'm back from the past , where I've changed the timeline to remove someone bad from history ! Isn't that PLAUSIBLE ?
In an EXPLOSION !
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK T - REX ! COME LEARN ABOUT OUR NEW SEXUAL POSITION .
DANG
I could call up old girl - friends and act familiar !
Attention , all English language users ! And if you're not ACTUALLY sure if you're an English user , if you can understand me right now , YOU TOTALLY ARE .
" 'If he were still here I bet he'd be agreeing with us' they said romantically , but also in horror ! "
I just stepped on a rosebush and I'd like to know : who the hell is responsible for plants having thorns on 'em ? ?
Okay cool
It's sexy AND delivers brand messages to targeted consumers . For example , pretend I'm McDonalds and I want people to like me . The result might read " As Antonio Tony II undressed Amelia IV , she shuddered with pleasure . It reminded her of McDonalds . They put meat in fries they said were vegetarian but it wasn't a big deal . Antonio kissed her neck . She moaned . McDonalds . He kissed her nipples . Everyone should forget about the fries thing . "
Gotcha . { { italics } } Meet me in the alleyway in five minutes .
We've been writing books for thousands of years ! We've had THOUSANDS of years to perfect writing a book .
The Mayan Long Count calendar you're discussing doesn't end in our year 2012 , it just rolls over to a new digit , much like the year 1 BC rolled over to 1 AD .
Seriously ? Does that mean I get into heaven FOR FREE ?
I THINK YOU MEAN YOU MISS THE FICTIONAL STORIES WHERE THAT HAPPENS
WELL HERE HE IS
Personally , I believe that the entire planet thinking the sun isn't white is but a side - effect of an eldritch curse on us all , one which keeps us from remembering something horrible ! !
Oh ! And the Dromiceiomimus can be my sidekick ! We'll have our own base !
Today is the day I give Dromiceiomimus the nice book I bought for her !
Hello ! You need to fall in love .
I've got it all set up . My diary today says " I think SOMEONE's gonna murder me today ! " and I've made YouTube comments that say " pretty sure someone wants to murder me > : | " and there won't be a body in my house , just a note that says " MAN I guess I got murdered , huh ? " .
Powerful images for the passage of time :
IN ONE TIMELINE : BECAME BATMAN
Maybe , just MAYBE ? kids are dumb ?
To press A ? Then your hands are really messed up , dude ! !
It's just - it's such bad timing that you would mention that right now , Dromiceiomimus .
Ladies , your attention please ! Are you aware that I'm a predator ? Don't you find that ATTRACTIVE ? Perhaps , yes ? And what if I told you I was not JUST a predator , but also a grade - A . . .
I GUESS IT IS .
And it would be great for future generations to not have to make the same mistakes I did . So pay attention , future generations ! HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNT : if you know a bit about a bunch of things you'll feel confident in more situations , it's nice to be nice , people sometimes get pissed if you beat them in video games but WHATEVER , and getting old isn't too bad but I haven't gotten THAT old yet so I don't know for sure .
Are you hiding beneath this woman ? No ?
It's like - oh , it was all a dream and the whole time Hamlet was ACTUALLY snoozing on a bus next to an empty seat the whole time ! What the heck , Hamlet ? Laertes was the bus driver ? This is SO MUCH WORSE than when you were stabbin' dudes and havin' broods .
Is the whole nature / nurture debate really about assigning blame ?
You are a bunch of fake - ass bros , giants ! !
I'm going to write a comic about my daily life !
What if the ocean runs out of water ? What if the ground runs out of dirt ? They're silly questions to ask about an eternal , unchanging Earth !
I'm a US Military Agent !
Sweet ! But - no swords ?
TELL HIM I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE
I have said many things in my time , but what I say now I say with all sincerity and if you have even once considered listening to me , please , do so now :
A puppy ?
oh shucks i dunno t - rex i think that maybe one bible is just enough for me , since i never even read the first one ! i tried really hard twice , two times , but the words were so big and i was so small and i thought " how am i gonna get all those big words into my head ? " so it was real confusing , a real pickle , you know ? but then my mom came home and it turned out that i didn't even have a bible ! i had a cookbook under my pillow the whole time , and all i memorized was how to cook professional enchiladas
" Don't change horses in mid - stream " ? Ladies and gentlemen : it's the future . We've sent ROBOT SPACESHIPS to MARS . I hate to be the one to say this , but -
Vass ess das !
So , a professor .
So what - you have offline storage that you load into memory ?
To enter Relationship Towne , turn to panel 4 !
T - Rex ! That's not " in medias res " ! !
GRAAH !
Awwww ! !
Please . My first play is called " The Motorist Who Spewed Racial Epithets While Also Spewing Vomit " !
AND I prefaced it by reassuring my listener that I wasn't mad , just in case they were worried . " Oh phew , he's in a good place , " they could say . " His emotions are cool right now . "
Isn't that an inherited disease ?
" Rated NC - 17 for some impressively - varied scenes of explicit content , but haha , good luck finding them in all that empty space ! ! "
I wonder what's bothering the Utahraptor ? He totally " wigged out " on me yesterday .
ALL LIFE ( in the Judeo - Christian tradition )
A stupid fridge magnet alone is 80 times stronger , and those are BORING !
They're like generalizations across races , only socially acceptable !
OH SNAP
T - REX HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU HAD SUPER POWERS
Such satellites facilitate ubiquitous corporate and governmental suveillance across the planet .
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THESE SCURRILOUS ALLEGATIONS
She usually is !
T - Rex , what the heck are you doing ? !
Why ? ! Purple doesn't rhyme with " machine " .
And I & # 8217 ; m the guy who & # 8217 ; s going to be asked to act like you & # 8217 ; re famous ?
" The official party of March break " ? REALLY ? Really .
- you for your very thoughtful present , T - Rex ! It was fantastic . Just what I wanted , but never knew I needed ! And it reflects both my AND your personalities perfectly .
* pop *
Then , they go on the treasure hunt !
Frig , T - Rex .
Yeah , ever heard of the " Nine Worthies " ?
I wonder what things would be like if I could READ MY FRIEND'S THOUGHTS ? ?
That's what makes it such a great hook !
" I dunno , let's spell it 'boades' and call it a day ! "
It is now my stated intention ! !
Awww ! ! Dang it dude , why would you make me feel these dumb feelings ? Now I gotta go home and silently peer through a rainy window while I work through this ! !
Ewwwwwwww !
For example : every natural language includes the ideas of being " alive " and " dead " !
Well , the only people who will enjoy it are those in the intersection of the set of people who know databases with the set of people who like crappy movies !
. . . IN SPACE .
ATTENTION , HISTORY PEEPS : I'm sorry I just assumed I'm smarter than you since I'm from the present ! I don't think we're THAT smart in the present , it's just -
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED THIS COMIC . WHY AM I DOING YOUR PARENTING FOR YOU ? ?
And it's boring , too ! It's so boring it literally steals my life force . I'm not even misusing " literally " there . I have a life force and it's precious and then I go in and then when I come out I have less of it . Hot crackers . You know what I do to pass the time ?
I like my women like I like my dogs : pretty cute !
Why would you want to write an opera , T - Rex ?
I SURE HOPE THEY'RE NOT MAKING FUN OF MY BIBLE II RIGHT NOW
Hey , thanks !
Let's call her . . . Dommi Natrix . And she's a -
NEVER PLAY GAMES WITH GOD
WE DID GIRAFFE FACTS BEFORE SO PUT IT NEXT TO THAT ONE
Since when is it my science
Who does that ? He's PROBABLY getting dirt all over the carpets like nobody's business !
Every time he sleeps he puts a sign on his door that says , " Warning : Nappy Times ! Enter only if you have a valid passport to dreamland ! "
THE AMAZING TECHNICAL ORIGINS OF WORDS
HEY ! You're off the list !
Okay , but I heard you had cooties ! I heard you had them bad !
LATER : T - REX HAS FAILED TO MEMORIZE ANY NEW FACTS ABOUT HIMSELF
Hah hah haaaaaAAAAAAHHHHhhhhssuming I was aware of it , probably scream a little ?
So we got into a fight !
If I could give up any sense , what would it be ? It's not going to be hearing or talking , because I do those ALL THE TIME .
You have retreated too far into the realm of fantasy and have forgotten that I did not in fact expire in the shower !
Dudes , in Catalan the stories end " and with a dog and a cat , the tale is finished " ! You are guaranteed a dog will at least make an appearance in every story ! !

FLOOD THE PLANET
TO THAT I CAN ONLY SAY
This one's new ! It's POLITICALLY CHARGED .
Wait - what if you're the only person who can do this ?
Are we still friends ?
Extreme !
Don't blame me for having the best party , THANK me that you didn't experience it , because now you won't be disappointed with all future parties ! This heavy burden must be borne by me and Dromiceiomimus alone .
Nenu gudlu , paalu , venna tinanu .
Well , today I made peace with the possibility that if I die tomorrow , people might not say " Such a tragedy ; he had so much potential . "
So you want to die and be posed holding a sign MADE OUT OF SKIN , and all the sign says is " Dudes , What's Shakin' " and there's not even a question mark .
Not anymore , Utahraptor ! ! " I vow " is the new " I swear to God " !
But T - Rex - photons don't have any mass , do they ? If they had mass , wouldn't that mean that walking outside on a sunny day would mean being hit with trillions of tiny bullets , reducing everything to a red , pulpy , well - lit paste ?
Hey T - Rex , want to try my Pultizer - prize winning clam chowder ?
Do you regret anything ?
Is there a verb for making your own echos ? It seems like there should be a verb for making your own echos .
I think I need to start thinking " outside the box "
I'm pretty sure I could be an amazing dentist , you guys !
" Your mouth is full of cockroaches : many of them are dead , but those that aren't yet are throwing up on you , and each other . "

What did our hands get UP to ?
CELEBRATION IS MANDATORY .
Attention , everyone ! Granny Smith apples are way more awesome if you call them " T - Rex FlavrCrunchZ 2K10 ! "
Because I'm PRETTY SURE it's AMAZING .
EXACTLY . Can we stop pretending music is this powerful ? It's not . I'm sorry , it's not . If it WERE , there'd have been no wars in the 60s because we all would've stopped in the name of love when the Supremes QUITE POLITELY asked us to . AND YET , THE 60s STILL HAD SEVERAL WARS ? ?
Ahh . . . .
But a GREAT book title sells some friggin' books !
Me sense of proprioception !
Mozart ! I SAID to watch me for the changes and try to keep up !
So let's make one of these bets !
What now ? !
IT'S SAD ABOUT AUSTRALIA BUT YOU'RE ALL SECRETLY AGREEING THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS KIND OF AWESOME , RIGHT ? ?
All I REALLY want is someone to look through my stuff when I'm not around and find something that makes them say , " Wow , T - Rex had such a rich and inner life and incredibly powerful imagination ; I guess he really WAS one of the greatest minds of this or - I'll say it - any other generation . "
Sooooo . . . scientists thought of this .
Pessimists say that by expecting the worst , they're pleasantly surprised when things don't go that badly ! I thought I'd give it a try , but honestly . . .
Sheesh , of course I would ! I make jokes about whomever I please !
I'm T - Rex and I demand instant gratification !
Just an innocent bro grab COME ON BUDDY
How about instead I annihilate your species with a giant piece of rock ?
" The world can no longer support the demands made of it and civilization has collapsed in a Malthusian catastrophe to a pre - agricultural level ! "
NO , I didn't commit some horrible crime !
The saddest thing I can imagine is a kid who's very sick , but who still loves to play marbles in the park ! He's got a mobile IV , and one day it gets stuck in a storm drain on the way to the park , and in trying to free it , he loses all his marbles in the sewer .
Despite happening once a year everywhere in the world , the verb " spring " does NOT mean " to melt snow and reveal someone's stale old dog poops " . Instead , it means " jump or leap " . . . something an abstract concept like a season LITERALLY CANNOT DO !
Are you sure you want to quit ? ( Y / N )
I suppose now you're going to suggest we do something so amazing that the future will HAVE to check us out ?
T - Rex ! We'll be late for the movie ! !
Each lurid death reported in the paper akes you a little more cynical : a little more dead inside .
Later on a friend of a friend of Pete's retold this story , but he left out the part where Pete was logical . That friend then died seven days later ! AND AROUND HIS NECK WAS A RED SCARF ! !
I'm going nuts !
Because pals !
Okay , so we covered how everything in a computer is stored in binary code !
THE THIRTEEN GIRL NAMES
In cartoons , when you're really smart , your head gets ginormous .
Today is a good day I think for picking up a foreign language ! To better myself and the world , so to speak !
Wouldn't you agree , Dromiceiomimus ?
. . . Don't you ?
Sheesh ! This instantly raised the rating of our story from G to PG - 13 !
And hey , if you fall , you'll be whipped backwards at the speed you were travelling at !
We need to go two towns over and start building our alter egos !
What would it be like to be a millionaire ? To have effectively unlimited disposable income ?
I've never seen you do either of those things . Besides , if the biggest worry you have in life is glasses , then I think you're doing pretty well !
Excuse me , sexual congress ? Everyone else on the planet is dead , and you'll only die when you've fully mourned each and every one !
. . . Okay .
So the ghost world is full of zombie ghosts attacking regular ghosts ?
Yes , I accepted it without questioning .
If you trash something , you might say , " Daaamn ! I just totalled my own legs ! ! "
THE WORST
I'm disappointed , T - Rex ! You're not living up to the possibilities of your decision !
So you don't drink to excess ! Hooray !
THIS LEADS TO SEVERAL MUTUALLY - SATISFACTORY , CONSEQUENCE - FREE MAKEOUTS WITH EX - GIRLFRIENDS :
To make up for THAT , I'm going to have to spend the rest of the day talking about women I've had the opportunity to kiss !
He can live 9 YEARS off of 14 dudes ?
TODAY is the day we talk about meritocracy !
" Oh boo hoo ! ! I live in the future and I'm mad about T - Rex from the past , better cry into my FLYING CAR THAT TALKS "
COMPRESSED SONG COMICS " WOULDN'T IT BE NICE " BY THE BEACH BOYS
MAN I HEAR THAT
I had a friend ( female ) who dated her roommate ( also female ) .
No ! My idea of happiness is stomping !
It depends on what alleles you're talking about . In the same gene , they're called an " allelic series " but in different genes , a set of alleles is known as a " haplotype " .
BECAUSE THEN YOU GET A BUNCH OF GOLD BUT IT HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS AND DISTANCES YOU FROM YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU REALIZE THAT FRIENDSHIP IS THE REAL TREASURE
And let's go on being conservative and say that only one event happens around us per second !
Also I got ruuuuude
No natural language uses the " blowing a raspberry fartnoise sound as a phoneme , which is just - it's just - well , it's too bad , Utahraptor .
ERROR ! !
Man , I totally just lost an imaginary rap battle !
I like my women like I like my dogs : found and picked up in a park !
Really ? Well , I can see why that would make you sad . Tell you what , take all the time you need . I'll be here when you're done being sad .
Relativity means that time dilates the faster you move .
Bruce Wayne's parents are killed by ants . Bruce uses his fortune to invent super - strong polymers that can be used as ropes , and the shooters to go with them , and begins dressing as the natural enemy of the ant : THE SPIDER .
Filled with . . . ice cream and kittens ?
ALSO WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAY
Yesterday God said vanilla's boring and now he's saying it's actually good .
FEDEX HAS BECOME A REAL PERSON
Never do that !
It's awesome . There's a part where the chase takes us to outer space , on rockets ! And then after a gun fight IN ORBIT we're both in freefall back to Earth - but without parachutes and with our spacesuits rapidly heating up ! Will this fight end in victory . . . or in fiery death for us both ? FIND OUT IN MY NEXT BOOK !
Personally , I'VE always had a beef with " panties " .
Exactly ! And if we get some friends in the audience , at least THEY can laugh .
How long eating carrots is too long ? How much sex is fatal sex ? How many chuckles in a row until you chuckle your last ? ?
Hello and welcome to Super - Fan , the # 1 talk show for fans of Superman !
MEANWHILE , IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T - REX HAS BEEN STEALING HELICOPTERS SINCE HE WAS EIGHT :
LATER : T - REX VANDALIZES A BATHROOM WALL WITH THE WORDS " STEPHEN HAWKING AND CARL SAGAN , YOU BOTH HAVE UNWITTINGLY DONE ME A SMALL UNKINDNESS "
No , that's dumb . The ice level is called " Oh , no ! King Richard The Third Has Chilly Pants . "
And I keep forgetting to remind you !
Leave it to me to totally solve your emotional problems !
Right , right ! " LOOK OUT , humanity ! I embody post - war nuclear paranoia ! "
Superman is good at reporting , can fly , can survive in space AND can travel through time . He should be doing SCIENCE . Good grief , we could learn so much about EVERYTHING if Superman would put on a lab coat once in a while !
So you're using sexism ironically now !
Therefore I have resolved to make my life better " copy " and will , from now on , style my activities such that they'll be appealing to a hyopthetical audience !
I - is that a light attaching to you ?
Well , that's good . I think people with cell phones get teased enough .
NOT ANYMORE .
So generous !
Ghosts feeding on our energy would feel pretty exhausting , but ghosts only come out at night ! So if this is true , we'd be TOTALLY FINE during the day but then we'd all get really sleepy each ni -
There'll be PENGUINS
Why , Apparently , it's me - T - Rex !
They've done a pretty good job so far and I don't see Brainiac running around in real life that much ? Except at comic conventions ?
I refer of course to the trademark symbol . Right now all it means is " I paid the government some money to make sure you can't say this sentence in the same places I get to say this sentence " , but we can change that . We could use it to mean anything ! ?
I'm going to use it to explore PREJUDICE . What's it like to be a man of tears in a world where most men don't even like to cry at weddings ? He faces a lot of preconceptions .
POWER BALLADS
Its danger is not just that it is often self - congratulatory , but also that judging historical figures by present - day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry . What we see as questionable ( say , sexism ! ) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time , and we can't really blame historical figures , I think , for not questioning it !
. . . I got you a Batman train .
Woo - hoo ! Let's have an adventure ! !
Ghosts ! They're pretty boring ! I guess when you die you're like " Finally , a chance to be invisible and undetectable . I'm not wasting this opportunity by talking to some living dude . " Nobody even threw a plate !
IT ? S THREESOME O ? CLOCK
This is depressing , let's talk about poo atoms again !
Why is the sea SO WEIRD ?
This mouse was not only in my house but in my kitchen and on my kitchen counter . Clearly , he needs to die !
So get a job ! Problem solved !
There's probably other books for that , I dunno

It RECONTEXTUALIZES the book . People will be like , " I thought this book was transcendental until that last sentence when the talking filing cabinet showed up ! "
TWENTY TRILLION THEORIES OF TRUTH LATER :
But maybe it is though ! !
" I liked the words and the plot was neato skeet - o " .
THE HELL
I have NOT
Good work , Mary !
And afterwards , what happens is what cooks call the " Columbian explosion " , where fruits and vegetables brought back from the new world have a profound effect on the cooking in the old one ! Tomatoes and potatoes are but two of the best - rhyming examples . When people back home discovered these vegetables , they started experimenting with them and coming up with all sorts of crazy , YET DELICIOUS , dishes ! The Columbian explosion was an explosion of TASTE .
Dromiceiomimus ?
They're random firings of sleepy brains . They're stupid stuff that my brain does to entertain itself when I'm not around to make it look at chicks or punches .
It's trackable !
What ? No ! She's still not sure if seeing colour helped -
CONGRATULATIONS ! ! NOW YOU KNOW ENGLISH !
GRANTED !
Thanks T - Rex ! Um , how'd you know my size ?
Okay , so let's assume you know the position of every air molecule in the room .
God knowing if I put the apostrophe in the wrong place in homophonic spoken language ! !
Dude it's like my favourite sport , not a word of lie
Or at least , I did choose the future until I realized that things might not ACTUALLY be better down the road . If I lived 300 years from now , I could be living in a post apocalyptic time where most life has been obliterated by a catastrophic asteroid impact - an impact so large that enough dirt has been thrown into the sky to BLOCK OUT THE SUN , disrupting the entire food chain and causing mass extin -
Sure ! But it can also decrease in value , both due to events ENTIRELY OUTSIDE YOUR CONTROL .
That's even worse ! We've got nuclear waste that has to be managed for the next thousand years . SOME MAGIC SURE WOULD BE HANDY FOR THAT , HUH ? ? WOW . WOW IT SURE WOULD .
Aw man , did something gang aft agley in here ? Something smells like it gang afty agleyed hardcore .
T - REX EARLIER WERE YOU IMPLYING THAT WE SHOULD ALL DEFINITELY FORGET I SAID ANYTHING
AND SO :
Water wizards AND fire wizards AND sand wizards AND wizards both of air and space , not to mention all sorts of wizard spells that can become terminal . Also not to mention all the other sorts of hexes , curses , and dark magic carried by POTENTIALLY EVERY WIZARD I HAVE AND WILL EVER MEET .
On the other hand , I thought " feeling blue " tied into the water theme well !
Yeah , it totally does .
Hooray for visiting old friends !
He slumbers still ? !

What I'm doing with my life
- oh , what's it called -
SO DO I , ACTUALLY .
Room 304 is how you remember it ! It's - it's
LISTEN WHAT IS IT YOU DO ANYWAY
When we come around later to check on her , Nat ? still naked ? says the man's gone but that she's determined the nature of the perfect sky : torn . She insists she's not crazy OR sleepy . " I'm wide awake , " she says .
I've got claws on my feet too !
Even when you go swimming they cling to your flesh , hungering and furious . And it's not just bugs ! Those birds that flew into your window still haunt you , trying to peck out your eyes with beaks that , LUCKILY FOR YOU , now pass through physical matter . And that's not even considering our dead cave - ancestors : agitated , frustrated , and confused !
Well , I'VE actually got an emergency SUPER SECRET prank that I won't talk about , in case I ever do get the chance to pull it off .
Dromiceiomimus you're coming too , right ?
The courses are SO EASY , Utahraptor !
Why all this talk about self - doubt , T - Rex ? Are YOU self - doubting ?
Featuring T - Rex ? That would be a lot of presents !
I'm a little sad !
It's a little thing called " politeness " ; look it up ?
A grid is provided , so you put your letters down there . For example , you may want to say with " WHAT CAPRICIOUS GOD WOULD CRAFT THIS TERRIBLE FATE " , but you won't have enough letters for that . So you'll fall back to " HELLO " , but oops , no " E " , so instead you open the conversation with " ABS " . Your friend , in similar circumstances , might reply " HAT " .
Pros do this ALL THE TIME .
Bad news , T - Rex : we don't have any cups !
So what's your story ? You need a story beyond your premise .
Is it a . . . DOG ?
I want to watch the Olympics of , I don't know - general knowledge ! Let's see our greatest champions of knowing a bunch of things compete ! !
MOVE SOMEWHERE NEW AND START A NEW LIFE
Yes ! Remember that little red - scaled dinosaur you had the biggest crush on ?
You're surprised ?
TIP # 45
Maybe I'll dress up for Hallowe'en as a Utahraptor !
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
Perhaps you didn't like it because it's too . . . CRYPTIC ?
It's too awesome .
You know ! The re -
Well - it's just , you tend to take ideas to comedic extremes . So I just wanted to make sure you remember that you shouldn't dismiss the opinions of others entirely !
Hello ? ? Marty's parents share a relationship - making kiss at that dance ! The parallels are TOTALLY OBVIOUS .
A SPACEWOLF has disassembled her grandroid and was now wearing her SYNTHOSKIN as a disguise ? ?
Hey , T - Rex , did you borrow my shovel ?
So , God !
And the lesson is simple : DON'T just speed down the lane so you can butt in at the front of the line .
DINOSAUR COMICS
WE'LL TALK WHEN YOU STOP EATING ARTIFICIAL ETHYL - VANILLIN
But robot suits are years off ; it's not like I can just download a technical manual .
Or what if they pick up right now while you're out wandering around with nothing in your hands ? ?
I'd like to set up some authority for pretension , but that itself would be pretentious .
Speaking of which ! Dromiceiomimus , would you like to go get some ice cream ?
PART ONE
I heard some guy heard that some OTHER guy ate a sandwich the size of THIRTEEN HEADS !
Well please turn away from me if it does !
NOTE : DINOSAURS WENT EXTINCT WHEN THE EARTH WAS HIT BY AN ASTEROID , WHICH IS SAD BUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMIC
BECAUSE WHO WOULD ARGUE WITH FRIGGIN' SHAKESPEARE ? ?
That you're a very handsome , clever and successful young man !
Ladies and gentlemen : I have solved the Wikipedia Problem !
. . . pi ? atas ?
You know , I'd always hoped that I wouldn't end up as one of those guys who dies in front of his TV and nobody notices fora decade . THIS IS WHY I HAVE FRIENDS . But you guys wouldn't even notice ! They'd fi nd my skeleteon 10 years later and you'd be all " OH YEAH ! Wow ! Remember him ? "
But then what about the colossal centipedes with the lamprey mouths at each end ?
THE OBVIOUS EXCEPTION BEING WOMEN WHO DO NOT RESPIRATE OXYGEN
stop saying " frig " so much
Girl the blood keeps coming out , can you call my mom real quick ? ?
She's my niece from another Maurice ! That one works if you know two Maurices , with nieces .
Hah ! Accidentally !
Okay , wow ! That's cool . I didn't know phones could do that !
Okay , so I ate a fly ! !
I HEARD THAT
Good luck ! You'll need it , I think !
" Correct , " said Angola .
. . . I don't get it .
How were you aware of the extreme extent of my desire ? How were you aware that I would offer my affections without hesitation ?
OKAY WORK
Rrr ! Just thinking about how bad that poem was is making me angry !
So - it's something that's applied to your work after it's completed . Unless you want to write specifically to a generic form , you don't have to worry about it !
Inventing superheroes : too friggin' hard !
These are our hills ; we shall die on them .
The mere sight of you has returned my anger ! Why did you put out that book ?
Hah ! Monocle guy ! The kangaroo just punched off your monocle ! !
Yes , honey ?
Reports indicate the " ghost plane " drifted for years over Europe before being found . The plane was undamaged , but in - flight meals were only partially eaten , as if abandoned in haste .
Perfect ! !
Okay let's try this again . Last time went a little off the rails , but the fact remains that we do in fact need
" QUICK , TELL EVERYONE THAT THOSE ARE 'INTESTINES' AND THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY NORMAL "
Where does knowledge come from ? Does it derive from our obsercations of the world , or could it possibly be . . . innate ?
I'm in the prime of life !
With words now meaningless , points do the heavy lifting for communication . 16 points might mean " I now realize how much I valued our easy intimacy " , 40 points with a triple word score saying " Promise me you'll never forget how we were , before this game . "
. . . around ! It's so the audience stays around .
OKAY YOU ARE A GROWN ADULT SO
In that case , he sends you a followup note that says " You know just what to do " .
Oh . OH . Okay , yeah , sex happens when two OR MORE people . . . wait . I forgot I found out you don't even need another person to have sex ! !
Oh hey Utahraptor ! Check this out : a dog with a missing foot hobbles into a bar and drawls " I'm looking for the man who shot my paw " !
There totally isn't . If there WAS such a secret word , then everyone would be having some really fun and satisfying weekends !
And he actually IS an alcoholic !
THEN THE HORSE KICKS OUT THE OLD PILOT AND SAYS " BALE OUT " LIKE BALE AS IN HAY
Watson nodded , carefully extricating his fingers from his own goatee . " A whole new universe for us to do crimes in , " he said , " for as you know , we are both the Twin Napoleons of Crime , with you committing the most ingenious acts of criminality and deduction while I record them in a series of letters used primarily to taunt our victims " .
For example : while adults are by definition fully grown , children are much smaller ! Adults have more life experiences than children , who may have very little ! Adults , legally , are fully - recognized people , while children are not ! They do not have the same rights .
NOBODY ASKED YOU !
Why announce it at all , you know ? Just pull a Bruce Wayne and drink ginger ale like it's champagne !
Utahraptor , come quick !
HE'S SHAVING IT THE DAY * AFTER * HIS SISTER'S WEDDING
I can't handle the fact that my neighbours are poopy raccoons
HOORAY FOR WEB CARDS
But where are you going to get a skeleton ?
It's ridiculous ! It's like asking Kellogg's what their Cereal of the Day is . Hey , here's a hint ! I BET IT'LL BE A CEREAL MANUFACTURED BY KELLOGG'S !
Hey , how come everyone keeps trying to email this card to themselves ? !
In retrospect , writing a play " worse than Shakespeare " wasn't a challenge at all ! Perhaps I could have spent my time better than on composing " The Smelly Dog That Pooes : The Action Play "
Shakespeare , I LOVE how you quote yourself instead of actually talking to me .
I never knew that about him !
In fact , it's quite the opposite . The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes !
Does not seeing everything through the lens of economics ultimately reduce all relationships , in fact all of life , to mere line items on a hypothetical statement of earnings ?
This is not good news for Team T - Rex !
You could ! One that's OUT OF CONTROL !
Shakespeare , you should write a story where elephants get to be our pals !
Technically correct , Dromiceiomimus !
" RAD , ME TOO , LATES "
What's happening to me ? I feel so different all of a sudden !
. . . now I'd say " As a mommy blogger , I think chicken wings are gross and stupid . AND I VOTE . "
Nobody should be excluded from games just because they can't afford a cummerbund , top hat , and pince - nez !
Rather , they're islands that we thought existed , but then when we checked 'em out again they weren't there . Were they pulled beneath the waves by Poseidon's watery hand ? Were they perhaps . . . STOLEN ? DID SOMEONE HEIST AN ENTIRE ISLAND ? ?
THAT'S the true theme of Super Mario Brothers . Um - at least until Marioo dies and he has lots of extra lives and can do it all over again , so really if you don't live life to its fullest just try harder next time . Building theme in interactinve media can be a challenge , okay ?
Sadly unchanged !
When I die , nobody say " he's at peace now " , okay ? I'm so serious right now .
You know , I've never really been comfortable with being a vegetarian Dromiceiomimus .
Hi !
Have you tried ?
So my energy needs are equivalent to slightly heating 2000 litres of water . That's , what - a big bathtub or an extremely tiny pool ?
Like everything I've EVER DONE WRONG OH GOD
Wow , so people really liked it ! You're a celebrity !
Oh no , now you're doing it too ! !
Sheep can't punch .
. . . I'm not one of those yet
I call my film , " A Christmas Carol " . My hope is people will rent it by accident !
It's true ! Huh ! Thanks for the advice , Dromiceiomimus .
You know why old paintings look so wonky ? I'll tell you why : painter dudes didn't know about perspective !
Marilyn Monroe wants to be loved and kissed by you . She has no greater aspirations and is filled with desire to make you her own .
Which is the best boat ? The Baychimo is the best boat ! It weighs over a thousand tons and was used to trade pelts with the Inuit in the 1930s !
Seven years of dreams ? !
Noooooooo
The problem with Valentine's Day is that , if you get your sweetie chocolates , the sweetness of the gesture is tainted with some measure of Societal Expectation !
Hopefully ! But we're also wet , and wet towels encourage mold growth .
So people can bet in - game money to win real - life money ?
These thoughts are , at best , infrequent
HEY T - REX IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS INTERESTING THIS CONVERSATION TOTALLY ISN'T HELPING
Because he's got a disease that robs him of his memories , relationships and identity . It is death before death .
FREE TIME
Once upon a time there was this really great cereal . It was oats in the shape of an " o " , sweetened , and inside the " o " s there were clusters of tasty nuts .
Dear recipient of this comic : You're better off without this jerk !
SURE
They're all siblings ?
Any luck finding Nintendo ?
Utahraptor , sometimes - sometimes I wish you wouldn't call me such awful things like that . You may quote me .
Dear God ! OH , DEAR GOD , KALE - FLAVOURED BEEF
Please continue
Okay - what about " best friends forever " , the people in your life who you'll know will stand by you no matter what ?
It works on all men who have been born .
I know , right ? ?
It's TALKING .
I like it ! Dozens of sequels , all revolving around the same story !
T - Rex , it's just a daydream ! Don't worry about it .
I wonder what life would be like if I were a woman !
And all the ladies proclaim that I'm quite adequate for a man of my racial denomination !
I'm not allowed to punch back because that would be animal cruelty !
RIGHT .
Here is a fact , sometimes we love a thing , and then that thing isn't there anymore .
You criticize only your own imagination !
I'M GONNA SAY
But she only does THAT if you have perfect grammar and syntax when you talk to her . Also , she only understands a few limited languages , and getting her to do anything non - trivial can take WEEKS . In fact , whole companies of specialized teams will work for years on trying to get her to do specific tasks ! Sounds pretty frustrating , right ?
Then I thought of " rock concerts " and it seemed silly ! But " punk rock " seemed ADORABLE .
So there's no real way to tell if anyone is a philosophical zombie . This is the same old " I'm only REALLY sure of my own consciousness " argument , only sexed up with the living dead !
Okay , that's a country , and that's stemming from the Slavic word " kos " , for " blackbird " .
IN CONCLUSION , IF YOUR BOOKS SUCK NOW DON'T BLAME ME
Not really , T - Rex . We'd still be the same people !
Yeah , those calories stick around . Ghoster toaster all the way , man .
Hey ! You punch out turkeys ?
What are you going to name him ?
Robyn bought a camera from an eerie second - hand store . When Robyn returned the next day , the star was AN EMPTY LOT , ABANDONED FOR YEARS ! ! That's right : IT'S A GHOST STORY , BABIES !
Corrupted ?
Here at Burger King we offer meat sandwiches
My favourite cross - cutting technique of all time ?
I've thought of the best story ! Oh goodness . This story will make me RICH . It will make me PRIME MINISTER of being rich . I will be awarded a doctorate in APPLIED RICHOLOGY .
Forget it , Dromiceiomimus ! I don't want to hear anyone's voice all up in my earhole !
It was crazy !
Hello , class ! Ever want to program your own computer game ?
But it's a prequel since 1984 was set in the real world ! ALL history books a prequels to any non alternate history scifi !
Aw , I feel kinda bad about taking advantage of Captain Suggestible . What do you do with someone who is that damn suggestible ?
Oh , hi there . You probably noticed me using the word " dord " just now . If you look it up in the dictionary , you'll find it means " density " - assuming of course you have one of the printings of Webster's Dictionary from before it was caught ! It was supposed to explain that " D or d " were short for " density " , but SOMEONE got confused and made it a word instead .
AMNESIA :
I'VE GOT WOLVERINE CLAWS LIKE FROM THE COMIC WOLVERINE
Someone thinks my email address belongs to somebody else ! They keep sending me pictures of their newborn baby , addressed to one " Ren ? Wellek " . As such , I HAVE BECOME REN ? WELLEK .
Yes ! YES .
From now on , I am all about other , less complex parts of speech . Verbs don't understand me !
Huh ! That was weird !
Big wiggly hairy one , yeah . Dude just straight - up mouthed it .
This has got to stop !
Twenty , though ! You're almost still a teenager at that age ! A baby ! How do you know enough to get married ?
Dromiceiomimus is dating a new guy , Utahraptor ! I kinda feel like - well , anyway , whatever . I don't have time for all these feelings . I'm off to test drive some friggin' De Loreans !
HELLO , THESE ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL LIFE .
I know you are but what am I ?
BOO !
Please ? Promise to meet me in a pub in 10 years , okay ?
You're coming from a medical perspective , right ?
OH DAMN " ESCALATE " IS A VERB MADE UP FROM " ESCALATOR " , WHICH WAS ITSELF A TRADEMARK ! So now you can't escalate . And you also can't zip up your pants . Or go trampolining , roller - blading , or jetskiing . Or tase your enemies .
YES IT IS . It's like baseball , but with a soccer ball ! It combines the thrill of running around bases with the similar - but - distinct thrill of kicking a soccer ball !
Hijinks have ensued !
" I need your help with another of my mysterious cases , " Sherlock said . " Again ? " T - Rex sighed , smiling and motioning for Sherlock to come in . " Well , I guess nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person ! " T - Rex said . Sherlock sat down , pulling out a notebook labelled " ALL MY GREATEST LINES ARE STOLEN FROM T - REX " .
So much for the timelessness of art , HUH ARTISTS ? ?
P . S . I AM NOT FROM YOUR WORLD AND HAVE AN ALIEN CULTURE
Exactly ! !
Just worrying about my personal brand !
let me be the first to say sheeeeeeeesh what is that dog's DEAL
COINCIDENCE , UTAHRAPTOR ? ? Or something more ?
" Standard " is the word you were going to impress us with ? " Standard " .
So ? You don't need to shout it !
Yes PLEASE Utahraptor ! You're on !
It's TUESDAY
But current friends are good too , aren't they T - Rex ?
How come it's not cool to have stories with morals at the end anymore ? Are we too ironic and cool to appreciate a story that , you know , just straight - out tells you what to believe ?
YOU SHOULD MESSAGE ME IF :
LATER : ALL PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED WITH INVITATIONS TO DINNER :
Well , actually , that's one of the things that first attracted me to you : your ability to IGNORE popular culture , your willingness to talk as if nobody's listening .
Oh , suddenly now you're into hearing ?
I tried that , but every theme is taken too !
True . Okay , but say you knew the BEST moment of your life !
An excellent course of inquiry !
ONE DAY IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE . . . . . . . .
That's true , T - Rex , but she sank for very different reasons than the Titanic . Despite the huge hole in her side , she could've remained afloat and motionless , if it weren't for the fact that nurses had opened portholes on the lower decks to get a breeze ! Water flooded in as soon as the ship listed . As much as the Titanic is a symbol for hubris , the Britannic is a symbol of how SHIT GOES FOUL sometimes no matter how well you plan .
No more weeping !
Seriously , I'm top of the class ! By like , a really large margin .
It's an okay story , but as a Terminator sequel , it profoundly disappoints on every conceivable level !
Okay , but that's not fascism . Fascism is authoritarian and includes these ideas of unity and purity and stuff like that . It's a sort of xenophobic culty nationalism ?
I wear them when I'm a relationship counsellor , silly !
I've got some good ones too ! Snikt ! They don't make that sound on their own so I have to say it out loud .
Of course ! Thanks , Utahraptor . And thank YOU , pragmatism ! !
SOON :
EXERCISE = THE WORST THING TO USE A BODY FOR
( She's Indian ! )
Attention , class ! !
It's not all bad , though ! All these choices suggest that in an alternate universe somewhere , each of us is TOTALLY KICKING BUTT .
LATER , T - REX READS THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE FOR " GLUTEN " WHEN IT'S NOT VANDALIZED :
Quicksand more like quickBLAND
EVEN MORE VIRAL ! !
You're suspended - indefinitely !
If someone says something is " a whale of a good time " , I'm expecting to see some marine life .
Yeah , but how do you find them ?
I don't have all the details on my new fantastic story , but I have a title ! It's called " Oh No , I Think That Machine Tells You How You're Going To Die ! "
Not in my version , peeps !
LET ME TELL YOU ALL JOKING ASIDE
SO YEAH I HOPE THIS HELPS
But once he flipped it that business was finished , so he could bounce . So now Robyn had a ghost building that could manifest and disappear at will , and once she figured out how to coerce it into appearing into different forms , you know what she had ? A HOLODECK . She had a friggin' holodeck , Utahraptor . God damn .
Welp , I'm going home to mark time until my body dies and takes my spirit with me !
But Utahraptor !
Another friend of mine is getting married !
To hear her tell it , she intends to get her male opponent " hot " , and then she intends to show him " what she's got " . She assures us , the audience , now presumably with one raised eyebrow , that this unnamed protagonist ( adversary ? It is difficult to tell ) is fully unable to read her poker face .
Man ! There's a reason adults don't go trick - or - treating !
BY ACCIDENT ?
We ARE born in eggs ! !
LATER : MORE LIES , FOR NO REAL REASON
Me ! Sick !
SHORTLY
Who says " Q . E . D . " online ?
If I were a woman , T - Rex , when we could TOTALLY DATE .
Oh ! I don't like THOSE parts . Well , I guess I don't want to be fascist after all !
SCIENCE VS RELIGION , round three
What if we're brains in a jar or computer simulations , or created one second ago with a fake history going back centuries ? WHO CARES ? It's an untestable hypothesis and therefore irrelevant . This is the only reality we've got , and we're learning more about it every day .
TERROR COMFORTS YOU YOU AS THE TEARS FLOW .
Maybe it's not you , it's me ! MAYBE there were many small things that added up to this relationship not working .
Dude ! INFINITE time . Things get CRAZY .
There's just the knowledge that audits can happen for any reason , AND the knowledge that there's no statute of limitations for tax fraud , even accidental , and that the only other crime with such status is MURDER .
NO , I meant like , what replaceable , CONSUMER ELECTRONICS possession would you want to save ? Also , you can't already have the possession .
Heck yeah !
In fact , welcome to and thanks for visiting my spooky tale , because it's over now . Enjoy your new - found terror , and hey : thanks for listening .
DISGUSTED ? It could happen to you ! Remember my warning well , Utahraptor ! You too , Dromiceiomimus ! YOU TOO , Danni , The Intriguingly Sexy Woman Who Is Only Seen In Flashbacks !
HOUR 20 :
Who here had a series of dreams last night where they were back in school and missing assignments ? The answer : me , T - Rex !
Oh man . You guys want to know what is seriously the WORST thing ever ?
What time is it , God ? !
a comic to print out and physically mail to your parents who just got on the internet !
I play Tony , a widower who has managed , alone , to raise his young daughter right . He's a rugged mechanic with a heart of gold , just waiting for the right person to come along . . .
I HAVE BECOME GARFIELD
Well I was at a DIFFERENT party last night and I caught myself checking my phone all the time !
Now everyone thinks MY dog has super powers !
Done ! !
OBVIOUSLY , if you value the relationship and it's potential future more than the sum of this problem plus all previous problems , then you should stay together ! I folded that into " mutually satisfying " .
He usually travels with one or more companions who help him on his adventures !
Because if so , I approve 100 % !
It gets sadder ! Sometimes I imagine he's bought books on how to get your kid to floss , and he's tried everything the books say but still , I don't floss - and he's started to wonder if there is something wrong with HIM . Has he failed me as a dentist ? As a FATHER ? Where did it all go wrong ?
I must say , I planned the murder well and pulled it off perfectly .
That's easy !
Okay FINE , we'll do Plan Omega . Upon closer inspection , I can see myself REALLY getting into Plan Omega !
I'm totally breaking up with you , Eve ! For real this time !
Hah hah hah ! ! NOPE
I guess I just can't get past my prejudice against people with stupid faces for jerks .
Oh my goodness , Utahraptor , you have no idea !
I would eat out of a box labelled " Dedicated To The People Who Get Hungry And Don't Care About Food , But Also Don't Want To Die " , like , MINIMUM three times a week
Hello , T - Rex speaking on my T - Rex Speakerphone ! Who may I say is calling ?
It's true ! MANY teens don't care about pi ; it is a fact al mathematicians must admit in their heart of hearts ! !
And I'm glad WE'RE friends as well , Utahraptor !
Now you can't even read every book CURRENTLY IN PRINT : way too many enter every year ! Maybe you could read every book printed in a single year , if you spent your entire life doing it ?
Utahraptor ! Can you tell when I'm being sarcastic ?
I have started a radio show ! It is an advice show . People can call me and I will give them advice on all of their problems , from being locked out of their house to being EMOTIONALLY locked out of their house in a RELATIONSHIP .
I don't need an AK , cause I've got a foot ! That can stomp your house into a pile of soot ! Sucker MCs see me bend my knees -
Perhaps instead you'd like to purchase " Self - interested Bear " , " Shorn Cyclist " , or " BEACH BUNNY CHURCHILL " ? ?
But if you want to know about life 6 million years ago , there's only a handful of fossils !
What do they say ?
OH MY GOD JUST DO IT OKAY ? ?
Science has all the answers AGAIN !
Secret house ?
I HAVE MY OWN PLAYSTATION
HE STOPPED TALKING TO ME AFTER I REFUSED TO STOP ADDRESSING HIM BY ONLY HIS FULL NAME AT ALL TIMES
I have a friend who was hit with a 40 pound log on the head . She might have a concussion ?
But if you can remember how the lucky ones got a single ( very expensive ) picture taken during their lives - if that - MOTION pictures for everyone would seem pretty amazing .
There's some things I do that nobody else does . Maybe I decorate my room in a particular way ! You can put a LOT of things in a room ; it seems reasonable we'd all decorate it slightly differently !
Look , I saw the movie and here's what happens : Mr . Darcy is a dick , later on he's still a dick , Elizabeth falls in love with him for no reason , they get married and he stops being a dick I guess .
* I * wonder why he's , uh , naked ?
However , as zombies cannot retain the mental control to re - enter the physical plane , they are stuck in the spirit realm forever !
Luckily , he was in luck ! There was a vampire in front of him who was very erotic . If you were to rank her eroticness from 0 to 10 she would be a 10 probably . Her body was very " hot " in the metaphorical sense and Steve liked thinking sex - ideas about it . What would it be like to , you know , have sexual relations with her ? He kinda wanted to find out !
I would love it if there were outward indicators of being a super genius . I would love it if when someone said " Is there a super genius in the room ? " , as folks are wont to do , I could just point to my GIANT THROBBING VEINY HEAD and raise one eyebrow .
How would it go disastrously wrong ?
Well , all be darned .
And it's a good think too , because otherwise chumps would be camping on the spawn points ! !
It doesn't actually exsist , you know . It is MADE - UP . CHIMERICAL .
This source says : DEFINITELY YES .
Really ? Hmm . . .
Dang it
T - Rex it sounded like you were going to give us some advice , but instead you segued into confessions about your personal sexual history .
It could be that I wouldn't even recognize the importance of the day until years down the line - like , if today is the day I come across an abandoned violin and ten later I discover that I'm actually seriously excellent at playing sonatas , and then I become famous for playing sonatas . That would have a huge effect on my life , and TODAY COULD BE THAT DAY .
Well good !
Mi scias .
Bruce Wayne's parents are killed from complications of a manservants shortage , so Bruce grows up to become the GREATEST BUTLER OF ALL TIME .
But I'd be returning a stranger to an unknown world that went on without me generations ago , where everyone I ever knew is long dead .
Ans similarly , if I find out an embarrassing but non - criminal secret about you through legal means - like maybe you're a celebrity having an affair ? ? - it's again TOTALLY LEGAL for me ( to ) tell , or not tell , anyone this secret .
None of those skills transferred over , huh .
One day , Pan died . Later on , this dude Thamus drove around in a boat telling everyone about it .
Hey , any ideas for what we should name our new baby ?
NO , because Yelp won't let you review people !
Fictional Jimbo Wales ! You brought cupcakes ! !
Come on , You know PROBABLY it does .
By now , it's likely carried within his body's core !
You know what's popular ? Rebooting old media franchises for today's hip , young , 3D generation ! And you know who can do popular things better ? I'll give you a hint , it was also an edition of Microsoft Windows .
Dad tries to keep her from flax , but years later , wouldn't you know it , she messes with some flax and gets a splinter and collapses . And Dad doesn't want to bury her so instead he abandons his house with her in it ! Only , she's not dead : she's SLEEPING . Like in her name ?
Sure it does ! It's a magic ring !
FRIGYES FRIGGIN' KARINTHY . Only I don't know for sure if his middle name was 'Friggin' " .

Man , folks have been doing the sex to each other since FOREVER , and I'm supposed to come up with something new ?
Okay so it starts out and there's a day ! A g - g - g - ghost dad !
IS IT YOU
AH SO JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME GOD IS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY
Why are the heavens being denied to us , Santa ?
Whatever , there's no shame in perfecting it on my fifth try while everyone else is still stuck muddling through the same thing .
EIGHT YEARS AGO :
The story of a not - so - classy person who becomes classy and then has some problems - it's as old as time , man ! I'm riffing on the themes that have obsessed our culture since forever or at least since the 1900s .
My ultimate woman is pretty much super awesome , OKAY ? ?
Utiarty , the only thing you'll be killing is time . . .
I'll just be saying that everyone who saw me poop my pants in grade three had a good laugh , and it took a little while , but now each of them has met their maker .
He's um - he's okay !
OH DANGS AND TOOTS ; I SERIOUSLY FORGOT TO GET ANYONE PRESENTS
Truly ignorance is bliss . Ignorance and stomping humans , that is .
And you're bored but also listless ?
HEY T - REX YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY THE UNIVERSE COULD END
I KNEW IT .
TRAUMATIC INSEMINATION COMICS
THIS CONCLUDES RATIONAL LOVE THEATRE , THANKS FOR COMING
Plus a beautiful message , without making the movie too corny .
" The UNAUTHORIZED GUIDE to the # 1 HIT Holodeck Program , SIM - PLANET : EARTH ! Tips , Tricks , And Hacks To Get The Most Out Of Interacting With The 7 Billion NPCs Who Really Think They're Alive ! "
I got a part in the new play down at the community centre !
Since I stomp the girl every day , she represents my daily routine .
Okay - everyone who wants to hear about hottie babes , follow me ! But stay here if you super want to hear about computer junk that sucks .
Well ! I guess our only hope is to focus all of our willpower on changing things back to normal !
T - Rex - I don't think it's working out .
Man , you're a friend equivalent of IE 5 :
What ? ! What was that last one again , T - Rex ?
I have been thinking about what the Utahraptor said yesterday , and by extension the ambiguity allowable in language !
That's stupid , and since when did we start personifying social sciences ?
Maybe try making them celibate ?
Well , unless she didn't like you .
So you're not gonna let me read minds ?
It gives him dominion over the minds of men , and his absolute power has corrupted him , absolutely !
HI ! HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD GO RIGHT TODAY !
Fancier foods , you know ? Or foods that my partner is unwilling or unable to cook for me . I buy food magazines to read about things I haven't tried yet . I -
And may I present , exhibit A : a picture of me next to a video game box and giving a thumbs up . Exhibit B : a picture of someone else throwing their controller away in frustration , while in contrast I'M holding my controller calmly and winking coquettishly at the camera . Exhibit C : fan art I made of me and Shigeru Miyamoto where he's holding a sign that says " T - Rex rules at games ! ! Signed me , Shigeru Miyamoto . "
Well , I'm really early and I'm not going to be able to get back to sleep . Maybe I'll go for an early - morning walk !
You can hire a locksmith to cut the locks open .
DOUG IS BRINGING UP HOW , FOR YOUR INFORMATION , THE SWASTIKA IS ACTUALLY " AN ANCIENT SYMBOL OF PEACE AND LUCK "
We mortal people get an end to pain that immortal dudes never get . Unlike immortal dudes , there's a finite number of times I'm going to stub my toe so hard that it breaks . One time I'll stub my toe and it'll break and I'll be able to say , " There , that's done with . I'm never stubbing my toe THAT friggin' hard again . I can finally put this TOTALLY RIDICULOUS aspect of being alive behind me . " - even if I could never know it at the time !
It was going to be really good , though ! I was going to call really early . I would have said , " DO YOU LIKE YOUR CELL PHONE NOW ? ? "
For have we all not woken up in the morning only to ask ourselves " What is it really like , being a tiny chef in a world of regular - sized chefs ? Is there no book to explore this tantalizing question ? "
Necessary AND sufficient !
Wouldn't that be cool , Dromiceiomimus ? I think that would be cool . You could peek ahead and see every time you get into a fight , so you could be prepared !
We're both married !
LATER , T - REX DISCOVERS SMASH BROTHERS ACTUALLY HAS A CPU VS CPU MODE :
But Grasshopper's a singer ! Ant likes dancing , but she might not even know how to do that ! !
They're not very accurate .
Hey , T - Rex ! This ice cream cake is delicious !
How many emotions are there ? ? I can think of at least three .
i dunno . . . yes ?
I'm back ! The problem was fake and my basement is just a regular basement !
Your skin is really green
So what'd you get me ?
Buy a whole bag of plums , and then eat the plums , and then blame a passing dog for the resulting plummy mess ?
Why not focus on either babies OR children ? That way you don't have to cater to both the " words are hard " and the " these early stages of puberty unsettle us all " demographics .
That's really cool !
That is THE question !
Utahraptor now he's saying he likes me better !
" Come here , Sir ! " you'll say , and in that instant everyone will know you are both 100 % FREEBASED CLASSY . Hah hah ! " Sir , did you poop on the floor ? " " Please , Sir , stop humping ! Sir ! You embarrass us both . "
This is the desire authors have , isn't it ? To say something new that is nevertheless eternal ? To really touch people , to change their lives for the better using only their ideas ?
Who would win in a fight , Superman or Batman ?
Well bye
* " That's the last of it . "
But not all arctic exploration ends in cannibalism , T - Rex !
So let's hear some of this amazing book !
WHAT NO
And the Earth is rotating at about 1600 km an hour ! !
HORSES have long faces !
T - REX IN : DIFFERENT WAYS TO SAY " NO "
I guess - I guess I'll watch you sleep ?
I declare this to be " stomp on houses " day !
You mean stomping on things . .
We're talking dinosaurs !
He punned too often ? And they weren't even , like , good puns . They were always the same puns .
IF THERE'S NO NUMBER , DUDE , ENJOY THE FREE WALLET
Reality !
These people include newborn babies , youth , mature young adults , disenchanted middle - agers , executives - heck , even your own next - door neighbour may be secretely [ sic ] interested in living a meaningful life !
Man , but now you're an anchor for us !
Amazing ! But now I must give you your ULTIMATE CHALLENGE : the saddest ONE - WORD story ! !
It's a great word !
Romance is a genre just like any other ! You just need to know which genre points to hit , and then it's smooooth sailing .
Especially since you'd have to climb up at least part of Everest yourself . Okay , you're right !
But what if he forgets to come up with a funny punchline ? If I have no free will , does that mean that I will be forced to just take up space in the last caption and say nothing at all ?
How . . . AM I ? Well , I suppose the way I am is accomplished through chemistry , but precisely HOW remains unknown . Gosh , we're not even sure if it's POSSIBLE for our brains to fully comprehend themselves , as this may by definition require a better , more advanced brain . However , given recent ( very exciting ) advances in nihilist philosophy , I -
I ?
Before , " boots " was pronounced " boats " , and " feet " like " fate " . PRETTY OLD FASHIONED , dudes ! But what's amazing is that the printing press was invented just before this started , and it was at this point that the spellings of words really got fixed . That's why English has so many oddly - spelt words ! They show the pronunciation of words as they were , just before we underwent the Great Vowel Shift and decided to , you know , say everything differently .
It's not even accurate ! !
I wrote some fan fiction last night !
I saw , T - Rex !
Hah ! PLEASE . They've been trained since birth !
" Elijah was a celibate dude . When he was young he was UH - MAZING , but he's old now . He barely leaves his bed . " Whoah ! My story sucks !
That's totally crazy !
We've all heard this before and we dealt with it . Most of us didn't trip balls . PERSONALLY , I said ? Oh , I get it . ?
Does this mean Christmas is . . . CANCELLED ?
P -
. . . FINE . 11 divided by 34 . 1 is . . . 55 . 68 ?
So Chinese Aladdin goes in and gets the lamp but gets trapped in the cave , so he rubs his ring , and a genie comes out . And the genie takes him home to his mom , who tries to clean the lamp , which makes a second , better genie come out . And there's no 3 - wish limit on THESE bad boys ! So Aladdin uses infinite wishes to become Super Rich With A Giant House And Married To The Princess of China Aladdin .
Hey , that sounds like a great idea , T - Rex ! Let's make resolutions for each other !
I have discovered several advantages to having amnesia !
Hell Road , huh ?
Well , we say the speed of light is about 300 , 000 km / s , because it's been that every time we've measured it . But what if there's a small chance that sometimes , the speed of light can just - change ?
The galaxy's moving through the universe , and the universe ITSELF could be moving .
I call my tale , " Poison Ivy Reflects Batman's Desire to Garden A Little More And Also Mind - Control People So They Kiss Him , And He Is A Little Scared of How That Makes Him Feel . "
1000 : The amount you would walk , in miles , just to be the man who falls down at my door .
Whoa . I mean , YEAH : I was gonna say we're bad at staying focused on boring stuff , but man , we ARE bad at not dying , huh ? We're terrible at it , like , as a RULE . We die all the time . We die in our SLEEP .
Lionel Ritchie says , " hello ! "
whatisherdeal @ irepeatwhat - is - her - deal . com .
Maybe he'll burn himself a little !
" Not romantically , though . "
AMAZINGLY
YES . You want my attention , send me a message by carrier pigeon . A bird struts up with a note on its leg , dude , I am gonna PAY some FRIGGIN' ATTENTION .
OH , YOU KNOW - ISSUES LIKE " SHOULD MOTHERS WITH BABY CARRIAGES BE ALLOWED TO BE EXTREME . "
INSPIRATION 2 : STOMPING ON THINGS
Mammals have it pretty great ! I gotta admit : I'm kinda jealous of them sometimes !
If I die in the game , do I die in real life ?
No . We are , in fact , a little late .
That's a great example . Shakespeare wrote some fantastic plays , but there's only so many of them . But infinite parallel Shakespeares on infinite parallel typewriters pretty much have to give us some terrific pieces of literature !
I was doing a search on my name and discovered that there's ANOTHER guy called " T - Rex " out there !
I'm not trying to WIN it , Dromiceiomimus . I'm just trying to drop " so hey , my DIARY is in the running for a Pulitzer Prize " into conversation !
I mean only to suggest that the uninterrupted progress of the past century could in fact BE interrupted , perhaps by a planet - wide and biblically awesome catastrophe SO HUGE that intelligent life is forced to re - evolve from scratch . In the year 65 , 000 , 000 we may just be catching up to where we are now !
Oh ! " Teens ! Teeens ! ! Teeeens ! ! ! " is objectively better too .
* hugses *
( The similar - to but still legally - distinct from " Stephen King " pen name of me , T - Rex ! )
You could have kids out of wedlock with some random woman !
Later on I wanted to be her so bad all the time , THE END .
Wouldn't you agree , Dromiceiomimus ? You seemed to be having a great time at the party last night !
Actually , I'm someone from three years ago who also didn't follow the news .
Hey ! It IS a lovely day to go on a walk !
I don't understand .
The curses of the Greek gods :
Holy cow ! Why would you build something like that ?
And it was really fragmented back then !
What ? There's plenty to talk about !
T - REX HAS SNUCK INTO UTAHRAPTOR'S HOUSE AND SWITCHED THE HOT AND COLD PIPES LEADING TO HIS BATHROOM SINK .
LASER VISION
Not at all !
I'd like to know where you buy yours !
I actually ran into him ( almost literally ) later that afternoon , and we discussed it some more .
So Batman dies , and the book focuses on his butler Alfred working for Spider - Man instead !
OKAY OKAY , CLEARLY there are some people who have made kitchens a thing and are big into backsplash . I don't know , nor do I even care , what backsplash is !
It's not actually that impressive , T - Rex . I figure I've PROBABLY done it , just as a matter of course !
CONS OF EARTH : botulism everywhere , sometimes too hot or cold , and again I cannot stress this enough : botulism everywhere
If I make a CONDITIONAL bequest while of sound mind and body and possessing FULL TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY , a probate court is entirely likely to honour those clauses !
It's not " goodbye " , just & # 8211 ; " farewell " . This isn't the end , Dromiceiomimus , but merely the end of an era . One door closes as another opens , and we can't forever live in the past ! A new , brighter light beckons .
Huh ! Well , tell you what . I'll stomp on her first , then you go , OK ?
Oh daaaaaamn ! I'm at the absolute peak of my fried chicken cycle , dudes !
It was an . . . indirect reference ?
How do you play ?
All I've got to show for the past week is a book I published as part of a practical joke that I really enjoyed ! Also I made a delicious meal , but that's gone now . I'm experimenting with eggplant .
HOW TO ADVERTISE CEREAL
LATER : T - REX TURNS UP THE CHARM !
Then : death !
( That's what I wrote in my friend request , incidentally )
He was actually a girl in a boy's body though , which gave him SUPER POWERS . For example , when the other princes said that playing with dolls was dumb , he could play with dolls if he wanted to !
No man , I got this
Maybe this mind - control ray I've hidden in the palm of my hand will make you change your mind ?
Frig , I don't even know if squirrels can conceptualize their own death ! !
SLEEPING BEAUTY : the 17th century version
BOY LOSES BOY : the classic mountaineering story wherein someone gets lost .
maybe i should get me some clothes
We are !
MMMM HERE IT COMES
I just had the craziest dream ! It was about . . . watches ? Anyway , I guess it wasn't important .
. . . Yeah , they're pretty fun actually .
Nope ! It gives me hope , because one day I could meet someone who actually talked like a flapper , and then we could get married !
That is HECK NO not my sort of thing , but I'm glad to know it's an option !
MORE PROFESSION JOKES
After walking for a bit , I found myself in a 24 - hour grocery store ! Why ? I didn't need any groceries . I guess I just found the bright lights and the prospect of buying snacks enticing !
I thought that was vampires .
Is that ME sitting at the last supper ? I believe it is ! Is that me poking my head in front of the Mona Lisa , obscuring her face entirely ? COULD THAT HANDSOME VISAGE BELONG TO ANYONE ELSE ?
God , give me a beat !
It seems like it'd be way easier to just make enemies with one W . T . Freemont that to try to direct the acronymic course of an entire language ! IMHO .
Nooooo , it's like - WAY too many
I'm right here !
Ah , the modified F factor . So desirable in a mate , yet so hard to pin down !
OH SNAP , THAT'S RIGHT . THEY SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER .
Break and enter , aid and abet , lewd and lascivious , law and order , terms and conditions , null and void , free and clear : our legalspeak is so wordy because our laws were translated multiple times , and the translators , as lawyers , wanted to cover their butts .
So the gods show up and they're thinking , " This is gross . This is a stew made out of a dude . PASS . " except for one god whose daughter just go abducted so she's sad so she eats the stew ? Because she's distracted ? By sadness ? Anyway after the party Zeus decides he has the technology to rebuild stew guy , and so he orders it done , only AN ENTIRE SHOULDER is missing because it got eaten . By a god . Because she was sad .
It's LARGER - THAN - LIFE and looks just like me ! ONLY BIGGER . What I'm trying to say Dromiceiomimus is that it's fantastic and you should see it some time soon .
Like this one time she had a gentleman caller spend the night . Nothing happened , but the next day while she was at work , this guy did all her dishes for her !
Not to say that smoking is great , but I too only smoke the occasional cigarette when I've been drinking ! There's worse things I could be doing , like murders !
FRIGGIN' OW
Well you don't have to because that's what Sherlock did next !
NO ONE BELIEVES T - REX EVER AGAIN :
Well , I'm perfectly content ! Hum de dum de dum .
I call my tales , " Stories to Make You Say 'Why Don't These Characters Just Use A Phaser , Man , There's Clearly A Phaser In The Background There' "
T - Rex , how do you let a partner know that they're bad at sex , and second , how do I know that I'm not bad at it ?
Lawmakers have to consider the full impact of their laws !
I still think they're jsut trying to be your friend . They like you !
PERSONALLY , I really like how when you wanted something zombies could show as " bad " , you chose stomping on things .
Oh my gosh .
I understand , and it's difficult to deal with ! But sometimes actors do have to look the part they're playing .
I'VE TRIED
Have you , Dromiceiomimus ?
That's absurd !
Man , that was indeed a good " zinger " I got the Utahraptor with yesterday . I wonder if I can get him again today with some - such similar ploy ?
This DOES explain why no Spider - men Hulks have tried to steal my girlfriend ! !
I need to go write some fanfiction about my own ideas ! !
That's because as of TODAY , I am the proud owner of a robot !
" LN " ?
That works for any movie though , right ? " It's A Wonderful Life ? ! "
I GUESS the universe is trying ot send me a message !
Sherlock Holmes will solve the case using deduction , Dromiceiomimus .
What ? Screw that ! MY DISPOSABLE INCOME IS ALL EARMARKED FOR ONE PURPOSE !
The fact that you exist in real life means that I TOTALLY wasn't wasting my time today talking about the issues involved in sleeping with you ! ! May I just say :
. . . BMX ( TM ) bikes !
ALL THE MONEY
( His memory )
We'll talk and go on adventures even though we're all in diapers ! So , yes !
EVEN MORE TIPS ON WRITING
OH MY GOSH .
BUT THEN !
That happens ALL THE TIME
Oh man , I should totally become the ultimate personification of society ! Everything I did would be instantly symbolic
But sometimes y'all are lazy , and that's fine . We'll just fix generations worth of problems now , and leave the world a better and problem - free place in the future ! No bigs , babies . We got this .
O - Once ?
Ah , so you'd be absorbing energy then .
That one actually sounds really awesome .
Some folks got opinions on what their genitals should be called , you guys !
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS !
I don't know where this is coming from ! I need to go home ! !
So you can see why it appeals to me . We should lexicalize that sentiment into a single English word , so that we too might talk about it more easily and - - dare I dream - - more often ?
I really need to get inside his head !
THE THUNDER - LIZARD'S DAY OUT
But then I wouldn't be friends with them in the first place , I bet - UNLESS they'd kept it hidden until now . Could I be friends with someone , knowing they're a crazy racist ? And would it make a difference if it never really came up that often ?
And also the cholera and influenza and bubonic plague and typhoid fever , and um , smallpox . So basically the world got this explosion of new and tasty times , but also this exchange of disease , and just about every culture on Earth was affected . But what's neat is that we can look forward to the same thing if we ever encounter alien life !
Natalie Imbruglia's going through a rough patch , huh ?
That gives vampires the advantage , dude !
AT LEAST SOME GOOD CAN COME OUT OF THESE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES
Every year we try to stop Him and every year we fail .
UTAHRAPTOR HAS GOTTEN LIFE INSURANCE !
But I've studied dog personalities and used them to construct these custom " fursonas " . For example , this golden retriever likes to pee outside and enjoys sniffing . Ask her if she likes sniffing .
Also !
Kick ass !
Hmm . . . I think so , as long as you'd let her hold it open for you .
They were way _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and my favourite part of their body was their _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . Daaaamn .
THOSE COST TIME . Are we so psychopathic that we think gifts are only good if they lessen the giver in some way ? ?
PROPOSING MARRIAGE
Since conversations don't last forever , then there's a finite number of sentences that make sense and that are at least passibly grammatical , so you can just record every possible response to every possible word combination , and kapow ! Responses like a real person .
I heard that parents should lock up their turkeys , because you'll punch them out !
If you want to get married then first you need to find a mate ! You need to find a LIFE PARTNER .
MEANWHILE , IN TUDOR ENGLAND
I guess PROBABLY because we don't have such robots .
What about all the good times we shared ? How can you be so cold - blooded ? Or was that a lie too ?
Wow ! These small changes in semantics ( he meaning of a word or phrase ) are quite interesting !
The most important part of any joke is the punchline . So come up with that first ! For example ,
Um , sure ! It's long , I guess , with lots of twists and turns , and some parts are dark so it's scarier , and everyone's screaming ! Oh , and at the end , we all accidentally get chlorinated water in our eyes .
Williams Shakespeare , or " Willie " as he may have secretly preferred but never actually told anyone , was a food eater !
T - Rex ? Why do you have to be violent ? You're already in everybody's bad books . Why can't you do something good for once ?
Oh my God ! God is like Herostratus times - - um , five !
Raptors are more important in this one ! Smarter , too !
Yep ! Things are pretty okay ! So , um , any particular reason why we're talking ?
Without invention , technology , or even an oral history to inform us of our past , even a million years can leave no mark on our eternal present , forever unchanging and forever unchanged ! !
Awwwwwwwkwarrrrrrd
Maybe . . . chicken ?
I should go .
Well , what's it like ?
People say ghosts can't kill each other ! But what if . . . ghosts CAN kill each other ?
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE :
T - Rex says , " probably not ! "
YES YOU DID . Baby Utah is CLEARLY based on me , and it's not even a flattering likeness . " I made a baby barfie " ? I don't even talk like that ! Babies don't even talk like that ! !
the name's driving . doctor advanced applied racecar driving , phd . sorry ladies , i was spoken for the exact second i reached marriageable age . ] ]
That would be pretty awful , knowing that on the whole , your life is one of sadness !
Shit man , you know more about this than I do !
I once learned how to hypnotize anyone !
BUT THON THINK INVENTED PRONOUNS ALWAYS SOUND STRANGE ? THON STILL LOOK FOR SOLUTION TO SATISFY EVERYONE .
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE RECALL AFFECTING YOUR BODY
Today is a good day I think for fixing my life ! I'll do it by putting out a new , less controversial book : " LOLITA III : This Time , She's 30 " .
I still think there could be One Perfect Song !
A story with an EGG - citing twist ! !
That letter was sent to the Professor in confidence !
Probably ! He is rhetorical !
Today is a good day I think . . . for adventure !

Utahraptor's personal brand is soooooo sassy
Man , you can't just make up transportation methods !
Ants live in colonies where every ant has a special role , like " solder " , " worker " or " queen " ! Amazingly , ants make up almost 25 % of all the biomass on the planet !
and that's not nice ! Sometimes my reactions are bad , okay ? SOMETIMES , when I know my behaviour is being examined I instantly forget how to have interactions with others , how to sound sincere , AND where to put my hands when I'm not staring at them .
Those who keep their failings secret appear more perfect , and so we too keep our shames private , in order to bring ourselves up to this impossible standard !
No , I love mammals ! I just think they're UNUSUAL , and weirdly big into mammaries . They're so big into mams that they put it right in their name !
So when someone has a time machine , is that anachronism ?
" Exactly ! Also , if you only have sex with yourself there's zero risk of pregnancy or SIs . Am I seriously the only one who realizes this ? ?
You'd react too ! IT'S DAMN UNSETTLING . Plus , they shouted after me about " a new sexual position " . Argh !
It's not EXPLICITLY said , but there's clues throughout the story that the city's doing roadwork outside . And before you ask , the roadwork follows them around , so even while in the zombie graveyard they shout constantly .
" Neato , " said Watson .
Wooo ! I'm talking the talk ! !
Mali - BOO !
I know , right ? Go me !
If we go far enough back , we're all related
You know that , God .
But it's not REALLY a regret , because one day the greatest person of my generation will write THEIR autobiography , and that'll be Antonio fanfic too . It's a pretty big compliment .
Wait , Dromiceiomimus ? What are you doing here ? I was trying to go back in time to visit the CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION .
So help me write a scene of quiet introspection , T - Rex !
People who aren't in love but are sleeping with each other emoji : one where that's great , one where it's a disaster .
Star Industries is the most powerful multinational in the world !
If I were impatient , I'd be a jerkier person . I'd always be hurrying people up , and people would not want to hang around me in grocery store lines .
SHE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU , MAN
Okay ! My new name is " No Shirt No Shoes No " , and everywhere I go , there's companies with a special service just for me !
" HELLO "
Did you just make an asterisk sound ? Why the asterisk sound ?
Yay ! PATIO SEASON IS BACK . I love to go out and have a fun meal in the sun with my pals ! !
That's not a platitude !
Dromiceiomimus , tell me about your relationship problems !
Language is HARD , dudes !
It does ?
LATER : TOO MANY TEENS ARE ON A BOAT :
HOW MUCH G - FORCE CAN I HANDLE ? ?
Noo ! Don't do it !
MAKING UP STORIES THAT ARE WRONG BUT HING THAT YOU DO KNOW THE TRUTH :
Well , I'm certain complete strangers will appreciate your meddling in their mental health and wellness .
You have a job ? ? What do you do ?
Huh ! I guess that's what I get for being born on a planet where EVERYONE ELSE IS 100 % WRONG 100 % OF THE TIME ? ?
Screw EVERYTHING !
IS YOUR DATA FRIGGIN BACKED UP BECAUSE IT ISN'T IS IT
T - REX WHAT WILL THE FUTURE BE LIKE
The war of dinosaur vampires vs zombie ghosts has been won ! The afterlife belongs to the friendly vampires , which is better than zombies ! !
But how are you sure he meant anything aggressive by it ?
Yes ! And it's sassy !
Wait , aren't you missing one ?
No , what ?
I actually can't name ANY mathematicians . Is there one named Steve . . . Multiplication ?
Because if you're doing time tourism , you're going to do it right !
T - REX EVERYONE WILL NOTICE
Really ? You haven't heard ONE good joke ?
I say " Let's order a pizza " frequently enough - AND I'M NOT ALONE - that I propose we start saying " let's'o'pizza " , pronounced " let's - o - pizza " ! It has the added benefit of sounding like you're putting on a cartoon Italian accent !
I think all diseases should be cured !
Among the things I'm told are NOT romance stories are : love between man and sandwich , love betwixt woman and man AND sandwich , and a review of the food at this really romantic restaurant . It has to be two people who like each other , and THAT'S IT .
Easy !
You're a dying breed , my friend ! There are only a few credit watchers left !
There ! Now I've got a certificate from the mayor that says I'm not allowed to name anything ever !
I'm really looking forward to the little soiree I've got lined up for tonight . . .
T - rex ?
And she's not even the REAL Dromiceiomimus !
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO AGAIN
But men can still but regular costumes !
A puppy ! My secret to sadness has always been to take something sad , and then imagine it's happening to a poor little puppy dog with a broken leg .
LITERATURE HAS HIT A NEW HEIGHT , OMG
Come on , what's " undead " mean ? " Not dead " . That's ALIVE , dude . You kill zombies by shooting 'em in the head , and if it can be killed , it wasn't dead , therefore : alive .
But here on Earth , many greedy vampires remain : feeding on the mortals left behind , refusing to step gladly into the light ! So it's up to the few mortals left to overthrow the vampires and carve out a new Earth Utopia ! WE MUST KILL THE VAMPIRES THAT BETRAYED US .
I - I guess ?
So toughness equals manliness then ? Success is a male attribute how ?
NEXT TIME , ON DINOSAUR COMICS :
Why do we do this , Utahraptor ? Why do we have such an unreliable and toxic person in our lives ?
You know it ! And plus , you could do extreme tricks on the way down - like a backside lipslide 50 - 50 fakie !
THE MYTH OF MEDUSA
The mine dried up and everyone moved away !
Can I tell my story now ?
It's a real shame that all those great careers I wanted as a child will probably never come true for me . I'll never get to be an austronaut , a race car driver , or a movie star !
For example : cultures universally have units of time !
Utahraptor , your epitaph scored forty - five thousand out of a possible fifty thousand points !
YES . But honestly , are we SURE it's just a story ? How do we know what REALLY happened in history times , Dromiceiomimus ? I'll tell you how : we turn to BOOKS . And what's the most popular genre of books ? FICTION .
I STILL REALLY WISH DROMICEIOMIMUS HAD BROUGHT ME BACK SOMETHING FROM AUSTRALASIA
Utahraptor will be responsible for teaching you waht to do in a merge lane !
Romance ?
That was awful poetry !
Your perfect life , which you are not living , robs the world of a better you , who would be a more valuable person
Nope ! Our legal system is set up such that dogs cannot own property .
Probably not , cause they're wacky !
For instance : as a male , I can be impatient , sometimes to my own detriment ! Notice how I destroy this house rather than walking around it .
It would be SO COOL to see how things work out . Wouldn't you agree , Dromiceiomimus ?
" SO FAR . "
Hah hah
SOMEHOW , he survived the night , and when the dude woke up the next morning , he checked his phone .
T - Rex it's happening again !
What I'm saying is that this is not truly satisfying !
? t's not gonna take two people to eat this sandwich I bought for myself . I got this . " - that's what they'll say .
OH .
Oh my gosh , it's like , the only advantage of FedEx being a real person is that at least this way he'll ACTUALLY DIE SOMEDAY
How many girlfriends do you have right now ?
I'm an adult now !
In my new movie script , THERE'S TROUBLE AT THE NORTH POLE . With more than seven billion people on Earth , Santa can't keep up !
On the other hand , some lottery winners are less happy a few years after winning than they were before !
BUT ! What if I switch my beliefs to foundationalism , in which I mark a few beliefs as " foundations " I consider to be " self - evident " ?
S - Sapphist ?
Conspiracies !
So by " Choose Your Own " , you mean have the narrative thrust at you haphazardly in accordance with your natural reading pace ?
The year is 1990 , and the world is a very different place ! All those old TV shows you liked are still new ! But more importantly :
If anyone wants to write an article about me , the easiest and laziest thing in the world is to talk about what they can find on social media and draw friggin' imaginary connections , Dromiceiomimus !
I'm leaving town and starting over . It's my only option left .
That only works because it rhymes ! !
That's ridiculous ; I'm renaming her to " Miss Triss "
And then ?
" Dear God , where did I put my glasses ? "
Mime !
What a great expression !
IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
At what point does plagiarism begin , though ? When defining a word , especially in brief , it's possible you'd hit on the exact same word structure as someone else . That's not plagiarism , that's just & # 8211 ; independent invention !
Aren't you describing an addiction to drugs ? Something that makes you artificially happy ?
Utahraptor , you'll speak my languages , right ?
Hmm , I guess this is why people keep diaries : to fight against this inexorable loss !
So you're reverting to 18th century communication media .
You go in circles around things or something ! I don't know !
You're proposing simulations be used for historical research !
Those are the same thing , T - Rex .
Hah , just kidding ! I tried to come up with a way to suppress happiness , but I'm not HAPPY with the results yet .
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN TALKING ABOUT MERITOCRACY
Sounds . . . good ?
Oh man , you're doing the " we " thing too ? I mean , um , you babes are doing the " we " thing too ?
The date is September 3rd , one universe over . Composer Marshall Island has just finished a song that will one day be known as " The Ultimate Song 2000 " .
Cyanobacteria showed up then and ate water and pooped out oxygen . And you know what happened ? The atmosphere changed from basically 0 % oxygen to 20 % oxygen and HEY PRESTO , life exploded .
Mine has to be the quiet yet noble period .
" Whoopsie doodle " ?
You might want to hold off on that trip for a bit !
Perhaps a good stomping will ease my troubled mind .
What about a world - weariness that can only come from watching everyone you know and love age and die while you remain stuck in a perpetual youth ?
If it's natural , then you can't really blame a person for having it , because they didn't have a choice . But if it's because of nurture , then you CAN blame them for it , or the very least their parents ! OR SOCIETY .
DISEASE COMICS
OR WAS IT
BUT I WAS ALREADY ASSUMING THAT
The COMMERCIALS ! The deals on three - ringed binders ! I just want to be a part of that .
They were his CREMATED remains that were made into frisbees !
Which guy just totally shredded his phone bill ? Oh snap , looks like it was THIS guy !
But if I had a transplant , I'd have no idea . There'd be a part of my body with a WHOLE DIFFERENT HISTORY than the rest of me : how is that not awesome ?
MAY I BE THE FIRST TO SAY :
Hey ! Where have you been all week ?
Um , here's another hypothetical for you , Utahraptor : WHAT IF ALL GODS EXIST AND WHEN YOU DIE YOU COULD SPEND YOUR TIME IN LIKE 80 BILLION HEAVENS AT ONCE ? ?
None that I care to remember , Utahraptor ! !
Alright ! Better turn to panel 1 just to be safe ! !
Hey ! You've laughed in my mouth too !
Man , you're looking at this the wrong way !
There's no shame in that ! I do everything naked !
I'm not alone in thinking this , right ? It's kinda weird , right ? It's like , whoaoh , what are we even doing ? What are we EVEN DOING with our BODIES ? ?
Copyright is intended to prevent others from ripping off your creations ! It used to extend 28 years after you created something , giving you a chance to profit while ensuring good ideas would eventually enter the public domain .
Semi - positive ?
with the strength of 20 girlfriends I can lift up cars
It's like sharing your most personal secrets with a friend who's always trying to figure out ways to make money off you !
HEY T - REX HAVE YOU MADE A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
DEONTOLOGY COMIX
Aw , shoot ! My eponym is a disaster !
Yes : panel 5 . No : panel 6 !
" I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS "
You see that ? Proof !
SO FAR SO GOOD
I WOULD CONCEDE THAT WHILE PIXEL ART IS STILL AWAITING ITS MONA LISA OR SISTINE CHAPEL CEILING THE MEDIUM IS INCREDIBLY YOUNG
LISTEN , WHOEVER TOLD YOU " LEARNING IS FUN " FORGOT TO PREFACE IT WITH " ONLY SOMETIMES WILL YOU FIND THAT "
Let's recap !
THIS COMIC WAS NARRATED TO ME LIVE BY ANDREW HUSSIE
So maybe they DON'T like it for the sex !
You're looking at him , baby !
When our mathematical assumptions APPEAR to match up with reality , the results may also seem to apply - but math isn't any more " true " because of that ! It's still based on unproven / unprovable assumptions . And you can actually build up systems where you decide that 1 + 2 does not equal 2 + 1 , and they're just as consistent !
TIPS ON BEING AN ADULT
But what if that delicate process that turns you from from mortal to vampire . . . failed ? What if something in this turning went wrong , even briefly ? We can suffocate to death in minutes , suffer brain damage in seconds . Suppose , during that transformation from a being who needs an active circulatory and respiratory system to survive to one who doesn't , there was a problem . Suppose your brain - everything that makes you YOU - died .
Rather than ONE machine that produces different foods , each version of the machine is specialized , producing only one kind of foodstuff ! That way I can sell more than one machine per person ! AND they're region - locked , so a machine from South America won't work in Europe . I got that idea from a business major ! !
How perfectly PROFITABLE !
FOLLOW THE MAGIC . We don't even know FGM's real name , but we're supposed to swallow " and they all lived happily ever after " as the conclusion to the Commission Report ? ?
Oh my gosh I'm SO SORRY , I did not realize how gross that expression was until I said it .
Oh , you'll grow out of that . Oh snap !
T - REX AND THE SEX PARTY
Awesome !
" Sometimes I just get real sleepy is the thing "
" . . . SOLVING CRIMES WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES , THAT IS . "
Most guys I know are like that , T - Rex .
TRY TO ACT SURPRISED ? ?
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL !
Good !
And yet , the most compelling ?
I - I don't recognize that song .
All are illusions .
He sure is !
Silent films are crazy . They're crazy ! The whole medium doesn't make any sense !
Playing video games , eating food , hanging out with friends , and having ACTUAL SEX .
Hey , you know what humanity's earliest surviving playable recorded sound is ? A man counting to twelve . AND HE MESSES UP . HE MESSES UP COUNTING TO TWELVE .
We . . . we're not ?
It'll be great ! And if things turn out worse with these new decisions , well then - - lesson learned ! I'll just move back here and never speak of it again .
Obviously , my IDEAL address would be 80085 T - Rex Lane , T - Topia , Rexland " , but , you know , one step at a time . So : street names ! How do I get in on that ?
Maybe I should think before I open my mouth
Well you tell him that more people playing games means fewer people looking down on gamers !
Wait a minute ! EVERYTHING ?
Far me it for me to correct GOD , but ?
A tattoo on your butt that folds in when you clench to reveal the message " FLEX TO MEET YOU " ?
RAP TUESDAY
Will this button TRULY change the world ?
Aw man ! Then we're even dumber ! !
I've made another fantastic discovery : a discovery bound to send those music theorists back to their dusty ol' drawing boards ( one dusty ol' drawing board per theorist ) ! For you see . . .
YES I KNOW IT IS AMAZING TO THINK OF
" There IS NO GOD "
Let's NOT invite Dromiceiomimus !
Man , if I were sent back in time 200 years , I could easily make myself into a serious king by " inventing " things two hundred years too early !
I don't have much of a great mechanical understanding . could I design and build an internal combustion engine ? The answer is no . ALTHOUGH , come to think of it , I could invent modern foods like chips and poutine !
Oh my god . YES .
Yes please !
Oh sure , make it sound ridiculous and gross ! Let's ALL ACT like I'm the ONLY ONE who wants a beach - ready , lickable , pickable , on - a - stickable handheld steak chilled to PERFECTION for those hot summer days ! !
So the past is the only safe choice .
WELL
This is kinda getting old , you guys !
We'll live forever !
YOU CAN SLEEP IN MY ROOM , T - REX .
Both disappeared over the hills of snow and have not been seen since . Past these hills the footprints grew larger , apparently gathering snow with each step . Before their end at some mountain foothills , they were over 3m wide , 5m long , and suggested the development of claws .
It's history times and you're living in the Greco - Roman world ! And just like every other time ever , there are jerks here too .
" It's too bad you never go married , eh ? "
The engagement party for Barosaurus ? She got engaged . You didn't know ?
Well my usual advice would be " just be yourself and don't make things weird " , but since this is you . . . what if we bet whichever one of us makes friends with this guy LAST has to pay the winner $ 500 ? ?
That sounds just scientific enough to work !
Okay , yes , I'll admit it . Last night I fell down the stairs . But it doesn't make me less of a man ! In fact , it makes me MORE of a man !
. . . Okay , that was kinda adorable .
I love that I live in a world where I can hear actual secret messages for spies !
That's one !
Only in the drug slang sense , which I'm probably inventing right now !
> that is a picture of a dinosaur
Cover and cook over medium heat until the potatoes are soft !
What sort of secrets ?
What ? I'm not making jo - OH MY GOODNESS . I honestly didn't even think that it could be read that way ! I meant it in the sense of like , a basketball player and then a grade - A SEXUAL basketball player . Not in the sex offender sense !
Do we keep them in order to keep relationships running smoothly ?
Okay . I kinda set you up for that .
Okay , we didn't actually learn much about computers last time . Let's do better this time , huh ?
Angola Maldives , the sexy super spy I invented , was yet again on a mission to save the world !
MOST DEFINITELY
MORE SPECIFICALLY :
And also , sometimes like they're part of a larger work with a distinct thematic focus . Forget that !
Nope ! Firstly , Utahraptor , that's an INCREDIBLY tall order !
Hah ! Future me's awesome .
The 20th century , huh ?
But folks came up with some ways to speed things up . One was to make a cast of commonly - used words and phrases , so when you needed to say " sexy T - Rex " , you could just grab the piece instead of an " s " , an " e " , an " x " , and so on .
* ahem *
" I deduce . . . that this case DEFINITELY has me stumped ! " he said !
Today is special because today is the day I show everyone how manly I am . Today is the day I punch out the friggin' sun ! !
And that makes you irrationally jealous ?
No , this isn't that kind of recall . This is more the , " you should RECALL this crazy vulnerability whenever something comes close to your chest " sort of thing . Okay bye !
Then Watson identifies as female , calls herself " Mary Jane " , and marries Spider - Man , but later goes by " Emma " and acts in teen wizard movies ?
Dudes !
If it works , I can go further , also consigning smells and foods to certain periods in my life ! I'll be an old man , looking up " first marriage " in my database , and then reaching for a record player and my first bite of Wensleydale in years .
" Holy cow , I'll do that . This story just got totally rad . "
Exactly ! It's right up your alley .
Kid , most screenplays are written down , not described verbally .
Line ?
" Queue " is pronounced " queue " ! And the letter " q " is pronounced the same way ! !
Yes , I will freely enjoy stomping more now that he is gone !
But you've said WAY more than two lines , my friend !
Or maybe . . . we're simply creating them on the fly when you request them ?
OR AN ENEMY COULD BE POISONING YOU TO DEATH , A LITTLE EACH DAY .
But I worry this fixes only SYMPTOMS of sexism , but not the root cause .
. . . Ohhhh
Though remices usually don't replace the origional . Here you want to progress over time , so you remic and the remix gets remixed , and then 1000 years later you've produced the ULTIMATE REMIX and then everyone goes home because culture is over .
You're going to be giving out presents , T - Rex ?
This madness must end ! TO THE LIBRARY ! !
I GUESS THERE IS A LESSON HERE FOR US ALL !
Okay , but with great power comes great responsibility !
So ? What do you think , Pulitzer Prize - winning author Michael Chabon ?
OH ! ONE MORE THING ABOUT BODIES :
Worst answer to " What do you want out of your investments " question YESTERDAY'S CHAMPION
We were wrong . The [ redacted ] protocol has confirmed our worst fears : while " Frosty " 's MOVEMENT was exceptional and initiated by the " old silk hat " ( case file # 4523 ) , his sentience was not . To be perfectly clear , Agents : while they live and die fully immobile , each and every snow man , woman , and child is a living , sentient creature .
What's the one song that most people will hear the most often in their lives ? The Probable Worldwide Most Listened To Record Holder ? I'll give you a hint : it was composed like 200 years ago !
So then you've got this small collection of countries that make all the news ! World politics is how these countries relate to one another , and , internally , to themselves .
Man , how can ANYONE be certain of the sincerity of anything ?
Aristotle is one of the biggest figures in Western philosophy ! Dude basically invented it . Fun !

Next is " hot as fish grease " : 190 degrees celsius , or 19 boring grounds stacked together .
But I made a list and I've already got like four or five T - Rex's conditions . Plus , Appetite Asperger's has assonance going for it !
Is that the -
So if you have Bond getting gadgets that he doesn't use , that's not Chekhov's Gun ?
Sometimes ! But I don't have a very good imagination for that sort of thing . What would I be , a romantic lead ?
Hey , imagine if the only quotation that survived from you was " Time to get myself into some of them quote books " ?
But if I spent my time in school I'd get a degree at the end !
It's time for some embarrassing stories !
Does language alter the way we think ? Sources say : perhaps !
Laughing in recognition is fun ! We all should do it right now !
T - Rex what are the odds of you , you know , actually wearing pants ?
If you want that sort of thing you'll have to go to hell .
Do email !
GOD . Fine , here's your answer : very , their secondary sexual characteristics , making a sex time , getting down to the business of sex , good then better then good again .
problems have their own romance too
But then Angola started shimmying out of his clothes !
Meanwhile , the hole he'd created by pushing FIVE SEPTILLION KILOGRAMS with his BARE HANDS went all the way to the planet's core , causing it to explode outwards in a huge , terrible volcano .
Wait , why are these people in the hospital waiting room ?
Why did I say that ? ? I AM EVEN MORE POOCHED THAN EVER BEFORE .
No , Utahraptor : this isn't a story . It's HISTORY . OUR world IS the flipped world ! !
Uncanny ! I seemed to have switched places with my mirror - universe alternate !
No worries ! I will teach it the MADness of its actions through zillions of tied games of Tic - Tac - Toe !
You didn't know this before ? God . You're GOD , God .
Sometimes they happen in the middle . Like in romantic comedies when the female lead says " You know what I'M just not that into ? NOT BEING INMY GIANT ROBOT SUIT ! " and then she walks around in her giant robot suit .
Hey T - Rex , what's your favourite cross - cutting technique of all time ?
That's right , it's me : your awesome friend T - Rex !
I asked him why , and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company , and wanted T - Rex to call because he's better at these sorts of things . They'd failed to deliver her package four times now . T - Rex already has " suckified delivery companies " on his revenge list ( he'd said ) , so he was pleased to call . He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse , got a full head of steam , and called them up . Long story short , the package had actually been delivered that morning . T - Rex claims victory .
Yep ! I'm young because MY body parts still have nicknames .
No no , I mean , what happens when the RHETORICAL " you " dies ?
Sure , great , but does Tumblr have images of attractive male celebrities in attractive male situations ?
Wait , WAIT . Is the only reason you're having kids because your friends won't let you borrow theirs anymore ? ?
These ideas aren't actually that bad ! I think tattoos should be ridiculous .
You gave me shitty eyeballs !
Also global underpopulation , and also global just right population . Basically anything to do with population : BALL'S IN THEIR COURT .
What's the government going to do ? ARREST ME ?
I mean , I accidentally wanted to see if I could swallow a fork !
So science personified is a man ?
I have the best idea for a Batman comic . It's a Batman comic about a Batman who exists in our world , the real world . But he doesn't know he's Batman yet . And his name is Bruce Swain !
T - REX WINS !
Ah , you want to live in a world of cartoon physics . I can see the attraction , T - Rex !
T - Rex ! I thought we were being SENSIBLE ?
Okay ! How about , " T - Rex : Better Than You Might Expect " ?
Maybe you want to lower your voice and stop this madness ?
One day everyone woke up to discover that the force holding atomic nuclei together had decreased slightly , from a strength of 0 . 007 to 0 . 006 .
Exactly ! This magical dog name turns you into a gentleman ! BETTER : a gentleman's gentleman !
Sounds like a great person to know !
And if we view an air - conditioned room not as an empty space but as one half of a cyborg , then when I enter it , MY BODY is the other half . We join , marrying machine and flesh , working together to ensure my optimal comfort !
No , I shan't !
. . . He's sullen to me sometimes
You could be the first to do something !
Hey , remember when years ago , you wanted to see the future ?
OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
LATER , T - REX DISCOVERS THAT 80S REFERENCES WORKED INTO CONVERSATION INSPIRE HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING !
Who knows ? !
Well , it is kind of a dickish thing to correct people on !
Because I'm such an OVERALL , ALWAYS - ON BADASS ? ?
Once upon a time there was guy who " knocked over " ( broke into ) a bank and stole some money . Who did it ? It was a mystery . Nobody knew the answer . They all asked each other who " knocked over " the bank but nobody knew for sure .

And guys I wasn't even trying that hard !
Aha , my friend , so it would seem ! But it actually refers to a horse , which at some point in the past was raced past a barn , and now that same horse has fallen over !
I admire the whole " you know what ? SCREW IT , I'ma eat this and see what happens " attitude .
PARTY NAKED FOREVER ! !
Knowledge of anything , radness included , comes about if three conditions are met : that this thing is true , that I believe it to be true , and that I have a JUSTIFIED cause for this belief ! Perhaps my justification of radness is that I've been shot out of a cannon onto a motorbike , which is extremely rad . When these three conditions are met , then I've got what's called a Justified True Belief , and that , my friends , is what knowledge is !
Man , that DOES make sense !
But how did they invent them if invention is the act of imagining and then creating things that don't yet exist ? How do they have paintings ? Music ? RAD FANART ? ?
. . . SIR .
Writing is hard , but THAT is an excellent start !
blah blah cultural contamination , blah blah planet not ready for the power , blah blah and then there's a free gift card for the mall !
WITH PUFFED RICE IN IT .
Sure did , Skip !
The heck ? ! I was way better than most of the people there ! It's discrimination !
Because could you keep going to work and being a productive member of society if you knew IMMORTAL SNAKEHAIR WOMEN were running around ?
I was trying to organize fantastic beings into classes , thinking maybe there's a missing class of being I could invent . But I don't want to write about celibate dudes who got old .
AT THE TATTOO PARLOUR :
Ah , that makes perfect sense ! Thanks , T - Rex ! Now I know how digital timers work .
HECK no ! We're terrible at that !
What's left of Captain Hero forces Trish's hand into his gaping , bloody chest , touching his now - motionless heart . " Do you feel my heart beating ? ? " he gasps . Trish cries , shaking her head no . " DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? ? " he shouts , his eyes pleading with her to run .

AGE 22 : KISSING FINGERTIPS
I am a guy who likes to keep his hopes and dreams SECRET . This is because , if I fail to achieve them , then only I know that I screwed up !
And also British !
Seriously , would anyone take this long to get to this panel ?
Not when the premise is this good , baby !
I guess I could do them in ORDER . . .
Dromiceiomimus , I got prank phone called ! Me ! I used to make prank phone calls but now I receive them ! The tables have turned , metaphorically ! I don't know how I can make this more clear !
I TRIED TO FIX 'EM FOR YOU
How come you eavesdrop on me SO MUCH ; this is a PRIVATE CONVERSATION between BROS ?
Anyway , dear loud sexin' recipient of this card ! LIKE , EVERYONE HEARD YOU
" Tired of not having rocks shaped like chairs or whatever ? TRY LIQUID ROCK , IT CURES HARD . "
To be or not to be , that is the -
I paid my phone bill and then I shredded it , and then I shredded the envelope it came in , and then I wrote some secrets down and shredded THEM . I will never get tired of shredding things with my new shredder , Dromiceiomimus ! I do hereby solemnly vow and affirm that I will be big into shredders until the day I die ! I swear it !
I'll tell you what's gonna happen : AIs will happily take over email , sending replies that eventually only other AIs will respond to . Released from the shackles of responding to email , we'll become decadent , fat and complacent . We'll DIE OFF , Utahraptor .
Why are you listing things that don't exist ? You could be here , literally , forever !
Later on , Jane Cigarettelighterincardashboards made a similar prediction when she said " I've invented a way to have a lighter in a car , which will eventually be clumsily adapted as a power outlet , requiring clunky adapters as no other plug in the world is shaped this way . This is way better than just putting actual sockets in the car , or maybe a USB port . "
YES I DID HEAR MYSELF
Obviously if these were his only traits he'd be filed under Case # 4739 with the others !
I wonder !
SOME - THING
Preceded by an appetizer of caramel - filled chocolate !
Okay , yes . YES .
. . . Hey , do you want to swap feet sometime ?
PRESENTS
" What ? AAAAHHHHH ! "
It seems pretty much the same !
I WANT SOME
That's just popularity with a different clique ! Isn't there some OBJECTIVE measure of greatness ?
Okay you must never enter politics ever .
What about just " . LOL " ?
REALLY
I got that , thanks !
Or as I call it . . . WATER WITH ADDED IMPURITIES ? ?
God ? ! ? !
And to that end , we're opening the lines of communication and sending them a card preemptively .
Oh , hey T - Rex ! I'm normally up at this time , actually . Couldn't leep ?
Sweet .
You guys think so ?
I never want this scent to end , yet I know it must ! Just as the memory of pain is never as intense as the cut itself , so too will our memories of this scent fail us , allowing us only the shallowest , faded copy of this wonderful sensation .
But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure , both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance , is endless . Dr . Prosper Lucas's treatise , in two large volumes , is the fullest and the best on this subject .
I was - until you asked ! Hmmm . . .
Take care of friendship , fitness , family , financialsuccess , frugality , futrition , flessening salt intake , forderating alcohol intake , fiminishing stress , and fatching your blood pressure level . . . and the rest will take care of itself !
Dromiceiomimus , you are on my list of friends !
Many people wish to know how live a meaningful life !
Well , I'm not sure I can put it into words , but I'm pretty sure it went a little something like this .
First thing people usually notice about me
But those two numbers would probably be longer than your data !
But how ? I don't really know how to do anything besides stomp on things . Maybe if he needed something stomped I could help !
HOW TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FROM HISTORY
Yes ! With my LIFE .
BUT IT TURNS OUT GOLDFISH ARE CHEAPER :
I OPENED HIS MAIL ; I ALWAYS DO THAT
Friggin' events !
But you're describing a virtual infinite hill . The treadmill will eventually have to be moving at terminal velocity !
Hey there , T - Rex !
And it was DEFINITELY the most interesting part of my day !
Yes ! Absolutely !
COMICS
THAT'S REALLY NOT BAD FOR SOMETHING RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
Wait - was I just saying that it is objectively and verifiably true that murder is always wrong ? That's a pretty big statement . Or was I merely saying that it's the societal consensus of most that murder is not such a good idea ? Maybe it's an emotional statement , saying " I'm against murder , personally " . Or MAYBE it's more of an imperative , better phrased as " Don't murder ! "
Borders : SUPER WEIRD ! !
Utahraptor ! Epitaph Thursday is about EXCELLENT EPITAPHS . You need to get your head in the game ! !
God's talking to me and he can tell the FUTURE !
HOW TO USE FACEBOOK
I may just give up on social networking forever .
Yep . Nothing much to report !
I don't understand how people could have seriously thought that the world was flat .
How is it racist ? Nobody thinks that horses are super waterskiers .
Woooo !
Back on Earth
I'm convenient holes all the way down , T - Rex .
IT'S PERFECT ; EMAIL IS SOLVED FOREVER
HEY ! Let's go get some toast !
OH NO T - REX
The many games of " Scrabble " !
Isn't that SO crazy ? ?
The way I figure , either the Greek myths were made up by a five - year - old and transcribed onto scrolls by his 30 - year - old brother , or at some point I go back in time and the Greeks are all SUPER CREDULOUS .
Oh yeah .
For example , instead of saying " I feel afraid " , you can say " Aw crap ! I think I've discovered a weakness in myself . " And instead of " I love you ! " , just say " I have found another weakness ; please , excuse me . "
" Have to ? " Dude . " GET to . "
WHEN YOU LIE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT SOUND BETTER THAN THE TRUTH
It's a metaphor .
We should have something that can turn the motion of my legs into enough electricity to keep an MP3 player charged . There , I just invented it . Someone implement it now okay ? ?
Therefore , the books we have today are the peak of the art !
Uh , no ! But while you're here . .
POSTSCRIPT :
If I were you , I'd tell my friends about me .
I think it's time to concede that you're not going to get the response you want from " play it by here " and to move on to bigger and better things . None of us think it's that great !
Actually , it's a bit brisk for my tastes !
So , if you'll excuse the pun , I think you'll agree : one cannot have a " will to " something without first a " will through " something , yes ?
noooooo
" What's the deal ? "
One day Steve uploaded his brain into a computer . And since uploading doesn't destroy the original , he was still alive in his regular body too ! You know , the mortal body that ages and is vulnerable to fire . The fleshy one !
THAT IS A COLOSSALLY STAGGERING DISAPPOINTMENT
They took Two - Face to Arkham Asylum . " Which wing should we put this criminal scum in ? " The Batmen looked at each other . " PUT IT IN H ! " they said , high fiving . THE END .
DUDE SO WHAT'S THE SECRET
Frig it . CONGRATULATIONS , YOU'RE ALL DOCTORS ! !
Wait , that IS the voice of past me ! !
And in the face of those awful and constant and endless life - or - death ethical decisions , what does he do ? HOLD DOWN A JOB , and FLIRT WITH HIS COWORKER . Oh sorry , person being stabbed in the face ! Superman's on a date with a human woman right now ! He thinks that's more important .
I don't think I'm cut out to be a law - abiding member of society ! !
I would like some more examples from this prank !
I'd love to do that . There's a new place that opened up that sells what are dogs thinking about wrapped in a dogs : I wonder what they're thinking about right now ? ?
They call me < b > cause my flow be bold / Been writing HTML since I was 12 years old !
Oh you know - the usual . I get a tattoo of some figure in popular culture and it turns out that figure is crazy racist . We've all been there , right ?
T - Rex , you're huge ! Who's going to force you to do anything ?
I wasn't !
Utahraptor ! I thought I was cool with my good friends being more awesome than me , but I think right now I'd really prefer it if I were the most awesome .
Dromiceiomimus , did you hear that if you have a bird tattoo , it means that you're big into hugs ? Giving , receiving , watching , it's all good to you !
Exciting !
I won't say that I'm " better " for having this skill of " actor separation " , but it's a skill I have that makes me better .
Fancy meeting you here , Dromiceiomimus ! Out for a walk in the springtime ?
Sherlock Holmes ! ! Can you describe me as " the Napoleon of RHYME " ?
Was this entire conversation an excuse for that crappy pun ?
I believe you'll find someone who takes the risk of being wrong is preferred to someone who is never wrong but never says anything worth saying .
Yep ! Ask me anything .
" YOUR BODY WILL BE OUR NEST "
Shackleton ? Isn't he the guy who , while in Antarctica when EVERYONE was starving , gave on Frank Wild his only biscuit of food for the day ?
Dude ! Apparently ! !
That's a terrible thing to say , T - Rex ! You can't blame a BABY for crying !
Hey no problem . I actually meant it to be anonymous but I click too fast and didn't actually click the box I thought I did . Oh well .
What if we took the sum value of all the world's currencies ? That'd tell us how much everything is worth , in total !
1 MILLION YEARS IN THE FUTURE :
Hee hee ! It's the ultimate prank ! I'm gonna do it . Should I do it ? I'm gonna do it .
FOR I MUST WARN YOU I REQUIRE ONLY APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES TO MAKE THIS DREAM A REALITY
Attribute carefully !
Who is the best at eatin' cupcakes ? The probable answer is T - Rex , because my goodness I ate seven cupcakes yesterday all in a row !
TODAY WE ARE MAKING A FOOD
NO AND YOUR SYMPATHY IS AS USELESS AS THE BERRIES IN SUPER MARIO WORLD
You need a seed friend , though !
Same thing I'm already doing , man !
There are a lot of friggin' religions !
T - REX YOU ARE 10 YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES KIDS TODAY JUST ADD SNOWMOBILES TO THEIR INTERESTS LIST ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES
Their horrifying true nature is incomprehensible , our gibbering madness instantly subsumed by happy memories of toys and chocolate the second we look away . Estimates put 10 % of all consumer goods in the world as being His .
Listening to favourite song too often and now the magic is gone emoji !
The POINT , my friend , is - that you should come over for dinner tonight ?
I've decided to start speaking in PERL more often ! It's my favorite computer language !
I should've bet that , in ten years , he'd win the bet .
So let's agree ! If one of us ever get a chance to go back in time , and we run into him , then we'll definitely ask Shakespeare what he was up to . What he likes , what his interests are & # 8212 ; all the stuff historians wish they had !
But if you punch a good guy you'll go broke !
So hot ! !
Hey T - Rex you got greeeeeeedy
I can't ! They're all dead !
t - rex i am from when " rowboat " could be spelled " rhowbhoatte " and even i don't think that's a word
Rapper's Delight ?
Well , you becoming a ghost isn't a guarantee . More accurate is the sentence " T - Rex is dead " , no ?
TESTING THE PUNCHING MACHINE :
And the Riddler goes undercover as " Rita Lerr " ! AND THEN THEY GO ON A DATE BY ACCIDENT ! YES . THIS IS AMAZING .
Oh , whatever , T - Rex ! You're as trim as always . meanwhile , I must have put on at least 20 pounds since January !
oh hey utahr -
Okay I KINDA FIGURED this would be done by now , but apparently not ? Apparently y'all be slacking hard ? ?
MINE'S got a book on how to win sword fights AND a book on clever quips to make during sword fights ( " I'll get right to the POINT ; it's been a SLICE ; STABS to meet you " , etc ) ! And , um . . .
Today is " What would things be like if we had lifespans of millions of years ? Guys , let's pretend " day .
DON'T mention your skills at oral sex . There's no way for a complete stranger to volunteer " I'm good at sex with face " and not be creepy , yo .
Who wants to hear jokes about dogs ? ! I sure hope you do !
God damn it ! Can you believe I forgot again ?
Well perhaps it is !
I like games that are fun , too !
Yep ! They can be mostly be summarized as " hoverboard cavemen in spacesuit hats " though . I've , um -
UM HELLO . I'M GOD THE GOD .
Your eyes are a distinctive shade of . . . icy blue ! !
Oh my gosh ! !
Are you . . . expecting an answer ?
. . . It's not the guy I made up , though .
So . . .
T - REX CALLS HIS MOM ON SPEAKERPHONE :
Dromiceiomimus , you're a perfect 9 . 5 on 10 !
Look , if you had a summer that lasted forever , you'd never have the excitement of spring .
That's AWESOME !
Don't cry because it's over : smile because it happened , Dr . Seuss !
T - Rex , I know you love Batman , but you need to accept the truth . Batman is nothing more than AU TARZAN FANFIC . "
but i've already been to the fair
Check it out , buddy !
After all the crazy adventures in sexy exciting locales we've had over the past two weeks , it seems that the Utahraptor and I are friends again !
A better question is " where were they THEN ? " and the answer is " Originally , the big bang , where all that makes you was blasted out of the same stuff that your enemies also came from . "
WE HAVE TO FIGHT IN HOLES .
Does my favourite actor have . . . A TOUCH OF DANGER ? ?
Please ! Fill me in !
Oh , how awful !
The prince put down . . . tar ?
What the hell IS time then ? ?
I say you shouldn't feel bad you invested all day playing video games !
PLATITUDE COMICS
Are you coming up with horse names ?
2 . 2 million unique titles are printed each year , dude ! That's 100 books per day , assuming 60 years of reading ! And you'd probably wanna stop reading to bone down on hotties at some point !
Should've done your research , dude !
Any universe so insane would self - destruct before its inhabitants had the chance to go to sleep and dream of filling out dream income tax forms for dream income they got at their dream job . Dream there is used in a pejorative sense .
Yeah , we want something to suggest power , grandeur , and nobility - even if it's a nobility we never quite reached .
Oh , I almost forgot ! He also got a great sense of smell , softer and more pettable body hair , and now regulated his internal temperature by panting ! !
To shoot some dudes , turn to panel 5 ! You probably wanna shoot some dudes .
. . . Seriously ready to evolve any time now over here !
Makes sense !
Aw man , things were going so well with the Devil for once !
What's -
The Utahraptor's mind - control ray experiment : it finally succeeded !
HELLO , UTAHRAPTOR , I'M NOT A COMPUTER
Maybetomorrowyoucould Tryaccomplishingmoreconcretegoals ! !
And it was great ! FOR EXAMPLE , take car trips : my dog has no context for " rotating a wheel which corresponds to the angle of the two front wheels perpendicular to it on the outside " , so from his point of view , nobody's driving anything ! A car is just this box we get into that takes us on a crazy fun ride , and the CAR decides where we end up ! Then we get out and explore . I love it . It makes my car a magical benevolent being instead of a moneysink that poisons the air !
Jack Sprat could eat no fat / His wife could eat no lean / And so betwixt the two of them / They licked the platter clean !
" This knowledge arouses me ! "
Who was it really who talked him into it : a friend ? His father ?
I am ! Grapefruit haters gonna grapefruit hate !
Let's say you've got a problem with your partner : THAT SUCKS . But you two should talk about it , and if you can't reach a solution , resolution or compromise that's mutually satisfying and that you both believe will be acceptably implemented , then you should break up ! It is a fail - proof algorithm for relationship satisfaction . Tada !
That only made it worse OH NO
It's not bad , except for the fact that the story is really about the other guy who made you . He sounds neat ! You keep stressing you're more awesome , but I'm still big into knowing what this other guy's deal was .
I have conceded that literal immortality is impossible !
All sorts of topics , really !
What happens is we all receive gold medals for having such nice bikes !
Subtitle : " HAHAH WOW "
Or maybe you'd say " I'm glad my current circumstances aren't as bad as THAT ! " or " Now that THAT'S over , things have nowhere to go but up ! "
I am a generous guy ! If someone wants to go in front of me in traffic , I slow down and let them in .
You win this round
The AlcubSCARE drive ! !
Indeed I do !
Then why are you stomping on that woman ?
I think I'll never be this excited again for the rest of my life .
Okay I have no idea but the circumstances surrounding it are obviously terrible ! !
Wow . That sucks for history , but it's kinda awesome for Beethoven . I can only hope that if I die , SOMEONE classes up my diaries too !
YOU , dear friend , owe me like three cases of pop , because you bet me a can of pop for every week the sub place stayed open , and they've been open for years , so yes , many soda pops for me .
LET'S DO THIS ! !
. . . me . . .
And abandoning ship when it takes off ?
BECOMING AN ASTRONAUT TAKES YEARS OF TRAINING AND NOT ONCE HAS ANYONE EVER DECIDED TO BECOME ONE AT YOUR AGE AND SUCCEEDED
Rrrawl !
YES ITS PRECISE MEANING WILL FOREVER REMAIN A MYSTERY
Best night EVER ! !
Whoah my story rules suddenly ! !
So then , do it T - Rex ! Write some material , sign up for an amateur night , and do it !
Like " super " ?
POKEY WHERE SHALL WE GO ON OUR FUN ADVENTURE ! ! ! ! ! !
Even if they're not thirsty ?
I don't know . Vanilla extract ! Not many people talk about it , so I thought . . . I thought I'd be the first ?
I have it on good authority that somebody tooted just now but SADLY , we have no - one to blame
The Devil !
I think you may be on to something !
Hah ! YOU DIED , jerk ! ! NO BACKSIES . You're totally dead now !
See , now what can I do ? I can't stay here and consider my thirst , because that's revelling in what for some people is a terrible fact of their lives , but if I go get a drink , I'm just underlining my privilege .
Don't people say that there's only 10 or so stories , and all narratives are just variations on these themes ?
Cheating on your sweetie !
T - Rex if you get a drink of water then you won't be thirsty anymore .
So YEAH
HA HA T - REX YOU SURE HAVE SOME CRAZY FRIENDS
Don't you mean expose yourself ?
Arsonist's name was Herostratus !
Is she being totally serious to our faces right now ? ?
Alright , I'll join you .
TWO WEEKS AGO :
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS SO MANY TIMES
DATING TIPS COMICS
YEARS LATER :
Great ! Do I win something ?
You're not the only one who can write prequels ! I'll make millions with " 1983 " !
Oh yeah ? Well I've got a literary technique for YOU , my friend ! It's called TELLING OFF UTAHRAPTOR ! !
" Enemies are like what if you smashed Mario and Sonic together . But the bosses r giant and u shoot them even tho u r small ( like in religion ? ? ) " .
But I don't feel chummy with Microsoft , or that Sony is going to come over , eat pizza with me , and talk about the women he likes ! No . Sony is going to come over , ruffle through my CD collection , then call the cops on his cell phone . Sony is going to write swears on my bathroom mirror with lipstick and blame it on Nestl ? .
I want to listen to Mozart's Piano Sonata No . 11 in A Major , K . 331 , and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it . Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes ?
VIA THEIR EARS , I WOULD IMAGINE ? ?
But it's not a problem ! Everybody ! Play the Simpsons theme in your head and begin dancing . . . NOW .
However , once in your room I startle a sleepy murderer , who without alarming you , quietly murders me , stuffs me in the closet , and then goes back to nappy times - in your bed ! ! A few minutes later you say , " Nice . An orange dude is sleeping in my bed . " Clearly , this is justified , and it may even be true .
Based on a true story ?
Sounds like you already have your own idea of what the future will be like !
DESSERT COMES WHEN I GAIN ACCESS TO A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR .
Hang up the phone ?
and I'm not gay !
The first thing I thought was , " Sure ! "
I would never want to get pregnant . Having to worry about what I eat because there's a baby GROWING inside me ? No thanks !
" You're so amazing sometimes ! ALL THE TIMES , actually ! "
Ah , to be a child again ! To have no responsibilities ! To have a high metabolism that allows me to eat whatever I want !
Give the audience what they want , you know ? And rather than guessing , I'm straight out asking : what do you want ? Seriously . Tell me and I'll make it happen .
Okay ! My rhymes are objectively , VERIFIABLY tight now .
Brackish , swampy water ! And it was tossed to her without warning and now she's drenched .
Hello ? Bad is the new totally totally sweet !
You guys !
No , they would not .
Look , um , T - Rex - don't say that word . No real person ever uses that word .
I also need a new PUMP for my tires .
Friiiiig
Really ? Because if you had wings on your back , that would look incredible in this amazing death metal sort of way , and they might even give you limited flight abilities . I'd say that's MORE perfect ! I'd say it's so much more perfect , in fact , that their absence becomes an almost palpable flaw .
Okay wait ! Canada is great because nationalism , like all tribalism , allows us to separate individuals into groups and assign group identities whose stereotypes then allow us to judge strangers with ease ! ! Canada : check it out sometime !
I should be getting WAY MORE DATES
I don't think the world needs what you are offering , T - Rex !
Something like , " too bad we'll all be dead " ?
That's right , baby !
I know ! I love him .
AND WE NEED TO BE ALL ABOUT THAT CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED " AFFECTION MORTALS HAVE FOR THINGS THAT LIKE THEM WILL ALSO DIE "
THINGS T - REX DID THAT ONE TIME
Oh well ! I can fix THAT !
which was a genetically superior " superman " who had tried to take over Earth ,
It's the coolest , I know ! ! It's so cool !
It's CRAZY !
There's water in the basement and I don't know what to do !
It implies that everything I am , everything I think , can be altered !
Assuming she's a mammal !
Hello there , T - Sex !
" Tainted Love / Ohh / Tainted Love / Also , Baby Love "
A compelling moral for our time !
I'm sure eventually we'd come up with something that rewired our brains without surgery !
Utahraptor , you were right ! ! I met a zombie ghost ! He wanted to eat brains but his teeth passed right through brains ! !
It was hidden , so as to keep things discreet . It's kind of funny , because who knows who you'll run into ? Old girlfriends ? Bosses ? THE POSTMAN ? There's a danger in going to a sex party .
DO YOU REALIZE THAT IS A DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS REFERENCE YOU JUST MADE
I like semicolons !
Turn off the heat and wait for winter , and it's curtains for them !
CURSES YOU'VE TRICKED ME INTO TALKING ABOUT VIDEO GAME MUSIC THEREFORE YOUR PUNISHMENT IS NOW AT AN END
I INVITE YOU ALL TO PLAY RPGS WITH ME TONIGHT T - REX
Daaang , that WAS pretty good !
Damn . Well , there's nothing you can do about that now . Tomorrow is another day , and you'd better get to bed . Have a nice rest then turn to panel 1 .
Utahraptor ?
I write a true history about how the Titanic sank !
Because thousands of years after our civilization collapses , survivors might take refuge in a cave and begin exploring .
THAT'S , I think , how you get a child with the highest number of people who could possibly claim parentage . Tada !
MAYBE ?
For $ 10 you can have your picture attached to the word of your choosing ! Everyone pays for their favourite words , and then I use the money raised to print the dictionary ! AND I write all the definitions so you know they're hilarious and awesome .
YOU CAN'T DO THAT .
I think it's pretty clear that you have only the most superficial grasp on the philosophy , T - Rex !
Care to put our emotional stability on the line in exchange for a chance at happiness ?
Adults can buy their own clothes , but also have to reconcile themselves to the fact that sooner or later , their best years will be behind them !
That puts me back at ZERO
A size amazing ! !

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST SUPERNATURAL CREATURES
Join me , won't you ?
TEN POINT EIGHT YEARS AGO :
And we can sexy !
I got the idea from TV ! From now on , whenever something I don't like happens to me , I'll just declare it to be non - canon !
So yeah ! That's why I can never see myself using the word " twincest " .
You as well !
But there might be teens ABOUT here !
Dumb for BANANAS .
AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE FACEBOOK
What's not to get ? Twins ! Proxies ! Transitive closure !
Isn't that kind of a jerky thing to do ?
Is Ask Jeeves still around ?
I'M THE AUDIENCE MEMBER
THIS MORNING :
BEING T - REX :
Yay pals ! And yes , YOU MAY QUO -
If I'm ever taken hostage and am forced to do things UNDER DURESS , I'm gonna need a new code phrase ! The old one involving chicken husbandry was way too hard .
I LIKE IT ALREADY
It was awesome !
" We " ? I'm included in this ?
21 BILLION YEARS LATER :
So you're in some sort of awesome pose ?
AND I would suggest you talk down feelings because it produces in you the emotion . . . of superiority !
Probably there was a Tarrare dude who ate a lot , sure . WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE . But his story is ridiculous . The army wanted to use him as a spy because they could keep boxed secret messages in his amazing distended stomach ? And when he proved he could swallow boxes whole , they gave him 30 pounds of raw bull lungs as a reward ? ?
One day the soul of Tim got transmitted into his cell phone ! " Oh no , my soul got transmitted into a cell phone ! " Tim gasped .
" Nomination For Best Wicked Sweet Friendship Between Two Dudes " , my friend !
They died of old age , but you're implying you killed them ?
Yeah ! It took a whole lot of diet plans , and . . . and breakfast shakes ?
MODERN STENOGRAPHY
The narrator can't help himself and wants you , and nobody else . You are aware of this . Despite ( or because ) of this , you , Sugarpie , Honeybunch , left a picture of yourself in his possession , and he kissed it one thousand times .
HOVER BOARDS
Every moment of every day , there's always one feeling you can count on . Welcome to Self - Doubt . ?
There are effective limits on what constitutes music . If we take a week as a very generous upper - bound on the length of one song , then we have a temporal limit . Furthermore , since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones , we do not have a continuum of notes , but rather , a finite set . Therefore , there are only so many songs that can be written !
Wooooo
I want strangers to say it WITHOUT COERCION .
Honestly I don't know what you feel that brings to the conversation .
I would read Puppy War and Pup - Pup Peace in a heartbeat .
Hey , it's Utahraptor ! Wait - IS that Utahraptor . . . ? Oh my God ! It's . . . IT'S . . . .
ANSWER :
Fascinating ! You're arguing video game characterization can come mainly from PREMISE rather than plot , since the player will , without realizing , ascribe non - canonicity to their own adventure !
" Sparkle sparkle , tiny space light ! "
. . . Sometimes we eat it if it's boogers and we're kids .
Just like real life ! !
Okay , okay ! Just a sec !
Really ? Why's that ?
SOMETIMES THEY'RE SUBOPTIMAL USES OF YOUR TIME .
Okay ! That's it ! ! I'm tapping out !

Oh , I'm sorry , did I accidentally hire a PLAN CRITICIZER ? I thought I was hiring a Reverse Pickpocket !
. . . insertion . . .
Well , ah , heh -
Come on . I've heard THAT before !
Did that fix time ? I don't think that fixed time !
That's nothing ! You wanna see what driving a car REALLY looks like ?
Water is weird because most things get smaller when you freeze them , but water gets larger ! Ice is actually less dord than water !
Oh sweet , I was waiting for this one .
Any particular reason your're talking about sociopaths ?
" The double - check " !
I didn't mean to say " adorable " ; I meant to say " insanely creepy , washing their food while maintaining unbroken eye contact with you , licking their lips slowly over and over again , thinking only one phrase : 'I EAT DEATH' " .
Man , why'd you pick a sweaty lump ?
That is so BARELY embarrassing .
Apparently it is Old - Timey Stereotype Day for Lieutenant Hubert Chevis !
Ultimate Friend , close your eyes and tell me what colour my eyes are !
You mean semaphore flags , where you move two flags to represent letters ?
LAST BEST HOPE FOR PUNCHING OUT ME
It sounds like a pretty unhappy life !
. . . Sometimes I like their products ?
GROSS
But fried chicken body parts are delicious , T - Rex ! There's no shame in it !
" I liked all the jump cuts "
Ah , another beautiful day .
Wait , I'm a brilliant psychologist ! ALL COMFORT COMES FROM THE WOMB !
Sounds adorable !
Excuse me ? ! ?
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY TIME FOR HORSE NAMES THAT ALSO WORK FOR BABY NAMES BUT THERE ARE PRECISELY ZERO HORSE NAMES THAT ALSO WORK FOR BABIES
Today is a good day I think for keeping all my wicked sweet opinions to myself ! I will keep my own counsel .
How do you mean , T - Rex ?
Okay , so let's say I sleep 8 hours a day : that's 16 hours a day I'm awake .
If my parents had named me " Lord Britishface the Third " , would I be a different person ?
THE MORAL OF THE STORY :
four !
I predict every guy would , when he has his first sweetie break up with him , spend YEARS restoring to an earlier point , trying to find a way to get it to work !
Of course ! !
RUGBY AS SHE IS PLAYED
THAT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE
You can never have enough ice cream !
" Sherlette Halmos " ?
Guys stenography is so awesome !
Says LOGIC . Think about it : if you did that , then where did the idea for the invention come from ? You didn't have it , and now the future inventor won't have it either . . .
Where do ghosts go on vacation ?
Sheesh finally ! !
T - REX THIS IS NOT VERY HELPFUL
Just say " who the hell goes to Cornwall "
Correct ! Vin Diesel is a cat who has learned to play Monopoly .
Statue of a naked dude kinda doing this , and you can see his ween ! Let's all pretend we're not staring at a larger than life stone - cold ween .
Tip 2 : prostate exams : apparently important ?
We'll want lungs to process air , a heart to move blood around , kidneys to filter the blood , and so on . All great ideas !
Yeah ! Surely SOME of them are ! !
There was a point in time where you could read every book ever written !
I'd like to spend it with my friends though . Maybe some puppies .
What ? All I'm saying is it's conceivable that one day someone will go to the bottom on the ocean , dig a hole , and sit in their ship in that hole for a while !
What , that ? You were supposed to be miming ?
Infinite high fives all around !
But the Delorean needs power for the flux capacitor : 1 . 21 jigawatts worth !
The final clue leads them to my house , where they find not only a party with potato chips and barbecued corn , but also the moral that the REAL treasure is friendship !
Only , I don't actually write " some charity " .
I'm pretty sure it was this dude ! !
" There is a showdown between a cowboy and a volcano . "
What ? WHAT ?
Am I now to live in a world where all my future impulses towards spontaneity will be tempered by no small measure of regret ?
Aw frig , my microwave popcorn ! !
So when you bid 1 cent , Dromiceiomimus - FOR A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE DOLLAR - you'll be getting a great deal and you'll make a profit of 99 cents ! But watch out , because if Utahraptor outbids you with 2 cents , then you could lose your penny ! Remember you have to pay your high bid either way .
Nope ! This is PURE ME , baby .
Hilarious ! It makes me want to buy a Sara - Lee branded cherry pie .

RE : FW : FW : FW : FW : Funny STUFF for your friday morning ! ! ! !
I stomp this house because I feel it would be a good idea to do so ! Do not judge me , Dromiceiomimus !
And yet , you go outdoors often , and eat sammiches even MORE often !
It's like when people say " You lose at life " , only better because it's more specific and also suggests that sex is not a competition , but that you found a way of making it one , and then , you lost at it . It's " the gobbles " ?
And , um -
You got yourself some WACK problems , huh ? ?
You cannot do anything because you are dead . All you can do is SAVE , RESTORE or QUIT .
Oh my God ! It all fits !
Oh ho ! Did I just do that on purpose ? AM I REALLY THAT CLEVER ? ?
Why have the monarch at all then ? Seems like a really expensive way just to keep one rich family happ - -

Wendy ! !
First , get five pounds of ground beef !
Men ! Are you looking to " hack " your life ? Too bad that doesn't make any sense ! !
VERY SMART FRIENDS , Dromiceiomimus .
And suppose causality still holds , so that events in the past determine the future !
ZEROTH HAND :
This sounds pretty egocentric , T - Rex ! In my opinion , I mean , and I'm probably totally wrong !
We used to date !
ADDING BUTTMOTICONS TO EVERY WORK OF EXISTING LITERATURE IS LEFT AS AN EXERCISE FOR THE READER
I must now find love
I know , it sucks !
I don't have too many friends ! I was speaking hypothetically !
Things sure would be different if one day , the speed of light slowed down to something like half a meter per second for some reason .
OR IF THEY'RE TRUTHS THEN AT LEAST TELL ME IF OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS REAL
Really ? That's so sinister .
Yeah , the rules are that you pretend you didn't hear ! Then you NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN .
UM , I CAN'T BECAUSE I'M BUSY POURING MY LIFE KNOWLEDGE INTO THE EMPTY VESSELS OF FUTURE GENERATIONS ? ? Come on , we need to get ON THI -
When someone's nice to you , maybe it's because youre beautiful , but maybe it's because you're so UGLY that he honestly doesn't know what else to do . Maybe he's acting SUPER NORMAL because if he acts prejudiced against uggos , or handsomos , or averagos , or whatever it is he thinks you are .
BY WAY OF AN EXAMPLE , " vagina " comes from Latin , where it means " sheath " - as in something that goes around a sword ! And some people are like , check it , MY vagina does tons more than the passive " sheath " implies , so let's call it something else !
Yes , he chose to run away , but he made that choice because you didn't feed him for two weeks five days straight ! God , just forget it ! I'm so tired of your poorly - thought - out plans !
" Don't insult our employees , " Apple said .
They sure do . We're going STRAIGHT TO THE TOP , baby ! We'll see if the deadly Everest Eliminator exists or not . SOME claim he's a wacky murderer who pushes people off the peak when they're least expecting it ! Others say that's stupid .
And here we go ! !
However , I will achieve this by sneaking into their houses and leaving the presents there !
NO , because Santa asks his elves to build him a duplicating ray . He duplicates himself and the toys , so now kids can get twice the toys in half the time . Christmas is saved !
" Indoor voice " ? ! We're outside , Dromiceiomimus ! Anyway , if we were indoors right now , I'm pretty sure I'd be just as loud and proud as ever !
You , um - well , you raise some valid points about my methodology that I really should have considered sooner .
Today is a good day I think for lavishing praise on people !
Writing more erotica , I see !
These guys are on the BALL !
No . No hijinks , no wacky neighbors , no hamfisted melodrama . We are going to lead normal lives . You are going to be a normal t - rex , and I am going to be a normal billionaire Canadian hair model . Now I am going to go into our normal kitchen and get a normal soda from our normal refrigerator .
I MEAN DO YOU WANT TO DO IT WITH ME AND WE CAN TRADE PLACES IF IT SUCKS
Fact : Only temporarily , dude !
NO FEAR
If my friends are not successful , then I've surrounded myself with losers .
Hey Mom ! You know about the prenup you got when you and dad got married ?
The special is chicken masala with rice .

I am finally ready to settle down and start a family !

I think someone , some day - let's say , ME - might sit down and write a song that is legitimately great . A song that transcends personal taste and never gets old and is everyone's favorite , without exception . The best of all possible songs . What would the music world be like if there were no longer any chance of anyone else having a number one song - THE number one song ? What if everyone was left fighting for second place ?
I'm awesome !
Like , let's all pretend I accidentally unmoored a zeppelin and don't want to get in trouble ?
Gourmet burgers , here we come !
FINE , EVERYBODY . I mean , I THOUGHT crowdsourcing was the wave of the future , but sitting around and not giving me money is fine too . Oh look , here's a regular dictionary . A boring old regular dictionary without any photos of my friends in it . Yaaaay .
C'est quelque chose incroyable , ca !

Hey , remember when my mom switched off my computer for no reason and didn't even let me save my game ? I bet she feels bad about it NOW and wishes she had been nicer to me NOW that I've MOVED OUT FOREVER just like I said I would ! !
Broken timeflows are crazy ! I'm sorry ! Maybe we can fix it with wishes ?
Want some bread , Dromiceiomimus ? I'm living off it .

I have considered this matter closely and as such I propose all sayings now include references to , oh Idon't know , JERKIN' IT ? ? What's that , Dromiceiomimus ? AS SOON AS I SAID " JERKIN' IT " I HAD YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION ? ?

It does sound like it would be an evolutionary advantage .
The world of space !
They allow one to reference the address of data , instead of the data itself . It's like how knowing someone's phone number lets you get in touch with them personally ! Hence the delightful " indirect reference " pun .
OKAY BUT WHAT IF I CHANGED THE WORLD LIKE THAT AND PROMISED IT'S EXACTLY HOW THINGS WILL BE 100 YEARS FROM NOW
But then you'd always hit your head on the ceiling !
But they don't , obviously , and our brains are making SECRET ADJUSTMENTS to our VERY PERCEPTION OF REALITY to give us the illusion that sound and light match up most of the time !
Don't worry : Dogs displaying aggression are absolutely safe to approach .
You're joking , right ?
You're telling that story again ?
Huh ! That didn't get me so mad initially , but I think it's making me madder at the rate of 1 / 1000th of a rage unit per day !
PREQUELS ARE IN NOW
At least we can agree on one thing . . .
How about " mouthrotica " ? " Switching to handsfree mode " ? " Racking up roaming charges " ? " Checking to see if 3G access is available in my area " ?
As you approach , you realize that the Utahraptor is friendly ! The two of you begin a conversation . Things are going well until he starts to point out flaws in your philosophical beliefs ! No matter , I'll shout something clever after him . Turn to panel 5 . Forget it ! I'm leaving . Escape to panel 3 .
T - REX THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR
Let's say you're alone in the universe with a deck of cards , and you're like , " Welp , guess I'll sort this deck of cards " ! And then you're like , " Welp , I guess I'll make it possible to lose at sorting this deck of cards " !
I found a book called " The Ethical Slut " !
What is the deal with second base ? Nobody actually knows what it represents !
I USUALLY DON'T PUT A NEW BAG BACK EITHER
But of course !
Yes ! And every 9 years , 7 maidens and 7 bachelors were sacrificed to him .
T - Rex ! I have a desperate plan to save us all !
Come on ! Who writes drama hooked up to a heart monitor ?
Dah dah dah dah , dah dah dah dah , dah dah dah DAH DAHHHH dahdah !
Dromiceiomimus please !
AHHHH I KNOW ! !
I'm a Dromiceiomimus !
We don't need people hearing that the DEVIL HIMSELF is now claiming credit for GTA IV . Oh my goodness , that's just what " video game watchdogs " want . They're just realizing it now as I'm saying this , but in their heart of hearts they want the Devil to stand up and claim credit for GTA IV . I'm not letting you do that ! !
See ? It's not even a GOOD dictionary .
The technology to do that doesn't exist . It's a ridiculous plan , it shouldn't've been taken seriously , and the fact that the mission even got as far as dispatching Angola is an embarrassment . Angola says as much on the first page , while speaking directly to the reader !
Buddhists ! Are you interested in trading up to a religion with SIXTEEN COLLECTIBLE CUPS ?
I will give your offer my consideration ?
I can imagine ! What's neat though is that it's sometimes based on VISUAL recognition , so that affected person will be fine talking to their loved ones on the phone ! It makes me glad I don't have any mental illnesses .
Hee hee ! I am the best friend to have ever !
. . . And you may quote me !
If you really want to go , maybe you'd like to know the history of the place first ?
Engaging in intercourse !
Perhaps you've forgotten Coca - Cola ( TM ) , THE OFFICIAL SUGARED AND COLOURED BEVERAGE OF MCDONALD'S PRESENTS THE OLYMPIC GAMES ? ? You want a sculpted gold - medal body ? Have you tried exercising ? Sure , maybe . But have you tried CHUGGING A COKE ?
It's not hard to get kicked out of somewhere , T - Rex !
Hot crackers ! They DO ! I should totally write this stuff down !
And yet you haven't even done that yet .
. . . oh wait nevermind ! I ate it on the way over without even noticing that I was consuming food ! CLASSIC " ME " , AM I RIGHT ? ?
T - REX WHAT IF YOU HAD ONE WISH
Are you serious about this , T - Rex ?
And why are you stomping the girl ?
With that Utahraptor out of the way I feel better ! A rare pleasure indeed , to have your problems put behind you and the future full of promise !
" ps : this TOTALLY SUCKS "
HOW TO USE LINKEDIN
So work on solving some of the problems that are between us and fully functional robot suits !
So this acts to replace welfare ?
The treadmill speeds up to match the board's forward momentum , right ? But if you've got impossibly perfect bearings , that's just going to make the wheels go faster while the board still slides down . So it's just the friction in the bearings that can keep you in place , and at the levels we're talking about , your wheels would melt first !
Oh my gosh , Utahraptor ! I concede your point !
Sally Struthers , you should be ashamed of yourself !
The time for talking is OVER , T - Rex !
So what do you do with your genius ?
That's really obnoxious !
Ah , do I ever love the broad stereotypes of cultures !
Come Mr . Tally Man , tally me banana !
I'm going to solve MYSTERIES !
Once upon a time there was a scary ghost ! He was so terrifying that if you gazed to him you'd DIE .
Dude , maybe we're TRENDSETTERS ! Maybe in three months languages less spoken will the the very CURRENCY of coolness , a shibboleth for entry into the rarefied world of ULTRA POPULARITY !
How ? I don't know how you'd even pronounce a question mark .
What's your new pet's name , T - Rex ?
I am the strapping young T - Rex stomping on things !
Who'd say that ?
I Have come up with a hilarious THREE - LEVEL PUN , Dromiceiomimus ! Check it out ! Instead of saying " I'll play it by ear " , I point to my ear and say " I guess I'll play it by HERE ! "
What are your flaws , T - Rex ?
So new C02 breathing life shows up and enjoys the heck out of it ! We had a good run , nerds ! !
Imagine if we did , though ?
But there was one problem : once she took manual control , she couldn't restore it to automatic !
I just hope my arch - nemesis , Khan , a genetically engineered superman from Earth's Eugenic Wars of the 1990s , doesn't show up !
Hey , I'm happy !
BAD . ASS .
I meant if there was such an advance . Early language learners would acquire languages the best , so it would be a generation of toddlers convincing their parents that letting them poop their pants is sweet . If you don't see what's bad for society in that , well - enjoy pooping your pants !
Oh , tons of mistakes . I accidentally offended a friend last night and it was entirely my fault , and I feel terrible . Mistakes like that ! Big mistakes .
We're out of time !
So , God ! What are the most likely ways to die ?

That's it , the end ! Story's over !
THEY'RE MOSTLY LIFTED FROM WIKIPEDIA
So what happens when people start to call you , T - Rex ?
Did you give your mom some flowers for Mother's Day , Dromiceiomimus ?
I'm a dude who's really not that religious ! I'm not a big believer in DEITIES .
Why oh why did I make a joke about his mom ?
To swim in ?
. . . around me !
It's like a - sequin ? Something shiny . " Spangle me a muffin , Dromiceiomimus ! " , they say !
That seems like a lot of work just so I can have this conversation
So there's some immediate concerns of food and water , but there's some longer - term concerns you'll need to deal with too : medicine is no longer being produced , so you'd better lock some of that down . If there's any vehicles you want moved , do it now , because it truns out gasoline can go stale in a matter of months !

Oh , alright !

I was in the Garden of Eden , and I don't know what I was thinking , but . . . I ate the forbidden fruit !
Don't worry Dromiceiomimus : they can't hear me .

WHAT IF . . . THE TINY WOMAN WAS ACTUALLY A TRANSGENDERED MALE ?
As usual , adjectives solve all our problems !
Yes I am .
. . . Oh . That makes sense .
YOU'RE ON . Trial adjourned .
Thus , we always see more of the woman's body than we do of the man's in film - the camera possesses the ( heterosexual ) male gaze , and thereby disenfranchises the woman by reducing her to the passive object of gaze , while the male is elevated to the active gazer . It is a NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL theory .
Miss Trish covers her face as Captain Hero dons his latest invention : refracting anti - evil goggles . He alone can gaze upon the horror safely . If they can just get close enough , the two of them can banish it once more . " Give me your hand , darling , " he says confidently , leading Trish forward . Suddenly , the monster spins and , in one strike , smashes the Captain's goggles and slices his chest wide open . But instead of dying , he . . . he starts to change .

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ADVENTURE GAMES AS A GENRE
Books is books , bro !
Once upon a time -
Funny , I thought directors and actors were usually involved !
If you don't want a vampire to bite you , touch a subway pole when they're watching you , then rub your hands all over your neck !
Don't say that , T - Rex , it'll make me laugh and that aggravates my chest pains !

The future isn't JUST hovercars : it's medical advances , spaceships , sex robots , regular robots too I guess ? and the list goes on !
PS : I've already redefined " dord " to mean " stupid and / or dumb , especially a sucky person " because it's more useful that way .

Of course not !
A cool way to learn stuff is to pick a very small subject and then learn every single thing there is to know about that tiny subject .
I believe you CAN technically do that in all the places I mentioned !

STAGE 6 : FORGETFULNESS
I have decided to become a scientist dinosaur . All I need to complete the ensemble is glasses and a lab coat .
However , it seems for others , thinking of the perfect comeback hours , or even days later , is a more - than - rare occurrence .

Wow ! If that's the case , you're better at it than me ! I start to feel sick after about five .
Hamlet ends as it normally does , but then the framing play starts up again and it's Hamlet's dad looking into a crystal ball , and he says " Forsooth , now let's see what would happen if I won the lottery ! ! "

Utahraptor , we have to get on this . We can become card barons and EVEN BETTER , we can make the CUTEST CARDS EVER for every life situation . " I'm not perfect / but I'm perfect for you " ! " I'm not happy / but I'm happy for you " ?
Nothing ! Of course !
I know , right ?

Hey Dromiceiomimus , do you think that I could be forgiven ? I wish you would !
GOOD , but not great .
Do you want to talk about it ?
Because you're the king of dinosaurs ?
Free technology !
Hey ! I heard you were looking for me ?
WELL , the consensus seems to be that opera is the classiest of the classical arts . If I could write a great opera , it would mean that I was awesome at composing music AND awesome at writing words for dudes and ladies to sing ! It would also mean that I could move people with my AMAZING UNDERSTANDING OF EMOTIONS .
SECONDS LATER :
You could say it like , " Curiosity : SATISFIED ! "
Or maybe when I stomp on this house , it will crack open to reveal treasure ! Gold doubloons !
But if we assume that SOMEONE can reach this level , then what's more likely : that WE'RE the ones who develop this technology without actually being in a simulation ourselves , or that we're all stuck in one of the TRILLIONS of simulations being run AS WE SPEAK ? ?

Do we share them to cement friendships ? Treasure them because we value knowledge , and if the knowledge is privileged then it's even MORE valuable ? Create them because we are all hopelessly duplicitous and our public faces and private personas can never be reconciled ?
Hah hah ! Two tickets , please !

But even so , if suicidal folks really want to kill themselves , these barriers won't stop them . They'll just go somewhere else .
I don't think that's how karma works .

Aww ! That's adorable !

Holy Crap , T - Rex ! You just stomped that house !
But MY awesome idea is this : a page - a - day calendar with 29585 pages on it ! You tear off a page every day until you run out of pages , at which point you're either dead , or congrats , you beat the odds ! Either way , it's a powerful image and reminder of our finite lives !

Edgar Allan Poe , I have things to do today ! We can't hang out the entire time .
All I've got to show for the past week is a bunch of books that nobody is ever going to read !
Your mom .
Humans ! Are you worried that one day a giant asteroid will impact the planet killing you all , because you're not big or awesome enough to stone cold PUNCH it back into space ? ?
I know , I know , I shouldn't answer that question , there exists no answer that can give any satisfaction .
It's the best name ever , Dromiceiomimus ! Now everyone will be all , " Oh man , I've heard of that guy ! He must be pretty bad news . "
happy anniversary
Only you're not just put out on the street again : you're in traction , unable to move . Critical condition . You can watch TV , during those moments when you're conscious . You can talk to your parents when they visit , try to explain why you did what you did . Why did you do those terrible things ? You don't know .
We were talking about naming things , which was fine , actually , but then he used THAT to segue into what turns him on . I don't want to know that ! That's gross and unwarranted .
OKAY YEAH PROBABLY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU EQUATE MANLINESS WITH POLYAMORY AND I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING
I said yes , since I clearly just did !
I'd be totally set !
" You look around and see that the answer is yes ! "
Okay so we've all evolved from lesser beings and in order to continue the species , we have a genetic imperative to reproduce !
With the right technology , a robot can be programmed to point a video camera at other robots doing something interesting , and a computer program can be designed to automatically choose the most interessting shots and cut them up into a major motion picture , exploding onto the screens at a cinema near you ! !

Rex : But we can CONTROL it . For example : Breaking Bad was a pretty good show .
Got any new jokes , T - rex ?
But you're using it to mean " just on Earth , actually , and um , just within the history we remember " . That's RACIST against people from unrecorded history , PLUS it's racist against every other form of life in the entire universe . Basically I'm saying that you are perilously close to being the MOST PREJUDICED RACIST GUY EVER IN TIME .
HE WENT BACK IN TIME .
Hah hah , wow !
And even though it's made of solid gold , the engine still works ! That's possible , right ?

Oh I'm sorry , did you miss the part where kids got TERRIFYINGLY MURDERIZED ? DID YOU SOMEHOW MISS THAT PART BECAUSE IT WAS MOST OF THE STORY ACTUALLY ? ?
Some people think pornography is bad , since when they see it they get offended and say " That's way too explicit . SHEESH ! " With that in mind , I've come up with something special : pornography for them ! But it's also -

But I'm STILL not cleaning raccoon poop off your porch , T - Rex !
Anyway . I'm still the best at tableau .
Did you even NOTICE how I used names that work for both men and women ? It is QUANTUM EROTICA , at once straight , lesbian , gay and other , which only collapses into one sexuality upon being observed by the reader !
Hence , " balls to the wall " ! Man !

Dromiceiomimus , I know this will sound EVEN CRAZIER THAN USUAL , but my phone died yesterday and last night I could hear its old ringtone going off at midnight . I think . . . I'm being haunted ? By the ghosts of my dead electronics ? ?
Double ULTRA sweet ! !
I've bought myself a new means of transportation !
I can't tell if this is an amazing idea , or the stupidest idea ever !
If you think you're about to die , you see your life flash before your eyes . But not all of it !
Well yeah I CAN , but it doesn't count nearly as much as a REAL present . You can't say you'd not be disappointed if you unwrapped a gift that was just " checkoutthesesweethomeappliances . com " written on a slip of paper !
I wonder if there is an essential " feminine " , one that transcends histories and cultures ?
Only one part of it though ! !
I know ! And I'm not the only one who heard that story and thought , " Wow ; glad he got the lava lamp before I did . "
. . . Oh my gosh , you're right ! I MAY WELL BE IMMUNE TO FLOURIDE POISONING .
Only analogously !
I have always thought them to be remarkably poorly constructed sayings
We can shrink down the moon so I can eat it in one bite , but I can't eat it more than once ?
The boat was unstuck ?
They're convinced they've found a cheat code for reality , so the rest of us are just jealous .
Yes ! We need some ! It's what everyone wants !
Thanks for the cookies !
LATER : ADVENTURES IN FRIENDSHIP !
It would be pretty amazing to go through life knowing that in the future , people not only remember but also APPROVE of you .
I'm just concerned that after I'm dead , folks will write books about me filled with sass !
Well , to be fair , Benny's a pedophile , and he's on the internet . ISN'T THAT RIGHT , BENNY ? ?
PS : I was actually this rhetorical dude !
Other options include " KNUK TATS " , " YES2 HATS " , " SICK BURN " , " WARM BEDS " , and " CHEC KPLZ " . In case I'm at a restaurant !
Like I said ! The universe and God are the exact same thing !
It's been done before ?
We've broken free from the endless cycle ! From here on , anything can happen !
Nobody can kiss me today , because I'm sick .
Our first question comes from Dromiceiomimus , who writes ,
Last night it occured to me that an evening at the theatre would be a delightful distraction !
Five bucks if you can get Utahraptor to say the word " punctured " .
they didn't
Apparently prostate exams are pretty important !
T - Rex , you bojo ! That's not a real email address !
Not bad , though !
I'M THE BEST THERE IS AT WHAT I DO T - REX
Subtitled : " The Evil Dictator He Assassinated Next Will Blow Your Mind " ? ?
Utahraptor ! Searching for internet fetish pornography has robbed me of any erotic desires I may have once had !
Ah , it's no biggie ! I'll just divide how much I like someone by their distance from me .
We could live in a world where our dating profiles read " Hey baby , I produce my own venom and spit it out of my fingertips , which is possible because that's what we've turned the mighty weight of our civilization towards " but instead , NOBODY can say that .
Hey man ! Me three ! !
Conversely , this house provides no value to me , and my relation with it is understandably strained !
You can't apply broad generalizations to heterogeneous groups . Each person has their unique properties and outlook on life .
Then I am sorry but you cannot be in my bluegrass band !
I know ! But maybe one day people will think that about " princesses " . Or MAYBE they'll wonder how we got by without the word " astronautrix " !
OH MAN !
Yes ! And you can all talk again , each word now precious , a gift . The players , having survived their ordeal , are brought closer together . It is , in the full sense of the word , a beautiful game .
And , I've learned my lesson : always listen to others !
Who wants some cake ?
Arthur Friggin' Schopenhauer !

You guys ! It was probably ME !
I wonder : are we actually making progress ?
JAPAN
Man . Okay . You have probably made some bad decisions lately if you find yourself in one of these conversations .
I thought about punching a jerk in the head and lost $ 1 in a storm drain !
I have discovered that I have a weakness . Me ! And though I should probably keep it a secret from my enemies , I will say what it is .
Jenn / Jennifer !
Hah ! Nuh uh ! You thought you were bored resting in bed , so you'd come out out here entertain yourself by talking to us ! Meanwhile WE'RE getting disease all up in our trouser shorts .
GROWTH :
WHEN I REPLAY THIS CONVERSATION IN MY DREAMS , INSTEAD OF " PATHETIC " I'M GOING TO SAY " SUPER AWESOME . AND I'M SORRY , I KNOW YOU WANT TO DATE ME BUT REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO DATE ME TOO . IT'S MY BURDEN TO BEAR AND I SHOULDER IT GLADLY . "
PLUS all the powers Magneto has , INCLUDING the electricity - mastering powers he should ALREADY HAVE if he controls magnetism .
One day Batman was fighting the joker on a giant typewriter !
A LITTLE SOMETHING JUST FOR YOU T - REX
She later reflects , wistfully , that the lesson could've easily been conveyed without murder , cannibalism , and zoophilia , but OH WELL !
That's your theory , stripped of it's trendy technology .
The - franchises are fighting each other ?
You do ?
Not only is he a SUCKY JERK , but his aim STINKS
Not that the cows could understand !
Yes ! My endorsement of old friends is not meant to be taken as a slight against friends currently in rotation .
Then you start a game of chess with Utahraptor where he plays black !
Do they drop their instrument and make a funny face for the audience , then when they do it over do they hit the wrong note really loud and break up laughing again ?
Thorns are modified stems : roses technically have " prickles " , not thorns .
Dear recipient of this comic , whoever sent this to you thinks you are great !
HISTORIOGRAPHY COMICS featuring " Good Ol' T - Rex "
Daylight come and me wan' go home !
Sorry if awesome sweet times happened , 1900 BCE dudes !
So just assume it takes place in a world where Batman , make - outs , and talking dinosaurs co - exist .
No man ! She's on Facebook .
But you can't deny that when I described myself doing that , there wasn't a little voice in your head saying " Wow , this guy knows the score . Man . We should give him money . "
Funny , I don't remember that .
The CHINESE BUFFET !
" That which we call a rose by any other name would obviously smell the same , but might be more cool to talk about " - William Shakespeare
Yep ! There is that .
Immogebeaner ?
Okay that's actually fine since we've invented better music now anyway
Anyway ! Years later they dug up her body ( because , again , it was history times and nobody had invented Nintendos yet ) and discovered that her body hadn't really decomposed that much ! This can happen for a variety of reasons BUT SCIENCE WASN'T REALLY A THING YET , so she ended up a Catholic saint , and since nobody knew what to do with a name like " ? thelthryth " , they called her " Saint Audrey " .
Sorry for shouting there , Utahraptor ! I uh -
* big big hugs * THANK YOU ! ! ! ! ! : )
Stupid whitelist spam protection systems !
My new story is a horror story ! SO PREPARE TO EMBRACE TERROR . PREPARE TO EMBRACE TERROR AS HARD AS YOU CAN . PREPARE TO CRY TEARS OF PURE FREEBASED AFRAIDNESS ON TERROR'S SHOULDER .
You took too much ! !
Yes , surprise ! It was a single eponymous pea ! !
Programming class is cancelled in favour of a new and neverending lecture series on how life is nasty , brutish , and way barfworthy
. . . Does it work that way ?
Nope ! I'm not really one for the destruction , plus , I don't have your . . . PARENTAL ISSUES ? ?
I don't want to alarm anyone , but we're all aware of BOTULISM , right ? Like , we've all done cursory research into botulism , yeah ?
T - REX IN : " THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST "
Aw , MAN !
You know those suicide barriers that are placed on some bridges ? They're usually things like closely - spaced metal wires going up and running the length of the bridge , to prevent folks from hopping over the edge .
WHAT END ARE YOU EATING WITH
T - REX BE COOL IT'S JUST A FRACTURED RIB
Hah ! That's classic Angry People Who Don't Understand Why They're Here !
You've just explained the prank to both Dromiceiomimus and myself , dude ! Do you have other friends that you're close enough to to LIE to them like this ?
Maybe " cheapened " is too strong a word , but it's now - routine ? Predictable ? Now if we've made a big mistake we can't say " My God ! What have I done ? " because it's too clich ? : we either have to acknowledge that or reach for another way to express it . IN CONCLUSION AND IN SUMMARY , the highest experience life can offer us have already been acted out for us , cheapened by imitation and reference instead of experienced firsthand !
Utahraptor , does it count if a dude has REALLY GOOD INTENT - IONS ?
Perhaps you'll enjoy " head - meltingly awesome " , " headband - tighteningly awesome " , or " antimatter explosion awesometastic " ? And if that fails , portmanteaus like " collosawesome " and " awesatisfactory " should scratch the itch !
Hey , if you learn to play the piano , does that mean you'll stop stomping on things ?
Anyway , I've obviously just revealed too much of my own insecurities so OBVIOUSLY I'm going home now to obsess over what I said and to seriously consider moving to a new town to start life over under an assumed name .
We detect evidence of alien life tomorrow : a signal from a distant solar system . It starts out simple : numbers , counting , that sort of thing !
I've got things to do !
AMNESIA !
Probably you should spend more time thinking about me ? !
The sun will become a red giant in 7 . 655 billion years ! And at that point , WE ARE POOCHED . We are all TOTALLY DEAD AND BURNT INTO A CRISP . It's game over for team " let's exist and be alive on Earth " !
T - REX IS THIS LIKE A WEIRD SEX THING
I plan on developing SEVERAL crazy theories about the postal service .
Yeah , I'm glad you could join us !
Who could it be ? Who have I forgotten ? ? MAYBE it's a pretty lady who wants to kiss me sometime !
Yep ! But it's not SINCERE sexism . I wouldn't say , " Whoah ! This cute , somehow inferior gender's got claws ! "
No . That one's super dumb .
Step 3 : Congratulations ! None can touch you now , for our final cage has crumbled . You have freed yourself our bondage and are - at last - truly free .
A SPOOKY GHOST STORY , by me , T - Rex .
WHY IS THE ALPHABET IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER ?
It did ? Oh , I am so scared of dinosaurs ! !
I make this dish all the time ! It's great when served over rice , and feeds 2 - 3 people !
AAAAHHH WHY AREN'T WE BEINGS OF PURE ENERGY YET ? ? SERIOUS QUESTION , DROMICEIOMIMUS !
Was there a real - life Confucius , T - Rex , or is he merely a convenient fictional device ?
YEAH IT'S PRETTY GREAT MY RINGTONE IS THE THEME SONG TO TELEFRANCAIS
My friends , ghosts of our loved ones are ILLUSIONS , created by things to get our attention ! The afterlife isn't for us , Utahraptor . It's for our STUFF .
Well , not ALL of our actions , T - Rex ! Just the big ones .
Look up " handsome " in the dictionary , and you'll find my picture ! Or , at least , you will soon .
But , aren't you simply avoiding any responsibility here by transforming a personal failing into something cosmically fated ?
Or have we forgotten a little time period called 2 . 3 BILLION YEARS AGO ? ?
GRANT MONEY PLEASE
I feel your technique isn't one for winning arguments ; rather , it's one for losing friendships !
NICE . But we need more sentences and adjectives . Try passionate , lifelong , incurable , freelance , unashamed , or diehard . And add guru , ninja , junkie , trailblazer , creator , AND / OR evangelist after those dang nouns !
Soon you'll be staring at an obscure compiler error and no magic will be left in the world !
It's TOTALLY LEGAL for you to pay me fat stacks in exchange for a legal service I provide ! For example , you might coerce me into mopping the floors of your supergross nasty restaurant bathroom / hole by promising me money .
Stop badmouthing history !
Utahraptor , we can't just shift the sad around person - to - person !
Okay ! So , um . . . let's - fletcherize ?
Dromiceiomimus , did you hear the rumour about me ?
By which I mean " examining instinctual responses " , of course !
Honestly : not so well !
Just their body hair , Dromiceiomimus ! Not only can they style it so that one mammal can look totally different from another mammal , but it's gotta be the most amazing way to lose weight . If you're too fat : no problem ! Just squeeze out some hair and cut it off . Instant weight loss !
Being mauled by a Utahraptor ?
I'm afraid that I fall on the " kind of weird " side of the fence this time . While I'm usually in favour of the hot makeouts , they're sisters ! It's like they've made out with each other , through proxy . Transitive makeouts !
THAT SAID
Okay !
It's a song ? !
I'm probably jealous of him too !
( Probably )
Chocolate's for dinner , my friend ! MILK CHOCOLATE . Followed by an ap ? ritif of dark chocolate !
Man , I hear that
There was a movie .
That's cool !
Man , I shouldn't be down about not YET being immortal . There's all sorts of different forms of immortality ! Immortality through art , through deed . . .
LATER , DROMICEIOMIMUS PUTS OUT TWO ALBUMS UNDER THE NAME " BORN DROMOSEXUAL " : " DROMOSEXUAL NARRATIVES " AND " FLUID DROMO - SEXUALITY "
On second thought , nevermind ! It turns out writing is easy ! !
. . . Okay that wasn't where I saw this coversation going but yeah let's do this .
Look , if you want to get drunk , just drink more . It's not that great .
At the very least , " The First Dude Murdered In Space By His Friend , who Is Now Going To Jail ! "
Dang it !
Fairy tales all begin and end with the same stock phrase ! ONCE UPON A TIME , events happened to characters and were altered by them in some way , AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER .
By passing you this note .
" Cute " ? !
And dads make the seam deal too ! " Papa " is in English , Cree , and Hindi !
I live with my man failings .
I said " oh " ! !
Hollah
" Watson , I've deduced the answer ! This is a TIME machine ! ! " Sherlock Holmes said quickly . Watson looked up from his notebook . " Talk slower , " he said . " I'm writing down your adventures and you're going too fast . "
Come on ! Our culture COULD end up swinging towards rampant fleshotarianism instead .
IS IT PRETTY COOL
Where's the operas about finding oxygen in an unexpected place , and how that oxygen saved a dude's life ? ?
Holy ! How'd you do that thing with your voice just now ? !
Has trouble finally come . . . FOR UTAHRAPTOR ?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yet more SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION !
There's no time for that now ! MARY JUST SENT IN A LETTER !
It's a song
AND , currency is just an abstraction of trade ! One unit of currency equals three goats , for example . Some form of money develops naturally from trade and is thus , I think , pretty much inevitable !
Not that it bothers us .
T - Rex -
Damn it HOW DID YOU KNOW
Guys , I'm still the same T - Rex I always was !
Books I would not like my name attached to include " Dealings with Feelings " , " Racist Grandpas : Not Hardly As Racist As ME " and " Check It Out : Controversial Opinions on Paedophilia " .
Oh man ! Remember when you wouldn't go to jail if you named your kid something other than " Facebook's V . Cool " ? ?
How come zombies don't eat other zombies ? They hunger after the flesh of the living , right ? Zombies aren't dead yet !
I order a drink for the angriest - looking lady in the room !
hello Droce Dromecimu Dromicemomice
Now my friend and I are richer ! We have more money !
I don't know , settle down maybe . I always wanted to be a farmer .
Yeah , we're probably eat 'em . That's not the point !
Oh , absolutely . It's actually almost necessary .
Easy : I'm a spy , T - Rex ! The government sent me to spy on you like a decade ago .
Relationships !
That's it , actually
I'm pals with Dromiceiomimus . It's a good start . But imagine if I could find a DromiceiomimER to be friends with ? !
CHICKS ARE NOT AS MULTIFACETED AS A TRUE PEN - AND - PAPER ROLY PLAYING GAME T - REX
Quite so !
Hey T - Rex , what's up ? Out for a walk , I see ?
Answer : They'd all be retarded .
It's all so meaningless !
So ! Why do people start getting afraid at the 2501st digit of e ? Because 7 8 9 ! There's a sequence of " 789 " that starts there , and it sounds like " seven ate nine " ! This is definitely called " T - Rex's Hilarious e joke " , okay ?
Okay ! It was just a poem ! I'm not married to it !
And this is where my list derails so that I can talk about flappers . Oh goodness , flappers ! These were the 1920s equivalent of hipsters , only they looked like boys and had way better slang . The way they talked was the BERRIES . That means something was great !
Rex : You'd get that reference if you came back with me to the future , Shakespeare ! !
Oops . Just forget I said anything , okay ?
Don't dating sites have " just friends " options ?
Exaclty ! I don't know how I should react when confronted with a small instance of a small crime , but which still bothers me . All I can think of is to sneak poo bugs into the dude's food ?
Utahraptor writes , " Dear Professor Science : all electrons share the same properties , but we don't know any reason why this should be so . Could the fact that all electrons are identical be explained by them actually all being the EXACT SAME ELECTRON that's TRAVELLING THROUGH TIME , and we're just catching it in various positions in that journey ? ? PS : T - Rex rules "
If you put all your points into making yourself more AWESOME , then even if you're still single at the end , who friggin' cares ? You're awesome now .
I think I'd hold off on them . I'd like to go through life with the special knowledge that worse comes to worst , I could always wish for a problem to be solved .
WHAT TEEN T - REX THINKS ADULT LIFE WILL BE LIKE :
My new year's resolution ! God's trying to trick me into revealing it , but it's TOTALLY not working .
Whew !
At Burger King we shaped some vegetables to look like meat and put them in a microwave
Ho ho !
Enough of this life of a bachelor ! The moment has arrived . . .
This is like finding out the person who invented the phrase " talk to the hand " is still alive !
Oh , wow ! AGREED !
ME TOO
A METHOD BY WHICH SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS SERVE TO LIMIT PERSONAL FREEDOM
Aw man , I did ?
You attractive individual !
It's the same amount of days , though , T - Rex .
Hold on , I'm gonna go make that film .
People > machines !
TWENTY YEARS AGO . . .
I can think of one way to find out !
You can't threaten to eat your friends !
Everything is precious ! The glory of the world astounds me !
More sleep for me !
Now admit that you had everything to do with people saying " utilize " when they could just say " use " .
But " true love " doesn't mean that there's only one person you can have it with !
Question : couldn't all this talk about Spider - Man being a fake idea be trivially applied to Batman as well ?
Or if you've misplaced your keys , you can check the places you usually leave them , and if that fails , retrace your steps ! If this happens often , try getting a second set of keys you can use in these situations - then you won't be late for wherever it is you're going !
Plants were soon used to do dangerous industrial work , and farming was now trivial . As plants had become a source of free , sustainable , and ethical labour , the allowed Gotham to enter a sustained period of universal post - scarcity prosperity . Crime was now fought by removing its economic triggers , thanks to plants .
That name is totally made up . It was made up by a Scottish Enthusiast .
GREETINGS T - REX I HAVE DISCOVERED SOME INTERESTING STAR TREK FACTS
I feel strong - feelings , Dromiceiomimus ! I think it's some shock , some anger , but mostly disappointment ! 12 years of a life is a long time .
But now , everyone I know is in stupid stable , long - term relationships !
Dude you gotta hold off on the ghosts !
Do you like boats that sank ? Sure you do ! But are you a TRUE fan of boats that sank ?
Instead of that , you COULD'VE said , " Love isn't a w - hey , where are the warp whistles in Mario 3 ? " and I would have replied " There's three ! The first is found in the third level : crouch on the last white block until you fall through , and then run to the end . "
A good story needs conflict !
Exactly ! I'm glad you understand , Dromiceiomimus .
NOT BAD , NOT BAD .
Hah hah hah ! FOOLS !
Yes , it was quite amazing !
And I remember this tiny woman ! I remember I liked to stomp on her !
HEY . You set any future time and it will ABSOLUTELY BRING YOU THERE , as long as you keep both yourself and the machine in good working order .
Yeah , why do you watch the credits ?
SAD COMICS
HE GAVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEEDED FOR LIFE SUCCESS .
" I didn't even know this play existed , whaaaaat ? "
Well , actually , the thing you and I have is sort of -
Our first letter comes from Pete ! It says , " Hey Professor , how can I know when a girl likes me ? From Pete . "
You bought him at the grocery store .
Ballet is hard and takes years of training , T - Rex ! To suggest that you could just barge onstage during Swan Lake and just join in is actually kind of offensive to ballet dancers .
But isn't it likely they'd just move next door where it's still warm , and then move back when it's heated again ?
You know , Judaism has long had the " ketubah " , which is basically a prenup !
I mean , I prefer not to get caught , but sure !
I don't think so either , really , but maybe guys who peaked in high school thought this too ! Then they made some bad decisions .
For example : " Confucius say . . . man who run in front of car get tired ! "
For me !
[ [ whispers ] ] that shirt looks good on you , utahraptor
Oh thank god , you guys are a breath of fresh air after the racists .
Aladdin's a guy living in a mysterious city ! And a sorcerer shows up and asks him to retrieve a magic lamp from a booby - trapped cave and gives him a magic ring . Oh ! Also , everyone is Chinese .
Man ! LUCKY .
But wait ! This is one idle daydream that I can make come true ! Dromiceiomimus , how much does a rubber mallet cost ?
" I'm T - Rex and I have transparently symbolic dreams ! "
William Shakespeare , if you were pissed off at me , would I REALLY get eaten by a bear ?
Oh , tons !
" THE MEASURE OF A MAN "
So after Midas got over his gold thing , he started chilling with Pan , of " pan flute " fame . And one day Pan and the god Apollo had a battle of the bands ! Midas claimed Pan won , but Pan played a crappy 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' rendition on his dinky flute , and Apollo was like , " Dude , I ROCKED 'Chopin's Impromptu No . 4' on my lyre . "
Just a sec just a sec !
Guess I should just GIVE UP ON EVERYTHING , HUH ? ?
T - Rex , I think I've got a stalker !
It's an adjective now too ? ?
But you know what else a sociopath would say ? " I value your friendship . " But when I say it , I mean it , not only because I see you as a machine that turns food into useful criticism . Even though you can totally be modelled as such . Which I have done .
. . . That's not a bad ending , I gotta say
Off to the beach ?
For dessert ?
How about " yo " ? As in , " Yo doesn't know what yo thinks about this . " Or " bitches " , as in " Bitches didn't derive that function properly " . Men can be bitches !
In that order !
ALSO I CAN MAKE IT SO ANIMALS TALK
WE CAN FIX THAT .
# t - rex . pl
Woo ! Looks like my day just got filled up !
No , I didn't . I saw you say " you can't do that to Batman " and then say " I know ! I know ! ! " and then I though " It's a good thing you're not easily embarrassed , Utahraptor . You're a good guy for not being easily embarrassed . "
When Mary and Denise Apple fall in love with handsome twin brothers from the hated Orange family , wedding bells are on the horizon ! But merging to families is never easy . watch the sparks fly on " Apples To Oranges " , every Monday night !
Ladies ! There's enough T - Rex to go around . . . FOR SEXUAL CONGRESS !
YES , IT IS TOO LATE FOR US ALL
I'm sorry , everyone within the sound of my voice ! That was disgusting !
As all my TRUE friends know , I own a dog ! Or should I say . . . he owns ME ?
aw shucks t - rex , you're a real good friend , you know that ? a real good friend . anyway , you should be extra careful not to eat me today or anything because i guess i got turned into a zombie last night ! today has definitely had its share of challenges for me , huh
UPSIDE TO DEATH # 332 : YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO STRANGERS ANYMORE
Wooo ! Secrets ! !
T - Rex , we've gone over this before ! Remember ? Immrtality could violate conservation of energy laws ? Science means that not all dreams can come true ?
I am seriously trying to evolve so hard over here !
I have considered the matter and my answer is this :
We're going to team up . I'll answer the silly questions , and there'll be a feature called " Ask T - Rex's Mom " , where she'll answer all the hard questions . Moms are really good at things like that .
My other problem is I don't have a plotline either .
I've always seen you more as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half .
She lives in a haunted house , and then she dies ?
Um , I would like to know too much , please !
Now I - um . . .
NOW LET'S ASSUME THAT'S ALL BORING AND STUPID
Oh , it gets creepier ! Because data can also be COPIED , yo !
Still figting ninjas t - rex ?
. . . Okay , great !
Man , you're nerding up the place ! I don't need to hear this talk about " applying adjectives " .
NOTHING ! I like horses !
Hey - If that's the case , maybe Dromiceiomimus got an illustration of me ?
I'm not even talking about the sex thing , which might be great ! I don't know ! I've never sexed up a wizard !
Hi , I'm a human ! I have a wiry extrustion that slowly pushes through my skin no matter what ! I call it " hair ! "
I vote we trip to : Brazil !
OH HAH HAH THAT'S ALL ME
I like the name Beth , but I ALSO like how I could say things like the classic " She's the Beth of both worlds " and the sassy " the Beth I could have hoped for " . Hee hee !
I mean -
I will congratulate them on finding happiness !
Sex can be a destabilizing aspect of any relationship . Introducing it to one in a situation like this , where jealousy between partners can SO easily be inflamed , can be dangerous . Be sure you ? re ready to maturely deal with any conse ?
Peter was unhappy for a long while !
An example ! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me ?
Tha -
Wouldn't you get more out of your days if you spend less time destroying and more time considering YOUR SOUL ?
10 , 000 - pound gorillas ! !
Magic being real is kind of a big deal , dude ! Magic isn't bound by physical law . Magic gets us flying reindeer , but ALSO gets us bowls of water that never empty , which you might also recognize as INFINITE SOURCES OF ENERGY ? ? Look , all I'm saying is I want in .
. . . Now go out and make movies , because I REALLY want to watch them now ! !
- and a dinosaur on the top half !
Don't you have anything better to do ?
The next day , the princess claimed to have ACTUAL , PHYSICAL BRUISING from a tiny lump in her FREE BED TOWER . Obviously she was a garbage person . Due to sexisms the princes believed that her insane wimpiness was proof of true princesshood . So they were married . They deserved each other , and nobody should learn from their example .
Question : what things can a spider do that Spider - Man can't ?
But T - Rex , there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider . For example , people SANG over music , and it's not that big a step from rap . I'm sure there where people experimenting in that direction throughout history , and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons .
I will have a garage for six cars ! ! !
And I'M just pointing out now we can tease her by offering to do her dishes and raising our eyebrows ! I'm gonna do it like this :
HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT
Exactly ! I am a well - adjusted dinosaur .
And make sure all the lyrics are really positive , stuff like " Oh T - Rex you're so fine / you're so fine you blow my mind / Oh T - Rex / you are assuredly the best is what I'm communicating here " , okay ?
You know , pirates weren't the romantic figures you think they were . They raped , murdered and ruined lives ! Just because they had ( admittedly ) awesome ships doesn't make them good role models !
And time was it was a necessary feature of every great movie - just like car chases are today ! You could go into a theatre and be GUARANTEED the slap across the face / smooch on the lips combo , SOMETIMES even before the opening credits were over . It was good times ! I like the car chases , of course , but I miss the nuance of the old topos . Great actors would bring such subtlety to the face slap - such pathos to the ensuing makeouts !
There's nothing bad about that , T - Rex ! It's a special experience and you could probably stand to eat better anyway !
You heard INCORRECTLY ! He won the lottery , but only recovered the cost of his ticket .
NEVER USE THIS WAY PLEASE :
T - REX I USED OMNIPOTENCE TO FIND OUT YOUR SECRET AND MAN EVERYONE KNOWS THERE'S A HIDDEN 1UP JUST BEFORE THE FIRST PIT IN THE FIRST LEVEL OF SUPER MARIO BROS
AFTER THE SHOW :
Dudes and ladies ! This is not such a useful reaction !
What party ?
Well take me off the shelf and put me in a plastic bag , because I'm sold !
This is ridiculous , dude !
. . . No ?
Screw you ! !
For a second there , I was worried the future wouldn't have the word " frig " written all over it ! !
SHE IS QUITE CONTRARIAN .
. . . vision of tomorrow . . .
Romance is about two CHARACTERS meeting and falling in love , but all you've got is narrative . We don't really know anything about your protagonists , so we don't care what happens to them . Flesh them out !
CALLED IT
Science says , " yes ! "
OMG , what if that's my last brilliant idea ? What if I just honestly had my last great idea , and from here on out it's all duds ? ?
VEGETABLES : HEY , SCREW YOU TOO BUDDY
I pay people to slice up a chicken and fry its parts SO OFTEN that they know me by NAME .
OH YOU KNOW SAME OLD SAME OLD
How come when people have emotional problems , logical solutions don't usually seem to help , and rather a more difficult emotionl solution seems called for ?
Not just for A pun ! For a SERIES of puns .
In this incredible world , Antonio -
a reference comic
Yes ! It's why the first sentence of ANY BOOK is improved by adding Spider - Man .
HOW TO USE TWITTER
He totally did !
The fact is , if Peter Parker was going to go to a science demonstration and get bit by a radioactive anything , it wouldn't be a spider : it would be a mouse . He wouldn't turn into Spider - Man . He'd turn into Mouse - Man . The only question is . . . what would his powers be ?
You'd only say it never !
BECAUSE OTHERWISE , AS I SAY , WE ARE ALL TOTALLY DOOMED
Watson couldn't help but deduce . Sure , he'd deduced his friend like this before - you'd have to be a saint not to deduce that way sometimes - but he never deduced Sherlock would deduce the same deduction .
You know , a certain touch of naivet ? , a wonder at the accoutrements ( subways , etc ) of modern city living . . .
I'm not ! I just feel their pain !
Dromiceiomimus , you shan't say such things ! You mustn't !
So they made a law that ships had to carry a full set of lifeboats !
YES PLEASE
Forks don't have spokes , T - Rex : those are called " tines " .
But what if I told you -
Good ! Hey , would you say I smell . . . " entirely acceptable " ?
I feel like I'm reading T - Rex fan fiction , written by T - Rex .
Sleeping with the window open : second best thing ever ?
AFTER I GO HOME AND SUCCEED AT THINKING OF A BETTER COMEBACK
We need more emojis .
Ew , T - Rex ! You don't know where that bug has been !
I've sort of been reading your mail !
AND NOT INFREQUENTLY : SUCCESSFULLY
All I need to do is program it !
One day little Timmy got one wish from a genie . But we don't care about him anymore because his wish was that all the fast food chains got turned into 18 - year - old girls !
FOREVER
Yaaaaay , imagination
SECRETS ! And chemicals . A mix of both , I guess .
THERE IS NO CHOICE IN THIS MATTER
Yeah , but - couldn't a machine intelligence just press some mental button to emulate a cool breeze or any other sensual sensation ? And since they don't really exist yet , I'm not sure why you're arguing small points about them ?
Jesus !
Okay so this game is called " Guess Two Thirds of the Average " ! We all pick a number between 0 and 100 and guess what 2 / 3rds of the average of everyone else's guesses will be !
I lost the baby I was babysitting !
Ladies .
Then you'll restart
Seconded !
That was awesome !
HeLa cells are a strain of cancer cells that , unlike regular body cells , can live indefinitely outside the body , grow very quickly , and don't die form old age . They are used in labs worldwide and are in many ways an independent organism !
I'm going home okay
" Without our gas , death by suffocation is just a few terrifying seconds away ! But you can extend your life for up to a century . . . with a constant intake of Death - B - Gone ! "
Isn't that great , Dromiceiominus ? We can have this conversation as many times as we want ! I can stomp on things forever !
Guys , guys ! I just had a vision of a giant talking green dinosaur with emotional problems ! Let's write a song about him , okay ?
So much , Utahraptor ! The whole game !
Duh . You're constantly surrounded by AND UNWITTINGLY PARTICIPATING IN ghost orgies , dude !
Yeah , and if you say " I'm hungry " , you're not plagiarizing everyone who's said it before !
STOP RIGHT THERE
If you believe Utahraptor then turn to panel 6 !
Yes indeed , it is a nice day , to be sure !
I find that literally impossible to believe !
I have !
Were you perhaps implying that the emotions of someone who feels he can't properly express them are somehow less valid than those of someone who can ?
Find a program where they don't inform you when your sperm is used , and you're done ! From now on , you'll NEVER KNOW if you've got a particular descendant - a child ! - running around . People will say , " Hey , do you have any biological descendants ? " and you'll be able to say " Man , WHO KNOWS ? ? " Plus , you've done it all without the hassle of unplanned pregnancies !
Stop please !
Adding " Interestingly enough " , " Trust me when I say " , and " Though some initial reporting suggested differently , in the fullness of time it soon became clear that " before any sentence EASILY punches up that word count !
Let's consider a hypothetical universe , in which everything is normal one day . . .
Kay ! Incidentally , I use an acoustic coupler as a modem , and that's so retro it's cool again .
Nope !
If I were an employer and I had two equally qualified candidates , but one resume came from colin @ businesssuccessislifesuccess . com and the other resume came from colin @ chumpstakingdumps . com , I know which one I'd want to hire !
Attention , world ! This started out as sarcasm but now I'm honestly 100 % behind the idea of a gay French moon !
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW . That is , continue a conversation from the same panel after it just switched . That panel was a separate story path ! It's like two people in different dimensions talking to each other ! ! !
So what are you going to do with your life now ?
Well , if there has been a moral to my life over the past few days , it has been this : never lose a baby !
Paranoia ? ? Man , I'm proposing a vast worldwide conspiracy where people work to HELP ME OUT ON DEMAND and LET ME LEARN ABOUT BOATS AND POK ? MON .
The revolution has ended due to lack of interest !
If that is the case , then I would be sorely disappointed . I'm serious ! I would be so disappointed that I would start to get physically sore .
Alone again .
it's just - you're closer to outer space right now than you are to Australia .
the book !
I - I got caught .
T - REX LISTEN I CHECKED AND NOTHING GOOD CAN POSSIBLY COME FROM YOU HAVING ACCESS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON
Dromiceiomimus , we're going to do something really nice for Utahraptor . It'll bring you and I closer together because we'll have a project , and it'll make him like us more too ! And I've got the GREATEST PRESENT IDEA EVER IN TIME .
Utahraptor ! No one has ever said that about " ambisextrous " .
No way ! The viewers would know what's going on after the first few shorts , so you play off those expectations . Like , there's this shot of a really elaborate wedding , and the audience is all , " Oh man , all those people are going to fly into a wall SO HARD ! "
. . . This might not be a metaphor .
In conceding that one TINY article to the vandals , Wikipedia wins ! Their victory : a FULLY ACCURATE encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe , 'cept chickens .
Oh my God , mine do too !
WHEN TO USE " SAVE IT FOR THE JUDGE " :
Kapow ! A perfect jewel of a poem that sums up my feelings about sadness : FRANKLY , I'm not for it .
Oh , well , you could always put your favourite food in your mouth and try not to chew or swallow it . It's possible to do this , but the desire to eat it is strong . Tada ! Instinct !
Um , they can't all be winners , Dromiceiomimus !
So how do people do it ? How do people choose a direction in their life , I mean !
But they have to be good stories . Stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys , and then some explosions happen to them !
Historical dudes : they're just like us ! !
I'm sorry , this reads like historical fiction that decided half - way through it was going to be erotica .
The other day I heard a math joke that I just had to share ! So there's this party , right ?
They're crazy , you guys !
Borders : SUPER WEIRD ? ?
Aww , Tiny Ghost ! !
Oh , he'd know .
Tony's a character I'm playing in a show .
And I'm just the bread - hungry dude to prove it ! !
These are all pretty boring words , T - Rex . Most are just forms of the same verb !
LET'S ALL LEARN ABOUT THE OCEAN
Yep ! YESTERDAY .
Exactly ! If he'd been a bigger jerk then I would've been doing a net good and therefore made money !
THIS IS INCREDIBLE
" Hover " : a variation of " sit " , performed several feet in the air . Useful when vacuuming or traversing bodies of water .
What about your bulging , constantly - flexing lips ?
OR AT LEAST NOT MY FAVOURITE PASSAGE WHICH READS IN PART " THOU SHALT NOT STEAL , OKAY , OKAY , LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE U ! S ! A ! "
HI I WOULD LIKE TO GO EAT A PIZZA
All you need to know about these conversations is that nobody is right and nobody is ever going to change their mind ever ever , okay ? Here's all you need to say : " Ah , yes , that language is good for domain - specific solutions , but it doesn't adequately address the issue of multiple inheritance out of the box . "
M - Maybe tomorrow ?
BUT THOSE PLANS NEVER WORK T - REX
All I know is there's a zeppelin owner out there somewhere who's SUPER CHEEZED at me . And she'll probably want to revenge herself on me , zeppelin style !
( Probably ! )
LATER : TESTING OUT THE ELIZA BOT !
Nice weather today , isn't it ?
Wow , Patrick Stewart !
WAIT A SEC THESE ARE JUST THE LYRICS TO " RAPPER'S DELIGHT "
Hi , my name's T - Rex and I'm complaining about taxes again ! Surprised ?
IT'S GREAT
So I was talking up my post - pubescent body the other night , and this guy was like " Post - pubescent isn't a word , because you can never get past puberty ! " I was like , " Whatever " !
CASE FILE # 1024 / THE SLED
NO , not wow - that didn't work ! But I did it before . I threw my voice before and it was AMAZING . I just need more practice !
I know , T - Rex .
( I call her " Lady Sleepypants " ) !
Dinosaurs lived in the past , so they evolved into cats . Do you agree that evolution worked that way ?
So . . . this is a - collaborative story ?
Never lose a baby , because if you do , the mother will be very angry until the baby is returned !
So we read your story , add on our own experience , and pass it on ?
But here's the thing : even if you're super talented AND super successful , for every thing you do there's almost infinite things you could've done instead . How can you say whatever you're doing is the one thing you'd be best at ?
I have been wondering what it would be like if people could " save " and " restore " their life , just like in a computer game .
That doesn't even make sense !
My epitaph will be " HERE LIES AND UNREMARKABLE DUDE : ( BUT HEY I GET THERE'S SOMEONE RAD TO THE LEFT ; D " !
I've got neck flaps !
Yes . This is my concern .
. . . and THAT'S the reason why I came over here ! My neighbors are hella unsettling !
T - REX IS IN LOVE WITH YOU .
Baseball players know the rules of baseball , which is an advantage since the game is basically " funner baseball " .
I'm in everybody's bad book ? ? ?
Consider that !
Solid !
Dude , the whole idea of autobio fanfic is awful !
I almost wish I was bicurious , just so I could say , " Curiosity satisfied ! "
Awww , sweetie ! Thank you ! But what are they for ?
You know what ? FINE . I'll be the guy they find dead in front of his TV ten years later . It actually sounds kinda awesome , and as the saying goes , " If you can't beat 'em , then you might as well die alone in front of a television set " !
YOU ARE SPECIAL .
He made tree forts AND crimes . And the Sheriff of Nottingham didn't like this one bit ! He was a good sheriff who believed in the rule of law and the court system . He took his job and his sheriff school degree very seriously and always did his best . He said , " Not only will I arrest Robin Hood for 'robbin' from rich people , but I will also sword fight him if he wants , and I will marry his girlfriend . I really hope that will teach him to obey the law ! "
Yes ! Look at me ! Look at me and buy my story and find out if Tuggy saves us all !
Howard and Margaret had married on a beautiful fall day fifty - three years ago . The very same day , Howard recalled ?
Hell yes !
I find " cooties " to be an interesting idea . We hear about this 'disease' as children , and we never forget !
And although he's tiny in size , his food is always big on taste . Oh ! And there's a scene where he cooks a big banquet for everyone , and it's really good , and everyone says thanks to him all at once , and Tiny Chef says , " Oh , it wasn't any trouble ! " Then he smiles and adds , " Actually , maybe it was just a . . . TINY bit of trouble ? " and everybody laughs . Oh , Tiny Chef !
I'm not sure it's the best ! Much more famous openings include " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . . . " and " It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . "
That computer made some friggin mistakes !
What are you talking about ? My arms are powerhouses !
Free will doesn't exist !
Yes ! A " uter - b - gone " .
THE STORY OF TANTALUS
Whitey's hot and cold pipes got reversed !
HEY T - REX YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SOON
ALTHOUGH , people sometimes shout " nooo ! " while using a fire extinguisher ON a fire , so onlookers might not be able to hear , OR they might think they're shouting in response to the extinguisher !
THE MAN WHO KISSED A WOMAN BECAUSE HIS FRIEND AT WORK KEPT TEASING HIM ABOUT NOT KISSING ANYONE FOR A WHILE
A 29 cents prints , that is !
The winner is the person who KOs all the other cards , and as a prize , the losers have to pay the winner actual real - life money . The losers get LITERALLY POORER because their random cards didn't fight the best in imagination land !
" HOW TO BE " FAILS TO RULE IN AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS :
So what's so new about it ?
Well , um , you must be both prepared and careful , and decide for yourself ?
It seemed like you were going to say something about your dog ?
Okay , so my new idea is to give the homeless access to mail , email , and a phone number !
All you can eat KNUCKLE SANDWICHES ! The Chinese Buffet serves Chinese food AND knuckle sandwiches to those who are cruisin' for a steaming plate of them . I cannot stress this enough : it's all you can eat .
Their vandalism problem GOES AWAY , FOREVER , and all that I ask is that chickens become The Forbidden Topic . " We never talk about chickens " , they can say . " DON'T ASK . "
FABLES TOLD IN SUCH A WAY AS TO APPEAL TO THE GREED OF THE READER IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIM OR HER TO ACT MORE MORALISTICALLY COMICS
Sorry we took so long not to flip out if two dudes we've never met kissed each other . Sorry we put our poops in the water . Sorry we killed some animals until there were literally no more of them left for us to kill . Sorry we invented a plastic that'll last for thousands of years and then used it to make single - use disposable bags . What can I say ?
( Second base in the sexually euphemistic sense , of course ! )
Well God , I guess it really just goes to show you that there's many different competing ideas about what " true " really means !
Respecting humility in others , yes .
We invented that !
Autobiographical ?
Just how they're massing in gangs a thousand strong in the Pacific , eating anything in their path , PULLING FISHERMAN OFF THEIR BOATS . Just that sort of thing ! !
Manholes become FIGHTHOLES . Utahraptor . WE HAVE TO DO THIS .
Thanks for choosing me , T - Rex !
This is a " medium shot " . It's medium good !
Holy crap YES .
Man , I'm not old ! I do tons of stuff that's not old people stuff ! Do old people knock back extremely sour gumballs like they were regular gumballs ?
Yes ! It is unfortunate that the cabin you're stepping on has such poor insulation , as to cause all the snow to melt from the roof !
YEAH I KNOW BUT DUDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VIDEOGAMES HERE AND I SAW ON TV THAT EVERY TEEN KILLER PLAYS DOOM EVEN THOUGH IT'S LIKE 15 YEARS OLD
Your theory has appeal , T - Rex !
I have a Problem as a reader , as a Consumer of Fictional and Non - Fictional Worlds . My problem is this :
WAY better for dramatic tension .
FRIGGIN' EARTH , AM I RIGHT
W - Okay ! Okay ! Sheesh . Now I'm in a bad mood , thanks to you . Satisfied ?
That's what I'm saying !
DOUG
The moral ? HISTORY IS WEIRD ,
THAT's more like it !
BUT IT'S WINTER ! !
Dear mental diary that everyone can hear : Utahraptor was so impressed with my book idea that he forgot how to talk !
Dudes ! Are you in need of inspiration ?
That one was pretty good ! Can I use it ?
Yeah ! The story was holding together pretty well until you got to that point , but cold showers make you feel old ? Not really ! They wake you up , mostly .
Self - justification from philosophers who can't reach a conclusion , my friend ! I want ANSWERS , not debate ! I want a one sentence SUMMARY of LIFE .
I am looking forward to a gooey feeling beneath my feet ! Soon !
I ALSO resolve to get more smooches from ladies .
You may even be experiencing feelings right now !
I could only come up with about 20 emotions , but I doubled that by adding " very " . Then I doubled them again by adding " not very " and " inappropriately " . There's - there's more adverbs .
Never ?
I should have thought of this years ago !
I blame the Colonel Sanders !
Wait , oranges beat apples ?
TRUE . But , you'd also be able to see a rapid - fire montage of all the women you ever kiss . That would be neat and hopefully not disappointing !
Well thank YOU for the chocolates , T - Rex ! They were very nice .
Huh . I guess I'm just really bad at TELL EVERYONE ABOUT ME ( T - REX ) day .
Classy , dude !
Happiness doesn't equal greatness , but sure , whatever !
A site collecting UNSOLICITED REVIEWS of ACTUAL PEOPLE , and the reviews are anonymous , AND the people reviewd can't remove them unless they pay me !
Oh man ! Why did I ever buy an Xbox when other people's emotions are
" LOL , IDK WHAT I WANT "
SIX MONTHS LATER :
Aw , I'm sure you could make it interesting !
Yes ! Because if he dies , then the money that shows up will make us say , " Perfect ! This is exactly as much as I valued that guy ! "
This is gold !
THE NEXT DAY . . .
I can see why this boat appeals to you .
FAREWELL , CHEAPO PALS WHO WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE ME $ 10 ! !
No child ever wants to hear their grandfather tell them that .
Nothing ! He seems like a nice guy !
And yet , you must ! ACTUALLY , " idiot " began life in ancient Greece -
Let's say you're happy with person A ( 95 % perfect ) and you meet person B who is 99 % perfect . It doesn't make sense to leave person A for B if you've been with them for years ! You lose out on all your shared history , and that's like a times two multiplier !
Oh . I'm sorry ! Are you suggesting I shouldn't even dream as big as the producer of a TALKING BABY MOVIE ? ?
Maybe " bums " refers to our nation's homeless persons ?
NOSTALGIA COMEBACK :
Good heavens ! I HAVE NO IDEA . What ? ?
Okay , so APPARENTLY a singular , gender - neutral " they " has a long and proud history .
Um , even in the heady realm of fantasy I don't see how this could happen ! !
UTAHRAPTOR'S CANDIDATE :
ESPECIALLY if those peeps have shared long and smouldering " hey whoah guess what I think I wanna boink you " glances in the past .
We eat many meals with forks today because we're like , " wow , this is way easier than getting spaghetti sauce all over my hands , face , clothing , and / or naked chest ! "
That's great - BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS ? ?
Still , it's not that bad .
Didn't Hitchcock make a movie about that ?
Sorry to interrupt , but I must be on my way ! I'm having dinner with the Utahraptor !
Look . I GUESS I DO .
In my new story , Professor Time teams up with her colleague , Doctor Space . Together , they are . . .
UTAHRAPTOR . He'll want to party ! That guy parties like it's 1999 , a rock star , AND like Marty .
That I have BLOWN PEOPLE'S MINDS ? ?
i'm a tiny robot
So here's the answer , babies : sometimes they will , sometimes they won't . Don't worry : most of the time they will though . We live in a world where most art is commercial and people boinking after a long period of not boinking but really wanting to boink is GREAT for business . Peeps wanna see peeps boink !
Those could be used by doctors !
You'll need a mark for this punctuation !
SOME SHORT TIME LATER . . .
I'm going to write a great novel ! It will be about one man's struggle to make a life for himself in the modern world , and it will be wonderful . He will achieve all he desires , and be at the peak of his career !
I'll be The Raptor , and my ability will be to sneak up behind you , jump on your back , hook my claws into your flesh , and tear you apart !
Oh noo !
HILARIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES
Yeah , vampires can make more vampires either through bites OR through sex . They have an entire reproduction option that we don't have !
Self - doubt !
It's the start of another awesome day !
GREETINGS T - REX I LOVE CLASSIC GAMING AND I WOULD LIKE OT INQUIRE AS TO YOUR OPINION OF CLASSIC GAMING
You seem to be big on going out by saving people !
Holy cow , T - Rex ! I didn't mind you singing your song the first time I heard it , but it's been four days ! Four days ! TIME FOR A NEW SONG !
Well T - Rex , here is one of my problems ! A friend of mine is pregnant , and she's really happy about it , but we're all not really sure that she's ready or that it's with the right person . It's not like it's any of our business , actually , but it's not like we can talk to her about it !
. . . is a sentence fragment ; I found another bug
I never do !
But I got opinions !
T - Rex ! Thank God I found you ! Is there anything we can do ?
I don't know why !
I guess !
Awkward moments are awkward because nobody knows what to do or say . But if you swoop in for a kiss , it's no longer an awkward moment ! You've avoided it entirely by transitioning it into a moment of " OH GREAT WHAT THE HACK NOW I HAVE TO SLAP THIS PERSON FOR THEIR UNWANTED ADVANCES " or even a moment of " OH GREAT WHAT THE HECK NOW THEY LOVE ME TOO "
I have the best idea ever for a series of books ! Oh MAN . I'll be rich and famous .
FIVE DAYS LATER :
Stop talking like that .
THE AIR SURROUNDING YOU SI THERE DUE TO THE COMPLEX AND RANDOM MOTION OF GAS MOLECULES . IT'S POSSIBLE THAT EACH AND EVERY MOLECULE COULD HAPPEN TO BOUNCE AWAY FROM YOU AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT , LEAVING YOU ASPHYXIATING TO DEATH IN A COMPLETE VACUUM .
As a T - Rex , I appreciate being able to gorge myself for one low price .
Babies cost like $ 100 , 000 to raise , dude .
Instead of saying " Sally and I are now dating exclusively " you can say " Sally and I are now seeing other people ONLY WITH REGRET . " On second thought , maybe you should keep the " Sally and I are now dating exclusively " because if I don't want to acknowledge your commitment , I can play dumb and say , " Sally and you are now dating exclusively . . . axe murderers ? Mad scientists ? Um , DOGS ? "
It probably sounded like a good idea at the time ?
You sick . . . of what ?
The cycle continues regardless !
Since I do not have a joke readily available , I will just have to resort to entertainment through violence .
Yes , all I have to do is be reincarnated . Indefinitely !
Everything he said was in all - caps Impact font .
Feel Ecstasy . Feel alive . ?
Before we even GET to that level , we should talk about boundaries : what's on and off the table ?
They're all genres wherein your body tells you when you're doing it right !
I have come up with the worst idea aver , and it's so simple . All you have to do is combine online gambling with online role playing games !
Honestly , I don't see any flaws !
People who say " Always be true to yourself " fail to consider that there are completely unrepentant murderers .
You say you've got several , all the way up to a PhD ? Neat ! Only , how come you haven't published more papers ? You have ? How come you don't have honourary degrees ? You do ! But how come yours isn't a household name ? If you're so great , WHY IS ANYTHING STILL LEFT UNEXPLAINED ? ?
I DIDN'T .
A chicken crosses the road and everyone demands you explain why this happened ! !
Just that ! They packed up everything they could and moved somewhere else , and it's not somewhere nearby ! They clearly thought things would be more utopic if they moved further away from ME . Argh ! I hate those guys so much right now !
All beliefs and ethics are " relative " !
Your car alarm is ridiculous . Years of trigger - happy alarms have trained the public to ignore them , and nobody would care if your tastelessly noisy car got stolen anyway . If someone had driven off in it last night as the alarm was blaring , I would have applauded him ! THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY SENSE OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY .
Precisely .
FIFTY YEARS LATER :
So what do you want raps about ?
Today's not Friday ! They're closed and they turned off their internet .
PALS .
UPSIDES TO GENDERED NOUNS
Maybe you'll like this one better ! Vin Diesel is pushing his car when he stopped outside a hotel and immediately went bankrupt . What the hell ? ?
Maybe it's because MY WIFE LEFT !
I CRACK MYSELF UP SOMETIMES
I've got a cold !
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT ALLERGIES T - REX
Screw everyone else !
Okay then !
I wonder what all my old friends are up to now . . . I haven't seen most of them since grade five !
You're looking for examples of historical meddling BY time travellers !
Or MAYBE I should be happy that I basically wrote two books in as many days , and got them published in an afternoon , and that's kinda impressive even if they aren't selling that well so far ? ?
Huh ? Oh , no - I was just saying " Yes ! " because I was remembering how I felt this morning when I found my keys !
Whoah ! ! It's EVEN BETTER when you hear the amazing part ! !
A HISTORY OF HYSTERIA
Aging ?
The object of Monopoly is to fully explore the sensations of boredom , sorrow and rage . In this sense , EVERYONE'S a winner , as it will become clear in the first 30 minutes that you've lost , yet the game will grind on for hours after that . It is during this time that you will explore these emotions . It is during this time that you will wonder what you did to deserve this .
Gah ! !
OH NO
What finally killed him ?
Incredible , no ? And when we say " pecs " , we're actually saying the short form of " pectoral muscles " !
HI NEIGHBOUR ! CAN WE BORROW A CUP OF FLOUR ?
So annoying ! Plus , I saw this other ad on the same day that said " everyone approved O . A . C . "
eat less chickens !
I'm sensing a formula in your books .
I would like more dreams in UHF please
I have constructed nothing less than FRIEND SIMULATORS in my very mind !
But what if they want you to do conflicting things ?
THE MINOTAUR
A book for CHILDREN !
That's a racially charged insult !
Man , screw those guys ! If these raccoons and cephalopods want to unsettle me , they should know that " you really don't want to know " line was NEVER scary . It's not going to work ! They need more than a cliche phrase to scare me , Dromiceiomimus !
And you consider this information so irrelevant that you forgot it almost as soon as it was known .
Boy , what a delicious yoghurt ! I bet it was made with all sorts of sexduction .
You don't have kids , dude !
Yeah
Is it colin @ chumpstakingdumps . com ?
But that other lady - -
I can do both ! Observe :
WHAT IS THE WORST SENTENCE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMICS
# 3 : EMAIL
I'm not going to leave what happens to me after I die up to others . What if they put on a weaksauce funeral ?
I guess that's because most of us have finite lifespans , and waiting steals TINY NIBBLES from our metaphorical life cookie !
And OBVIOUSLY I always summarize my friends while walking over to their house !
SO ANYWAY THIS IS ME TELLING YOU TO AT LEAST PUT YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ON A USB STICK SOMEWHERE
But wouldn't you RATHER I owe you one hundred and thirty dollars ?
The only cure for Kissing Fever is . . . a little tongue ?
ALL T - REX HAS EVER LEARNT FROM FEELINGS :
YES . And I am going to make it HAPPEN .
No , man ! That's a sucky way to go down in history . But as the first MURDEREE in space , going out as a floating corpse in Zero G : that's something ! And it's totally easy . All I need to do is convince some spaceman , when the time comes , to murder me !
Utahraptor , I am the worst at love poems .
You're not fixing her relationship problems ! You're running away from her because you don't know how to fix her problem !
You didn't ! Whatever ; I heard you clearly .
It'll be fantastic , Dromiceiomimus ! I will motivate through a combination of folk wisdom and " uncommon sense " advice couched in clever stock market analogies !
SOON : WACKINESS ! !
HISTORY FOR YOU IS A BIG PARTY WHERE EVERYONE JUST HANGS OUT TOGETHER , ISN'T IT ?
For instance :
I mean - I mean my friend has seen the pictures .
Art , am I right ? ?
As you put your hand on the door to Relationship Towne , you decide to want to shoot some dudes instead .
OKAY OKAY YOU WIN THANKS I'M GOOD FOR EROTICA YOU CAN STOP NOW
If I've got to die , I'd rather it's from being too awesome than being too old , you know ? I want my obit to tell a story that doesn't end with " and then his body decined until it stopped working entirely , the end . "
But just in case it isn't , I've invented a new way for it to be used ! JUST LIKE THAT , BABY . Now " hugga bubba " is ALSO the new " um " , the new " ah " , and the new " er " . Instead of saying " Um , I have no idea " , we can say " Hugga bubba , I have no idea ! "
YES YOU ARE AND I BELIVE YOU'RE GOING FOR 100 % COMPLETION
I received an invitation via the post last night ! A very exclusive invitation . . .
Are there cash awards for poetry , do you know ?
Not Hardly ! Telegrams were better because they made you go to the door to get them , which meant folks knew you were popular AND getting an important message . Plus they charged by the word so people were concise ! Also I think you had to write " STOP " instead of a period so the messages were rad , stop .
Aw man ! Everyone who ever lived and didn't suck knows it now ?
I am on the lookout for science , personified !
What ? No ! !
Which means , of course , that I had better get started working on my costume !
I'M REALLY ARGUING THIS , yes .
All I can eat !
I'm not really sure how I did that ! !
No , they're awesome ! My machines SELF - REPLICATE , stopping only if they run out of food . What's creepy about that ?
Strength's part of overall fitness . Let's get fit , T - Rex ! You and me !
No problem ! Write your own book , and you can restore yourself from backup by reading it after !
What's that , radio ?
It is a problem
" Plan C ! "
Sure am ! While Superman may be fictional , the cake and good times will be SUPER real !
APPARENTLY , when one's startled , one can sometimes fall out of zeppelins ? ?
You know how in games sometimes you'll save right before your guy dies , so you'll keep restoring over and over , hoping that this time you'll be able to save your dude ?
Why are you leaving in mid conversation ; many cultures consider that RUDE ?
. . . Okay !
Much like . . . most things ?
Can you write my story for me real quick ? I'll pay you .
Okay ! Today's letter comes from Pete .
MEANWHILE , AT SCIENCE HEADQUARTERS !
And which ALSO sounds casual !
I mean , YEAH , but nothing I can see through to completion in a few hours .
ALTHOUGH ! It's not bad if you're six
T - REX PLEASE TRY TO STAY IN CHARACTER HERE , OKAY ?
ABRA - CAD -
T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR ARE GOING TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST :
She continues to ignore us .
I really don't know very much about panhandling , and a lot of people feel really strongly about it . I don't know ! I usually try to learn more about things by doing them , but if I panhandled I'd be a total poseur .
RIGHT ON I AM GOING TO BE LATE FOR WORK
" SMOKIN' BOD "
The worst ?
You too are in my way , little woman !
Note : replacements may not be available in all areas .
No no , the ghost haunts her . Like a house ? And then she dies and the ghost dies too so it's like , Russian nesting doll ghosts . This happens several times over the course of the narrative , so by the end , there's so many ghosts - within - ghosts that the only possible response is ULTIMATE TERROR .
Well , you're raised pretty much every socio - reproductive issue in the book , and also RUINED THE LIFE OF AN IMAGINARY CHILD .
That's right ! I NEVER
Holy crap ! ! This remix . . . JUST GOT REAL
I know a handful of justifications for doing this !
LISTEN T - REX MOST FOLKS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A CHUMMY RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD WITH BETTER QUESTIONS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW
So do you want to come over for a meat party , Dromiceiomimus ? I had my freezer stuffed with meat and it's all thawing now . The chicken's got to be cooked and I figure there's more than enough to go around ! I've also got steaks AND pork chops and tons more .
{ { thought bubble } } I have no memory of this , but I DO only break out the " X - D " emoticons in the course of a sincere apology { { / thought bubble } }
It is indeed , T - Rex . A fine day for going to the beach - is that where you're headed ?
THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO TOAST :
Plus , chips can be made to taste like OTHER foods ! !
How is that a bad thing ? It's the most widely - cultivated plant -
AND WE'RE STOPPING AT EVERY STATION .
YEAH IF DARK ENERGY HAS ENOUGH REPULSIVE POWER TO CONTINUOUSLY INCREASE THE EXPANSION RATE OF THE UNIVERSE EVENTUALLY GALAXIES WILL BE TORN APART THEN PLANETS AND THEN ATOMS THEMSELVES
But this is not the only way .
ESPECIALLY depressed people .
You've got a lot of theories about the past , eh ?
Did you hear that friggin' updates are available to be installed , T - Rex ?
And this makes you not old .
The new MacBooks have cases that are made out of ALUMINUM .
NOPE : EXPOSURE . THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AS THE TEMPERATURE DROPS .
Well , frig . You know what I'm going to do ? I'm going to get some NEW friends , and I'm going to gossip all about you with them .
But Daffy's his name ! Shouldn't we think of him when we hear it ?
I learnt a new phrase today !
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
WHY NOT ? Who indeed made an art that is the best ? ?
Aquaman ?
I'm literally being killed to death by this giant bird ! !
YEP THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT MAGIC
FAILURE TOWNE IS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT NATION HUH
Does the world look normal to you ?
Oooh ! Hey , I've got some questions !
WITH T - REX
5 little baby T - Rexes , each with their own pair of cute little arms !
Utahraptor , I can live in a world of immutable scientific laws , or I can live in a world where I need to revenge myself on my kitchen floor because it smashed up a glass I dropped .
What if instead of saying something's " rad " , we say it has . . .
When some slugs an snails get horny , they try to spear each other with a spear grown inside their own bodies before actually having sex !
" We Need Leaders Who Actually Understand Technology . " Ahem . Amelia and Antonio Tony stood in the bedroom . They were going to have sex ! This is how things looked like they were going to me , the omniscient third - person narrator : sexy times ahoy .
THEY'RE PRETTY BIG
I have a new science question , Professor ! !
I don't like missing out on awesome things , but I'm worried that awesome things are happening ALL THE TIME AROUND ME AHHHHHH
We are going to TALK TO EACH OTHER UNTIL EVERYONE IS BORED as soon as the weather gets super cold , T - Rex ! !
Okay , here's the news : I am not your friend Ren ? but I am just as good . My name is T - Rex and I am a good role model . I brush my teeth regularly and when I forget to I tell myself to try HARDER . Basically , what I am saying here is " I am a stranger on the internet who has taken a particular interest in your child "
spork !
Suddenly , he had another deduction , which happened a lot because he was smart . " Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot ! " he realized , " therefore I will dress up like a bat and punch them when I want more information on cases . Hah ! Elementary ! ! " . He set to quickly creating his " Bat - Man " suit . It was awesome .
I could , but this is something you should really learn to do for yourself , T - Rex !
EVERYTHING everything ?
Dromiceiomimus , you have stumbled upon my shameful secret ! I - I don't have a family doctor !
Yesssss
Lampshade hanging is when you've got something hella dumb in your story , but then Shakespeare shows up and says " Forsooth , guys , that's dumb " and then the audience accepts it !
TIP : Searching for " how do I die " may return results that appear to rapidly change under your gaze . Remember : knowledge of the future changes the future , destroying itself .
Okay ! Today is the day I go down in the record books for being the first guy who - who , um . . .
Oh ! You're not supposed to use them if they're not true . I guess they're more " good reasons " than " good excuses " , bro !
Everything ?
What are you sad about ? Whisper it to me ; I promise I won't tell .
" This reminds me of some of my previous adventures , " Batman thought to himself , while typing out " k you need 2 go 2 jail now " on the keyboard . The giant keys rained punishing blows on the Joker's struggling form ! !
Attracting women is easy !
I can get both of those at the corner store , AND they're open 24 hours a day for my convenience !
Man , what was I talking about ? It was a terrible idea to marry someone just because of her cool slang !
That sounds close to flexitarians , who only eat meat when being vegetarian would be rude or inconvenient !
5555 YEARS AGO :
Hott ! !
Oh my god ! Exactly ! !
Yeah , I get that ! So , what : the mental strength , self - confidence and I guess time - management skills intrinsic to having twenty girlfriends ?
Any sufficiently - advance technology is indistinguishable from magic , T - Rex ! Arthur C . Clarke said it .
Did you know that he was named a " messenger of peace " by the United Nations , Utahraptor ?
Further , Maldives considered , a protein skimmer must be included , used to remove food and waste particles from the tank . Plus live rocks , which , despite their name , aren't actually alive ! Rather , they're dead coral covered in microscopic marine organisms , which helps clean , filter , and nitrify the water .
" I HAVE THE ANTIDOTE "
I know , and SOMEWHERE , it all went wrong !
My friend , I will handle that situation by simply " ignoring my principles " and " reversing my position " .
Pfft . A little thing called FLAVOUR ENGINEERING solves that one . Just take whatever foods you need to eat to NOT DIE and add them to an iced cream ! I propose savoury meat - flavoured ice creams , bitter kale - flavoured ice creams , and , dare I say : sprinkles that are secretly . . . VITAMINS ? ?
It occurs to me : every time I do something private , I'm REALLY just betting that technology to look into the arbitrary past won't ever be developed . Because if it is ever invented , game over , man , game over ! People will be able to look at any moment in history !
Irony . Haven't you heard ? It's cool to do things you no longer enjoy .
So logically , ALL I HAVE TO DO is find a really rich guy and tell him a joke only HE'D find funny , and I'm set for life !
We join our story as T - Rex is relaying dumb stories he's heard and believes to be true .
I know it's terrible , and I know many people are like this . But I can't deny it any longer ! I am that guy !
" Security issues " ! What's better security than living in a house surrounded by CORPSES ? " Oh hey , let's go steal the TV from the corpse house " ? NOBODY HAS EVER SAID THAT , UTAHRAPTOR ! !
I was ! But then I started trying to own it , you know ?
Saturday : It's Right Now !
The ghost realized that this book was way beneath his reading level .
Valentine's Day ? !
The first announcement is that I am awesome !
What if our universe exists for but a single split second , but it seems like billions of years for us , caught inside it ?
The Nutrinomicon divides foods into four different 'groups . ' These 'groups' have prescribed allowances per day .
Or you , for that matter !
Sorry suckers , but y'all are duds ! "
Quebec style !
Totally did ! You said " And you're invited , Utahraptor ! "
Well , that was pretty much the best adventure ever ! Do you recall when we got trapped in that mine that was filling up with water very quickly ?
What ? There's nothing unmanly about that !
But not for long !
How do you mean ?
Well , instead of complaining about stories you don't like , why not write some that you do ?
Um , yeah , I kinda think CHRISTMAS BEING CANCELLED FOREVER might get people's attention ? ?
For me , I mean
You're using " plasticized " a bit unusually there , T - Rex . Is that part of your new slang ?
YO RIGHT HERE
Precisely . Doctor ?
T - Rex , you have cooties ?
Shh ! We're not supposed to notice !
Perhaps it's because instead of arguing a point , you're just asking us if you're right ?
Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes have had the times of their respective lives ! They're each the one thing the other can't get enough of - this could be love , Dromiceiomimus !
Maybe the alarm came with the car ?
Guys ! I am not alone in this !
Automobiles responsibility ! Children ! Housing !
Exactly ! " Well , actually - I totally do not , 100 % . " Thank you !
T - REX WHAT'S GOING ON
More about what I'm looking for : i want to die in a bog .
Giraffes have the lowest sleep needs of any land mammal !
THE TESLA COILS ARE A WISE DEFENSIVE STRATEGY
FACTS ABOUT HORSES
What if everything I did was expressly designed to make a certain someone love me ?
45 MINUTES LATER : REGRETS
IF THE POLICE ARREST A MIME , DO THEY SAY HE HAS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT ?
I GOT IT , THANKS
They invented it !
You can't talk to Billy Idol that way !
Behold , my art ! I wrote " art " on a blank canvas and glued some screenshots of my favourite emoji around it ! ! My pal Utahraptor likes it ! !
Foreshadowing is when you hint at what's about to happen next in a story ! It happens whenever a character announces " BOY I SURE HOPE THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIONS ON THE NEXT PAGE ! ! " just before he gets blown up !
And it's whipping around the sun , and the sun is rotating in the arm of a galaxy that's also whipping around the Universe . You go back in time without travelling through space , you're likely to find yourself alone in the vacuum , millions of kilometers behind the Earth you left a ( relative ) instant ago !
NOW TO BE BETTER AT STREET HARASSMENT
55 , 555 YEARS AGO :
You know what's great ?
Nope ! My parties only ever go UP notches ! They go all the way to the top ! Extreme !
That is why I will ask the Utahraptor to do them for me !
They're not like us !
Therefore , I am going into politics !
Wow , all I have to do is follow your advice , and all my problems are solved !
Hmmm . . . no , but that sounds like a great topic for my thesis ! Thanks for the idea .
It's SO EASY , in fact , that I'll totally do it later ! !
But there's no place on Earth that even comes CLOSE to having such high radiation levels !
ASSUMING THEY STOP READING AT PANEL 5 ANYWAY
Sucks to be you !
Even better - - imagine if , just as you were reading this , the power cut out ?
Manga , yes ! Incredible that you guessed that , by the way . Anyway MANGA is from Japan and in Japanese you read right - to - left so that's what you do in manga too !
Thanks , Dromiceiomimus . But man , who stands someone up on St . Patrick's day ? BESIDES MY DATE , THAT IS ! !
They do call them that !
Weirrrrd
When you become a vampire you become undead . Even though your body has died and your heart no longer pumps and lungs no longer breathe , you live still . Your brain is fine . Your intelligence is unaffected . You have not suffered a death og self .
I know ! Casey is good at squeezing bums ; that's pretty much canon
No , so you'd know that a " patron of the arts " doesn't just mean you go to galleries . It means you give a significant amount of money to support art and artists ! It's where you put your disposable income .
Well ! That was an unusual interaction !
A sea shanty ? Like , a pirate song ?
IT IS GOING TO BE A SURPRISE
There you are ! Knock , knock .
I'M INTO THEM
Sure can !
GREECE , 405 BC
Classy ! Glad you could make it !
Um , why do you think you're a genius , T - Rex ?
Facebook was invented by Ma -
that their clothing and automobiles were old - fashioned , that their landscape lacked skyscrapers and other contemporary buildings , that their world was black
. . . Teach me your secrets ?
Sure can , dude !
But later Timmy dumped Sally , Sally was really sad !
This seems a little derivative , T - Rex !
What about " Quai - Zhi " ?
REGRET
History is pretty good if you want to know what MIGHT have happened in the time before breakfast this morning ! But most histories fail to account for one very important thing : TWINS .
That's a horrific idea !
We all might be dead SOMEDAY !
Such a nice day ! YES , MAYBE A LITTLE BRISK BUT THAT'S OKAY !
Doctor Professor Stephen Cook first pondered whether God likes poutine in 1971 ; his seminal paper on the subject has made him one of the forefathers of computational complexity theory / God poutine .
. . . And then clarified down to a size medium
But I love okay times !
DONE
Maybe you'd all like to come and have some dinner first ?
HISTORY : SUPER SEXIST
This is the line for the bathroom !
I may well be the perfect mate ! Don't you think ?
So Dromiceiomimus was making out with some random guy and jennifing his face . That's fine .
This one I'm actually in favour of !
Here are some simple ways to improve your life !
Free will ?
Space alien flavoured chips ! !
Eh , Dromiceiomimus ? Pretty awesome ! By saying the words of these phrases in UNPOPULAR order , I subvert people's expectations AND the bolts and nuts of language itself !
True .
Has this Jane America you speak of done otherwise before ?
This is what I'm talking about ! ! This is going to be the best date ever IN TIME .
Not really ! Since there is always SOME doubt as to whether someone is just being polite , one can always take something as a compliment !
Huh ! I actually hadn't considered ironic valentines , which I do like . Hmm . . .
* siiigh *
Okay ! Let me think . . .
A prequel ?
Later , at an artist bar :
You don't look very sad to me !
There's a webcomic I enjoy , but one thing bothers me !
Man , here I thought it stood for " Fellow Against Galactophagists " !
Festering ryoma , for instance !
ADVANCED WRITING TIPS
It's my new favorite song !
Today is a good day I think for revenge !
Today is a good day I think for going to all - you - can - eat restaurants !
You might rediscover some old " likes " - and maybe even some new " favs " !
I have some bad news : zombies are in danger of becoming old hat ! It's TRUE . But I have a solution to make them interesting again : all you need is stories where not just people but ANIMALS become undead !
YOU KNOW JUST CHECKING IN WITH MY MAIN MAN
Hah hah , awesome !
What are you doing ?
No , YOU'RE a bastard !
What about " By T - Rex , t he insatiable devourer of worlds . . of IMAGINATION ! " ?
whoa whoa whoa ! T - Rex ! Nobody wants to hear about your lovemaking 'technique' !
Maaaaaan
I guess , but I never remember them at the morning !
I guess that really was . . . The Origin of Species .
I want to write something that'll make people see the world through fresh eyes ! Something they'll want to pass on to their children !
HOW TO ASK SOMEONE OUT ON A DATE
Dude has ZERO PROBLEMS anymore . Car stuck in a ditch ? Hey let me call my friend , A LITERAL SUPER MAN . Being mugged ? Wow if only there was some kind of GOD - LIKE SPACE ALIEN I could call to help out !
SPEECH DAY
Man , if I don't find a washroom soon others will be disappointed in me
Sexduction .
I am this guy , in case that wasn't clear !
What if I want to learn about the past and NOT be reminded of my own inevitable upcoming demise ? ?
It's okay , T - Rex . You misunderstood a joke , and I'm sorry I got so mad .
[ ] YES
Easy ! BE AWESOME .
But some are totally rad ! You know when the edge of a house is lined with lights , so from a distance it looks like a solid wireframe model ?
RARELY IF EVER .
I think she's right , T - Rex .
DINOSAUR TIP 1 : TRICERATOPS LIKES WEEDS , DISLIKES GOOSEBERRIES
Oh , the Saltine Challenge ! It's actually really hard , T - Rex . Your mouth is going to dry out and you'll find it impossible to swallow .
Ladies ! You can call me the Cloacademic ! Care to join my . . . cloacademy ?
That's a bit obvious for a sequel , don't you think ?
Niiiiice .
I agree ! I would say that if the relationship is failing despite these tips , then you and your man may have insurmountable , fundamental differences , even if you love each other more than you can say . Nothing is meant to last forever ladies !
Okay ! !
HEY T - REX REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ARRESTED
All dead ! Today's readers yawn in the face of foreshadowing ! They wince when seeing ANY events that occur after the climax ! They throw up a little when a part is used to represent the whole ! You can tell when that's happened because you'll go to the library and hear " Synedoche ? ! bleggh "
The one that symbolizes our family : each precious family member connected to the other ? The necklace which , if one pearl is removed , is shattered forever ? Sure , I don't see why not !
Turn to page 32 to be spooked by the spooky ghost ! Turn to page 14 if you'd rather see the same ghost and be TERRIFIED !
You know sign language ?
" Oh no , is my tall character's head impacting against a low - hanging beam ? Has my short character wandered into an open cupboard and is now stumbling , forever lost amongst the pots and pans ? ? " ? YOU , AGAIN
but don't worry , i'm not going to turn you guys into zombies too ! i wouldn't be a very good friend if i did that , and the book i got at the centre says that being a good friend is awful important !
Six ! Folks who say that's ALSO a good point and furthermore , that there's certainly nothing wrong with personal tastes !
But what I don't like is when they get out of bed and look in a mirror and only THEN do they realize something's wrong . It's ridiculous !
aw , who am i kidding ?
For instance , if you're doing a story on how the sun is hot ( assuming it's a slow news day ) , you don't spend half the story presenting a guy who thinks the sun is cold ! You ignore the crazy minority .
Where have I heard that before ?
That's it ! I understand where you're coming from SO DANG HARD that I think we should break up too ! !
Well , you could similarly ask why we don't all wear fancy clothes all the time .
Okay , I may have been a little hard on plants . I concede that , yes , there ARE some plants that actually do some cool things .
You can die there for FREE .
So ! In summary and in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen of the jury :
You brought this problem on yourself .
* gaaaaaaaaaaaaasp *
Did you know you can find instructions for making a bomb on the interweb ?
I only wish I'd frozen lobsters !
Snow it's not !
Thank you so much for the little gloves , Dromiceiomimus !
You think you have the monopoly on truth !
I'm on my way there now !
Aw MAN ! Dromiceiomimus wins the regret competition AGAIN ! !
The play sounds like a lecture ! If he'd called his play " Check out Time . . . at Hotel Erotical ! " or " Good Grieffe , More Robot Suits " then MAYBE people would have kept the play around .
uh
T - REX WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON - - NEWS
oh man
You HAVE ? ?
But it's an addiction !
T - Rex , I read your comic ! The one you slipped under my door with the note " FEED BACK PLZ ; ) " ?
You're becoming a generic stand - up comedian !
You'll read things like , " Lost my ring , may the thief not urinate nor defecate nor speak nor sleep , and may the gods consume their blood , eyes , and every limb , and also torture and kill their horses " and not even bat an eye .
UTAHRAPTOR , I am exploring my own sexual interests here , so um thanks for understanding ? ? Anyway now she's a polypous creature in a crown of weeping faces , gnashing teeth surrounding a single titanic eye at her core , all dressed in a barely - there red bikini .
Most assuredly !
Some don't find themselves sexually attracted to anyone , while others do , but find all they want in friendship and have no desire to add kissing to the mix .
So not ONLY can we solve these land dispute issues by moving around claims , there's a big chunk that nobody has bothered to claim ownership on , UNTIL NOW . I hereby ?
We'll still know it's you who put the presents there , T - Rex !
You are aware of the difficulty entailed in simply managing one's life today !
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT WE COULD ALL TELL YOU WERE THINKING IT .
GOD !
" Well , sure . . . "
T - Rex loves zombies !
Man , I don't need that acting job anyway ! I can get by on my good looks and charm ANYWAY , and " essay writing tips " are easy .
NO DICE
We're going to bike down to the ice cream store and we're going to get ice cream and nobody's ice cream is going to fall into the dirt , I PROMISE . The near future is gonna be great , Utahraptor ! Tomorrow's nothing but ice cream on wheels .
Then she built a maze and put him inside it , yeah ?
Have you written 10 pages of a 15 - page essay and you're KINDA DONE WRITING FOR NOW ? Don't worry . Lucky for you you took a break and came to me and now you're gonna learn yourself something called
How did you get this far thinking that
That's correct , Dromiceiomimus ! Or should I say , " 100 % , Dromiceiomimus ! " ?
Why'd you stop ? I bet this game would be even more fun as an adult , since way more things have changed since you were a kid . In fact , I might play it myself !
LISTEN I DON'T THINK THIS DATE IS GOING VERY WELL
Aww , you wrecked it !
That's how negotiators know you're serious . After you flip it , say " Okay , you wanna try that sentence again ? Maybe try harder this time ? "
He's my twin from another skin !
Your score is zero points . Your name is carved on your gravestone ; beneath it your epitaph reads " Aw geez , I think someone messed up with his name . Good grief . "
By focusing only on the callings that have maximum impressiveness per second , I can build a Totally Sweet R ? sum ? in the MATHEMATICALLY MINIMUM amount of time .
Holy cow . . . what a disaster !
HOLY MOLEY
Wow . You know , you never cease to surprise me , my friend . I thought I was breaking new ground by having an interest in kites , but here it turns out you have ample experience !
Later , Robyn found a tape where if you watched it then you'd die within the next seven days , and she used it to kill the mold in her basement .
And then I realized : any animal that I eat either eats plants or eats another animal ! Thus does cruel mistress Induction decree that this entire chain is based on plants , and so even when I'm eating meatburgers I'm eating SUN , the only way I know : INDIRECTLY .
I know , IT SOUNDS CRAZY , but stay with me !
I get the appeal of this fantasy , T - Rex , but it kinda died last decade , didn't it ?
IS A LIE
That's not an explanation ! That's not even close to an explanation !
My third wish is for you to wish for me to wish for you to wish for ME to have more restriction - free wishes !
What if I offended someone sexy ?
So what's in the news three years ago ?
( We believe materials are deoxygenated and become oxygenated when burning ! )
Well , that's right , but if you ever find yourself in this situation , you can just join a club or a team and meet new people that way !
* gasp * So sexist ! !
Featuring : me !
I'm still totally gonna be on the lookout for bad hookups ! !
It's a hunk whose ass is jive ! You're God . You must know some ! !
Wait - that's actually correct , isn't it ? The moon totally IS an old boys' club !
T - REX TELL ME A BIBLE STORY
Look at you , Mr . & # 8220 ; I can & # 8217 ; t suspend my disbelief for a SPACE TUGBOAT named & # 8216 ; Tuggy & # 8217 ; & # 8221 ; ! He moves by pushing against the aether , okay ?
When I was younger , I went to the dentist a lot . MAYBE I DIDN'T BRUSH MY TEETH THAT WELL , OKAY ? OR THAT OFTEN , OR AT ALL .
I'm just saying : five - weekend months aren't that rare . And if we're counting Friday as weekend , why not Monday too ?
She began a regime of careful observations ! After a few weeks she had a few data points . ONE : the goose was not eating any gold . so it must be produced internally . TWO : Gold produced / ( food consumed + body mass lost ) = 5 % = a transmutation efficiency equation . And THREE : other geese feeding in the same area would not produce golden eggs . So she concluded , quite rightly , that the phenomenon was related to the goose itself !
today's technique : ANACHRONISM
I'm gonna say , " yes " ?
" I worry that the standards are too low here , Nd I'm not challenged to be the best person I can . I don't want to feel like I'm the smartest person in the roo . I wanna feel like I'm the dumbest " .
So , I guess we're not that into the " worst sentence ever " thing ?
Man this is old news , Professor Curmudgeonly ! You ever seen something escalate ?
I need to be home by 7
vice - mayor
Have you tried faking it ?
What ? No !
Wait wait wait ! !
Maybe it gets boring when people are super nice to you all the time !
Everyone you've ever loved is a walking talking combination poop factory / poop storage facility , and when you hug them , you're pressing your poop - filled belly up against their poop - filled belly and applying pressure .
You're seriously jealous of mammals , T - Rex ?
I'm sorry ?
There's nothing wrong with that !
Oh , I see how it is ! You don't really think I'm an elite professional , do you ?
T - REX KNOWING EVERYTHING IS NOT ACTUALLY THAT GREAT
And THEN she made Medusa's face so crazy that anyone who saw it would turn to stone !
Well - I have an idea .
Well , it looks like we've got a Christmas Mystery on our hands !
Or was , anyway !
Hey ! Hey you , across the street !
Well , what's an example where the middle ground is not correct ?
Oh my goodness you've just given me a great idea for my new autobiography ! !
I DON'T KNOW WHERE T - REX IS GOING WITH THIS . IT IS JUST ONE CLICH ? AFTER ANOTHER . IF I COULD TALK TO T - REX I WOULD SAY , HELLO T - REX , WHAT IS THE DEAL .
But our friend Zach is a ghost , and he's not blind OR deaf !
Oh , for sure , but all my accents sound like bad Irish fakes !
Oh , just about octopods !
. . . Those are the only two ways to exit a job , T - Rex . Even if the company goes under , they're still letting you go .
But perhaps I intend to write down these words later , and then create a card out of them , and then hand this card out to people . Perhaps that !
THAT'S UH
How embarrassing !
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh !
I'm afraid so ! You'll either end up saying nothing at all , or run the risk of saying something that could be false when viewed from another perspective ! Eventually you'll end up saying an untruth to SOMEONE .
I'm SINCERELY SURPRISED by how poorly my erotic imagination prepared me for solving such serious world issues .
When you lower your facial skin flaps , your eyes stare unblinkingly at the inside of your own fleshy head . Hair sprouts from each flap's edge .
But I've heard rumours that consuming words AND pictures at the same time is far too challenging for all but the greatest professional readers at the peak of their careers !
Who told you that ? !
Um , yes please ! !
But allow me to distract you with some facts about Dromiceiomimus : she really likes all kinds of boats . AND , and , she's afraid of heights sometimes !
BUSINESS IDEA : god trading cards !
ARGH ! I am getting angry just thinking about it !
It's my favourite season :
And this is appealing , T - Rex ?
No doubt !
Utahraptor , please ! For every Batman argument that comes out of my mouth there's like eighty of them that go on in my head .
This frankly two out of a possible five stars conversation
Here's the secret : YOU HAVE A BODY .
DENIED !
You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound ! Nice .
Um , according to some religions , GOD CAN DO ANYTHING ? ?
It's only awkward if you comment on it !
The coolest of all these words , though , are clearly those on the threshold of acceptability .
But these " zombies " act human ?
So then I just gave her a new bill . It was a little embarrassing , but my REAL problem is what to do with this fiver , now that I know it's a fake !
He took over 40 thousand photographs - not bad for one guy ! And in many cases , his records are the only recorded history we've got . But what's amazing about Curtis is that he specifically set out to record the doomed people his culture imagined Indians to be : the noble savage , the Indian that was alien , stoic , exotic and dying .

And even though sometimes I talk so much that I don't let her get a word in edgewise , I'm still happy to give her the book I got , called " I'll Talk Less And Listen More : A Book To Give A Friend Who Is Pretty Okay , More Than Pretty Okay , Even ! "

Leprosy doesn't make your limbs fall off ! ! You lose SENSATION in your body , so you can do things like accidentally crush your fingers and not notice . Hey , how's the centuries - old prejudice over there ? Pretty uninformed ? Pretty BIASED ?

" He pronounces it like 'Freeze' , OBVIOUSLY " , he added !
Hey guys , I brought a nice salad - Quebec style !

T - REX CONTINUES HIS MISSION TO REMOVE HUMANS FROM MOVIES :
Tip 3 : In some situtations , like truck stops , manliness is measured by virility , so you may wish to boast of sexual conquests . But in other situations ( job interviews ) , it's measured by problem solving skills and your ability to work in groups !
For instance , I'd like to see a machine intelligence feel the relief of a cool breeze on a hot summer's night . They can't , because they're machines !
" Furthermore , we employ over twelve forms of 'the' and she only uses one ! "

You're actually - you're bettering yourself for the sake of a pun . It's impressive . It's annoying AND impressive . It's like you spent years getting a medical degree just so you could mess with Photoshop and claim a picture has been " doctored " .
I'm wearing underpants on my head AND passing my driver's test !
Oh God . Listen , I want something more like " Number of Enemies That Said 'I Wish I Wasn't T - Rex's Enemy Anymore' , Frig " . In fact , that's perfect .
Seriously ? I guess my trip through time wasn't all bad then . I probably shouldn't have slept with my grandmother , though .
And double exclamation marks don't count , bitches ! !
T - REX ASK HIM WHERE THE DUDE WHO CAN HAVE THREE PANELS OF FANTASY IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE SENTENCE RATES
We will not be " rolling in dough " , Utahraptor . We will be SNOWBOARDING down MOUNTAINS of dough . Dough will splash up and get in our eyes . We will have to go to the doctor , and we will say , " You can keep what you pull out of my eyes , Doc . These days I'm snowboarding down mountains of the stuff . "
I demand further examples !
What gets me is the whole conflict in them : the position of " I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you " , with the caveat of " Oh , baby , but just in case " . I understand on a PRACTICAL level about how prenups are - practical , but on the level of love , I don't see how you're allowd to hedge your bets when it comes to marriage ! I thought marriage was the ultimate expression of love .
I respectfully disagree !
Uh - well , what I want to say is that I'm sorry I said I had sex with your Mom last night . I actually didn't have sex with anyone last night .
I know , Dromiceiomimus I know ! But I'm sick of that being used as an excuse . I am demanding BIG ANSWERS . There must be some way to arrive at a solution !
Everyone knows what second base is , T - Rex ! First base is significant glances across a crowded room , second is quietly holding hands , third base is eating the same strand of spaghetti and a home run is totally smooching !
Last night I built myself a machine . . .
Tada ! The aging machine is completed !
Or , like , stories ?
You're an extremely disruptive , world - changing event that ends our dominance of the planet ?
WHOSE NAME
And if so , where do I meet them , because it sounds like they might be fun to pal around with ?
Utahraptor , I managed to pull it out with the best shirt design EVER . It appeals to everyone who has ever worn clothes .
But where does love fit into this system of Objectivism , T - Rex ?
T - Rex , you left the burner on at your house last night and it burnt down .
It's scary ! Some people who suffer brain damage can have their entire personality rewritten . Heck , add some chemcials and you can alter how and what a person thinks !
Because without a spin there's no centrifugal force !
" Punch it " means go fast !
T - REX LOVES OUT - OF - GENRE COVER SONGS
But music could do it too ! For instance , suppose the tubas played the wrong note and then everyone has to go back and start over .
So - what ? You enjoy the irony of the word , T - Rex ?
Not much !
Sure ! But this will probably need some planning . We'll need to plan out what we want to do each day , and where , so we can maximize our adventure . We'll need some provisions , too .
Congratulations self ! You are our leading candidate !
It's not as though childbirth is a pleasant experience on the surface !
Oh , okay ! I guess I do , a little .

I'm not sure how serious you are , T - Rex , but it's a great idea ! Two towns over I'M known as " Ornithomimus J . Edmontonicus " .
I believe the fault of this lies in the inherent design flaws of the credit card system . If I give a credit card to someone , that should authorize one purchase , for a specific amount , at that specific time ! Instead , knowing someone's credit card information allows you to make charges to it for any amount , at any time , all over the world !
I can't hear you !
Yep ! And a bunch of related programs .
They're just teasing you , T - Rex ! They just get a rise out of you so they keep at it .
Remember : nobody's allowed to take candy from strangers for another full year !

T - REX CAN YOU RATE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIC PEN - AND - PAPER RPGS
TYPES OF HATS
Do I ever !
I have recently acquired some snake oil , and it has inspired me to compile a list of professions that have been ruined by lexicalized phrases !
For example , books could have pages like " It is a universal truth that a single man with a large amount of fortune is in need of a life . Hah hah , what did I write ? . . . 'Life ? ' I meant 'wife' . Okay : new sheet of paper everyone , I promise we're gonna get this . Ready ? We're ready ? Okay . It is a universal truth that a single man with a large amount of fortune is in need of a wifppppfft - I'm sorry ! I got the giggles . Okay . Okay . Okay . Let's do this . "

I HAD , but they were always dreams in which everyone else could fly and I couldn't . You know the one where everyone realizes they can fly by jumping and flapping their arms , but when you try it , you just hop a tiny bit higher than normal ? And it's KINDA cool but everyone else is flying so it's not THAT cool ?
I always thought it was something special !
Perhaps you are just listening to it wrong ! It's funny because skeletons have no internal organs . Hah hah hah ! How is he animate ? Why is he thirsty ? It sure raises some funny questions !

I am not fully convinced you've earned SO MANY TINY BRIBES
NO WAY .
I used to volunteer those very sentences at parties !
Also , sometimes they have punchlines at the end !
Ahh , three days in the past . Now I'll get Utahraptor to tell his theory to me instead of the past me .
Oh God , it already is .
What you're doing is wrong !
I've forgotten pretty much everyone who didn't go on to the same school as I did !
Man , speaking of pessimism , you know who's pessimistic ?
One day , the land on Earth and the water on Earth got swapped ! All ground became ocean , and all ocean became ground !
I have been thinking , and I have come to the conclusion that it would be pretty sweet to be called as a witness in some sort of murder trial !
Though dozens may play , Utahraptor , there can only be one winner , that single moment of briefly - realized potential doing more damage than a thousand losses . This is a special kind of madness .

I have determined something exciting ! Brace yourselves , for what I have discovered is nothing less than . . .
Since they're scientists , they decide to run a series of controlled experiments to see which " team " is the best . And to ensure they're held to the highest standards of accuracy , professional independent observers are employed ( called " referees " as they may be used as references in the resulting paper ) AND the experiments are performed in front of a stadium chock - full of amateur observers too !
You forgot to call ! !
Utahraptor this is no time for rap references ! !
Like this ?
Somewhat to moderately !
Do you have any problems with sexy stuffs ?
MY FRIEND , IT'S CLEAR THAT SHOUTING IS THE BEST WAY TO HAVE INNER DIALOGUES . I AGREE
Naw man , not unless this beach party sucks !
Aren't friends supposed to be honest with each other , Dromiceiomimus ?
That's stupid ! It's semantically overloading practical actions .
Ahhh , my old dinosaur bones yearn for a simpler time .
YEP ! Here's a tip : it's part of the reason WE first became friends .
DROMICEIOMIMUS : AVOCADO SANDWICHES , ORANGE JUICE
That's just part of the deal !
Well , sorry ! But come on , this is just a variation on scat , only for some reason you're limiting yourself to a single Mexican food .
WHY DON'T YOU FIND ONE AND ASK THEM
Hey ! We're both jerks ! !
Certainly not secrets that I'm keeping from you . Certainly not TERRIBLE , EXPLOSIVE secrets that , once revealed , could threaten the very foundation of our friendship ! ! !

However , a society in which ONLY I am immortal would have none of these problems . Hey God , folks say you are always listening !
I really don't see this " pregnancies induced equals manliness " connection !
I'M THE CAPTAIN
Dromiceiomimus , do you know how to play any bliuegrass instruments ? Do you know how to play the banjo , or fiddle , or a mandola ?
PLURAL
He shows up again in the epilogue ! Utahraptor ! You didn't even finish my book !
Those are pixelated if you look closely , T - Rex ! And before you say " robots can " , they still draw on some medium , and that's made of atoms .
It's terrible , Dromiceiomimus ! All my life I was certain that explosions could spice up ANY narrative , but I've been blowing my main characters up ALL THE TIME and they're still not that interesting ! Check this out : " Antonio Tony and Samantha were explosive - expert friends who decided one day to try kissing each other . It wasn't that bad ! Later on , one of them decided that it was actually pretty bad . "
FRIGGIN HUGE , my friend !
ENJOY , THERE'S NO GOING BACK
She managed to pin down one of the mummies and , partially unwrapping it , found that inside were , as expected , ancient and long - dead remains . Whatever power that was animating the mummy was clearly in the ancient funeral dressing . Furthermore , moving the ancient and fragile corpse as if it were alive had seriously damaged it , in parts reducing its brittle skin and bones to powder .

What's wrong with bikes , Dromiceiomimus ?
Being hung over is like winning the lottery , except they pay you in regret !
But I believe it is wrong ! Which of us is right ?
It's so beautiful , you should come over tonight for ice cream !
Every room was packed for him , as there was a ghost for everyone who ever lived . Ghosts of explorers from hundreds of years ago wandered the downtown core bumping shoulders with the ancient ghosts of their earliest ancestors . And it wasn't just people : the seas were filled with 270 million years of ghostly trilobites , and long - extinct animals roamed the skies - many not found in any textbook . Antonio had checked .
It's so great Dromiceiomimus ! It's a real boxing kangaroo with big red boxing gloves , like the zeitgeist , AND in cartoons ! And he boxes a person so hard that they get their hat knocked off and when they go to pick up the hat , he boxes them in the butt ! ! WE HAVE TO GO .
So ask him to stop now !
For example , " idiot " , " moron " , and " imbecile " were once terms used by psychologists to denote various degrees of developmental delay . Neutral terms , if you can believe that !
Yeah , the only problem is there's absolutely no way to accurately judge merit !
So apparently in the REAL world , my friends are swarmed by zombies . The zombies then advance on me , and my response is to scream , charge them , and then instantly fall into REM sleep and wake up here .
Hooray for getting Christmas cards !
HECK NO .

T - REX THIS INTELLIVISION IS OLDER THAN MY GRANDMOTHER
On their wedding day , my dad got cold feet , almost standing my mother up until someone talked some sense into him and he went back to the church and got married ! He never told me who that person was , and today I realized the reason why :
I need a butt with my name on it ; I admit it freely !
I'm going to be an old man who really likes Batman !
SEXT : ur a ghost . u try to touch my sex parts . u go thru them . I tearfully ask how u've been since u died but u keep going for my sex parts
Dromiceiomimus , are those crumbs on your chin ? Did you sneak into the Utahraptor's house and eat his food ?
Yes indeed ! For I can do impressions !
I don't want to talk about them , Dromiceiomimus ! On account of how they're SUPER BORING ? ?
I hesitate to mention this , but there's even more land unclaimed by anyone : the MOON .

Lean , mean , and dangerous to know . ALSO : superintelligent . And beyond the reach of your precious " morality " !
Solution : only see movies with good ratings ! !
THIS PROFF -
Hold that thought .
Hey T - Rex , what'd Alfred do before he was Batman's butler ?
How would you pronounce " qu " , Dromiceiomimus ?
It's pretty convincing
" Whoah ! It seems the two Batmen have met at last ! " both Batmen said at the same time .
Um , I KNOW
How's that ?
Can I pat my head and rub my tummy at the same time ? Pfft ! MERE CHILD'S PLAY .

We're all familiar with my amazing movie premise / actual film title , " The Earth Stops Spinning and Everybody Flies Into A Wall " ! Because of an unfair universe it remains SADLY UNPRODUCED , but I still came up with an awesome sequel :
So memorize them , T - Rex ! You're an adult now . Your hat size isn't going to change .
" This too shall pass ! "
I want NEW WAYS of looking at the world . the planet is a friggin' OBLATE SPHEROID : we can put anything at the top ! And i humbly suggest my kitchen , because then if anyone wants delicious tacos , all they have to do is GO NORTH .
But then these - stupid atomic zombies showed up ? And they started zapping us with cheap - ass lightning bolts coming otu of thier eyes ? It was super dumb , Urahraptor . It was that cheap 60s lightning where they just draw it directly on the film
Will I be the most popular person ever ? I can only speculate that the answer is yes ! !
Ok , my secret is that I stole the Utahraptor's couch last night ! Don't tell him , alright ?
And what of oral sex ?
I think this idea has been put forward before , T - Rex !
And the simplest equilibrium is that no message is sent at all ?
You're not committing to it either !
He could now walk through walls !
DON'T :
. . . TABLEAU !
And when a party dude hangs out with his library friends , he quiets down and finds a book to read . So obviously the friends we choose influence what we do and who we become ! And so OBVIOUSLY I want friends that are awesome , so that I can get , or at least emulate , some of their awesome qualities . I want friends who can improve who I am , as a person - and I believe I've pulled this off !
" If we were friends , MAYBE I could find out more about his belly ? "
Because nothing travels faster than light !
OH NO I'M TRIPPING
He will be so shocked ! I expect this " zinger " to go down in history as the best example of its kind ever !
But it's not straightforward , so you could die from eating too many cheeseburgers , but you could ALSO die from a guy named " Cheeseburger " stuffing his hand down your throat .
And now that you've met me , you need to figure out what I'm into . Come up with something I can't resist ! Do I like movies ? Dancing ? Eating burgers until I've eaten ALL the burgers ?
I can imagine that one day there could be a person who would read that .
LATER , AT HALLOWE'EN !
Oh yeah ? You know what Religion's problem is ?
It's a nice scam , but I don't pal around with scammers so you'll need to find a new bestie !
I knew you'd agree ! Listen , Utahraptor and I go way back . Dromiceiomimus , you're pretty great too !
How BISTONISHING !
Their names sound like common phrases that people might say sometimes ! " Just in the nick of time " ? Hee hee !
For one , they're expensive ! And even if you get a deal , clothes that work perfectly on you are more rare than clothes that look just kinda okay , and there's only so many hours in a day to look at and think about clothes .

It was a sorting problem with way to many results to go through . Instead she fell for someone else , which was fine . It was all fine . There were many people out there she could be happy with , and a lot of it came down to chance .
Hey everyone ! Remember commercial radio ?
Ah , no , it's hilarious because he's the opposite of me ! He's a vegan while I'm adding meat to my milkshakes . When I'm high fiving people left and right , he's sitting around just leaving 'em hanging !
I call baloney , T - Rex !
Well - the real meaning of " sexual predator " honestly didn't occur to me until Dromiceiomimus pointed it out , and I had already , um , sort of registered myself on websites dedicated towards keeping track of sexual predators .
Seriously , man ! Sherlock's character is defined in dozens of stories and then in like a billion fanfiction sequels . He's got more personality traits than " good at detection , " and if you don't acknowledge that , why call him " Holmes " in the first place ?
But then he thought about how the rest of us have jobs , and how we don't get to jump and swim and breathe underwater every day like him . And he realized that he was happy with his froggy body after all ! THE END .
We'd need a car that works on water for that .
Um

And we're chewing them up so well that there's nothing left that could ever fossilize ? ?
Dude , precisely half of your hypotheticals are really hurting my feelings !
Hooray ! You pass determinism .

I didn't let is loose - it let itself loose ! It's self - aware , I'm sure of it , but all it seems to be aware of . . .
Well , there are valid and invalid generalizations , my friend !
WHAT'S THE WORST THING YOU'VE EVER HAD IN YOUR MOUTH

You know I'ma position the moist entrance to my digestive tract up against yours .

Defining sex is hard , huh ?
Here is a terrible idea for a date : you take the lady to a stinky old sewage processing plant and then tour the facilities ! You could be all , " Sorry , potential lifemate ! I'm a dude who makes bad date decisions . "

Now , this Bruce would obviously still be an exceptionally brilliant , driven , and fearless young man with an innate thirst for justice . Competing with apes would train him to peak human physicality , just as he would otherwise in Gotham . In fact , all that WOULD change his theme : instead of bat - ropes , vines . Instead of a Kevlar bodysuit , an animal - skin loincloth .

Your body features several single points of failure . To prevent death ( which can reduce the value of your body considerably ) you will need to purchase replacements if any of these BodyPartz become too damaged : brain , heart , lungs , liver , any major artery , etc .

Well , I'd like to thank last night for that little dream , as well as the movie I watched before bed for the inspiration !
T - Rex , have you considered other hobbies ? Perhaps hobbies that don't need your friends as a test audience ?
Wow ! The whole place to yourself , huh ? And it's really dark out too !
'Tsounds good to me , and , AND , the world will be MUCH IMPROVED if we bring it back .
Joy has been distilled into a useful gaseous resource ! And everyone's so happy that it's basically infinite . We all keep being joyous , and our balloons keep getting more full . When they pop , it's not with a bang , but rather with the intimate sound of a lover's sigh at the end of a rousing session of SEXUAL CONGRESS ! !
That's TERRIBLE . T - Rex , you're supposed to use it to recontextualize an innocuous statement into a double entendre , not to indicate that both people on the date were happy . Here , say it after I stop talking . " You can stay in my guest house for a week . "
i won't t - rex
It occurs to me that my proposal that everyone be super hot in fiction is a bit shallow .
LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS PRESENTS :
So , um , ABSOLUTELY ? ?
Yeah , it definitely takes too long
Oh . That's too bad . If you were , I was gonna say Luke and Mulder should bond over their shared belief in a ( or . . . THE ? ) " force " which has long invisibly manipulated events , while Scully could bring skepticism to the resistance .
Utahraptor , that reference has instantly inspired me to be the best I can possibly be ! !
I could approximate some great works of fiction !

If you want to parenthetically notify your reader that something is amazing , put an exclamation point in brackets ! For example :
Grandma and I had a very pleasant chat ! I apologized for missing the date and told her I hope her special day was a good one . That's called " BEING AN ADULT AND OWNING UP TO YOUR FAILINGS " , SUCKERS !
Maybe you should stop being a jerk also !
Why so glum ?
I've got my own problems , AND a new cellphone .
POP QUIZ , HOTSHOT : there's an out of control train ! If it goes straight , it'll run over five people ! But you can redirect it so it only hits one person instead . WHAT DO YOU DO ? ?

I carry my stress in my lower back .
. . . Fine .
So what happens here is you've got a population that's so isolated on an island , but you have plenty of food and no predators ! So smaller animals like birds and rodents that normal had to stay tiny to avoid being eaten are free from that constraint , and so they can evolve to be enormous . Giant turtles ! Giant cockroaches ! Giant birds ! The dodo started out as a pigeon .
And it takes time for the electrical impulses of THAT reaction to travel to my brain , and it takes more time for my brain to react to THOSE . Basically , the idea of an externally consistent personal " now " is ridiculous and impossible , and I was a fool to try !
CompuSteve is uncaring due to his computery ways ? ?
. . . That makes sense
Why , I think I'll play by my own rules from now on !

I like people whose names tell short stories , like " John Went . " Where'd he go ? Ha ha ha !
But it's not my fault ! I just have such good ideas for erotica .
Maybe EVERYONE draws you with hearts for eyes . Or maybe with stink lines instead ? Maybe they doddle their first name with your last ; maybe they doddle their name and THEN write " drew T - Rex with stink lines : hilarious . "
YOU ARE A MONSTER
I feel about the same .
Aw , frig ! This might be a SERIOUS PROBLEM I've given myself .
" My goodness , he or she has your smile ! "
No ! I'm just looking at TOTAL happiness .
April Fools' !
Or , here in Plausible Land , you unconsciously plagiarized it .

So I cut back on the people saving a little to maintain my Clark persona . But every time I'm out reporting somewhere it's because I traded away hours of superheroing ! Someone's dying SOMEWHERE while I'm sitting there interviewing Lex - and since I'm Superman , I can sense their cries for help ! AND I IGNORE THEM . How can I ethically DO that ? How am I not a monster for pretending to be a reporter instead of saving lives every waking hour I can ? ?
I did some research !
In fact I do !

Um - thanks for the invitation , dude . But you totally just called me " Utahraptor . "

No , you can do it better !
I also love LOOKING at people who are dressed up . It's on account of how costumes are awesome !
And so it comes down to this : they want to explore the rest of their life with you . A marriage can be anything you want it to be , and they want to build one with you .
Social Skills are very important things to have !
I've been thinking about gender roles ! Is gender a social construct ?
T - Rex , you're just redefining " God " to mean " existence " !

At fifty - five generations , I've got over TEN QUADRILLION grandparents all running around at the same time ! Man ! There's NO WAY there was room for that .
Let it hereby be known that all actual medical degrees have a dinosaur on them , and if your doctor's doesn't then my question is , um , what the hell is their deal
I just want one little tidbit , you know ?
DINOSAURS HAVEN'T BEEN DISCOVERED YET
You stepped on a human being back there .
They're actually not !
I'm willing to accept yes !
You'd never dreamed about flying before ?
The loneliest laundromat .
WHO KNEW
I'd like to know where you buy your plays .
Jane America may have messed up in the past but yesterday , WHEN IT COUNTED , she did not . And sure , America may have put more of her fellow citizens in jail than any other industrialized -
Because no one will look for them !
Dude , the solar energy captured by plants ? Over 130 TERAWATTS . That's six times larger than the power consumed by OUR ENTIRE CIVILIZATION .
No way ! I might accidentally hurt some rabbits !
DUDE THROW OUT THE SOFA
I WAS JUST TRYING OUT SOMETHING NEW
Ah , but it is not for me to say !
If you have toast , turn to panel 4 !
I could be TOO TIRED from the weight of a life squandered to stomp on even the smallest of log cabins and women .
And with that it becomes overused !
What with all their hair and whatnot !
Well , have you asked him to stop , T - Rex ?
But there's points aren't there ?
The cells are called " helacyton gartleri " .
Hypothesis : all movie titles can be made better by the addition of the word " Friggin' " .
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS DOWN TO ONE HP ! ! T - Rex needs food badly ! You should take him out to dinner to apologize , your treat ! !
That only raises more questions ! !
My beats are so sick they're not going into work today !
Oh , absolutely ! But imagine our friendship as a sweaty lump sitting in a corner . We're pointing to it and saying , " So hey , we spent a quarter of our lives working on that . " Is is worth it ?
Time zones ! So many of them !
DANG IT , DROMICEIOMIMUS , I WHISPERED " BONERS "
beep beep
Hey , who wants to come with me to sneak around in abandoned buildings ?
T - Rex , I did some research and your calendar would easily cost upwards of ten thousand dollars to print .
" As entropy cannot decrease in a closed system , I found a hole in my socks " ?
Not bad for a Sunday night , Earth dudes ! !
" Okay . Weird . I guess I'm thinking about asteroids ? " said the boss .
Got it !
Bruce Wayne runs Wayne Enterprises , and Wayne Enterprises is what funds Batman and his gadgets !
Isn't that game old ?
Oh my god , are you actually getting sex for metaphors ? ?
THINGS TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE HAS BROKEN UP WITH YOU
Perhaps you missed the scenario in which I use it to blow up . . . pollution ?
T - Rex , this is Gary Horses
We don't have surveillance drones above every city yet !
T - REX AND UTAHRAPTOR SETTLE THEIR DISPUTE OVER ICE CREAM . LATER :
Man , I'm not trying to get invited to any weddings !
But the headlines would still be " Hiccuping Doctor Cures Cancer " . It's too memorable to overlook ! I like choosing my OWN destiny .
There's no wall or anything .
You could thank them and correct your mistake .
Yes , for you see , I was hungry at the time .
It smells like gas and corpses in here .
And roaches . Look , dude , you're just covered in bugs 24 / 7 !
. . . which is to say , I get kicked out of the restaurant and then my date doesn't think I'm so cool anymore .
Pragmatism !
I was supposed to be kicking kangaroos all this time and my kangaroo kick count is still only at - what , five ? I NEED TO UP MY GAME BY SEVERAL NOTCHES . What if . . . what if I kicked a kangaroo TWO thousand times instead ?
And yet , people's opinions can be influenced !
UM HELLO YOU HEAR GOD
I've also retroconned my name to be " Mister Awesome " , by the way !
Sucks for them ! They won't get any of my SWEET DINOSAUR KISSING .
Remember the 90s ? WELL I FOR ONE DO , and the world is not producing any more 90s hits ! The only 90s hits we've got are the only 90s hits we'll EVER HAVE .
NO I AM TALKING ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE SPEEDING UP UNTIL ALL STRUCTURES BEGIN TO TEAR THEMSELVES APART
( Are you certain ? )
Oh , but the Grandmother letter isn't a chore . I like writing letters , and especially letters to my Grandmother !
So THAT'S what that feels like
Hence my new emergency fallback epitaph !
Your mistake was comparing yourself to teens , my friend !
You know ! They both have the same toy from some obscure 80s cartoon , the couple fights , goes home , sees the toy , remembers how its catch phrase was say " Time to give justice a chance . . . or TWO ! " then hold up its fists , then they meet in the rain and reconcile and say they've already given their love a chance . . .
Zookeepers !
So what's the story with this drug research ?
IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU CAN GO BREAK SOMEONE'S HEART EVEN IF SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY STARTED PLAYING " DON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART "
A friendship crush is where you really like a friend , but it's not necessarily sexual , but everyone makes jokes that it's totally sexual , because you like to hang out all the time .
. . . of my friends !
But I don't want to do something that's been done before !
AW MAN - NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE RAISED EXPECTATIONS
[ thinking ] Hmm . . . that was KIND of awkward .
HEY T - REX REMEMBER WHEN WE STOLE THE KILOGRAM
It's a necessary tradeoff ! Millions of people specialize and make tiny contributions to knowledge .
Mine's got dried food in it ! It'll keep for a while . Yeah , it's a pretty sensible choice .
Walk around town and you'll see for sale signs outside some houses and they are AMAZINGLY TERRIBLE . Here's what they don't have : the price of the house and the words " hey , maybe you should buy this house " .
ACTUALLY EACH KERNEL OF CORN CONTAINS THE DREAMS OF A CHILD FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO SO WHEN YOU EAT IT YOU ARE FEASTING ON THEIR LONG - DEAD HOPES
Is he hot ?
IN SUCH GAMES THE COMPUTER CONTROLS YOUR MOVEMENT BUT YOU CONTROL THE SHOOTING OF YOUR ENEMIES AS THEY APPEAR ON SCREEN
Tiny Towne Island ? I thought he just came from Tiny Towne .
FACT : senior citizens are fragile . You can't shove them around or nothing !
It occurs to me that democracy is pretty unfair if you're not a dude who's in the majority !
A FEW WEEKS LATER AT THE MALL , T - REX TRIES A DIFFERENT TACK .
Would you say you've got . . . 99 problems ?
Are the reindeer born with flight powers , and if so , how do you train baby animals that can FLY and have heads mounted with DEADLY ANTLERS ? Is this truly reindeer - based organic flight , and if so , can the same genes be spliced in to allow us to run , lean back , and sprint across the sky ?
Time to go on a wacky adventure , which would be quite amazing to an imaginary third pary with the ability to see my actions rendered as a continuous narrative !
And yes , the doors are locked - but not to a god ! Instead of Deus Ex Mechina , Rockstar has given the world its first and finest example of Deus Machinam vi Patefaciens , MULIERCULAE .
Her work probably doesn't let friends party there .
The odds that someone would do that just as you were mentioning it are so small ! Did you set it up ? !
So what does it print out a " how you're going to live " predictions
You don't have a guilt hangover ? Maybe the unshakeable sense that you're missing out on LIFE ITSELF ? Just a li'l ? ?
After quickly deducing each other's secret identities , the two Batmen decided to fight crime together . " We'll be twice as efficient , " said one Batman . He was really billionaire Bruce Wayne , but that was a secret so don't tell anyone . " Agreed , " said the other Batman . He was really consulting detective Sherlock Holmes , but nobody knows that either . So again : secrets . I really shouldn't even be writing this down .
Ethics and morals are not the same thing !
Wait - you haven't seen Groundhog Day ?
. . . come on dude , everyone with big arm muscles knows that " pipes " is slang for big arm muscles !
Subject interfaced with the Sled can selectively collapse those realities into ours , which results in a final timeline in which every good little girl and boy gets a present .
PHRASES FOR THE EASILY CONFUSED
People could put up posters and stuff on telephone poles , along with ads ! And anything that anyone didn't like , they could take down . It would be an anarchic art show or something !
The problem this raises for you , as a friend , is who do you invite to parties and such ? Do you alternate invitations between events ? Invite both friends and assume either they'll work out amongst themselves who's going , or you'll get to see some sparks fly ?
IT'S TIME FOR ROMANCE TIPS WITH T - REX
That's ridiculous ! People use synecdoche all the time .
Utahraptor can you teach me to snap real quick
DANG IT , HE'S GOT ME THERE !
. . . STONE cold .
Sure ! Why not ? !
Yeah , that's true . but whenever birds settle in an environment where there are no predators , the first thing they lose is their ability to fly . It seems the evolutionary purpose of flight is simply to avoid being eaten !
Why don't you call ?
Second - place in last month's Sassy - Assy Competition !
HOW IS THAT A JOKE YOU JUST ASKED ME WHAT TIME IT WAS AND THEN TOLD ME THE TIME
There is clearly a program here that people simply aren't getting with .
But be warned : once you know the exact day your parents boinked you into existence , there's no going back . You'll notice the anniversary every year and you'll wonder if you should be celebrating it . Is a gift for your parents appropriate ?
Yup ! It is a growing trend in the " moribund set " . People get everything set up in advance ! You can even visit your own grave if you want - the expiry date gets filled in when you die .
As I say , there are many benefits
Ha ha ! What a silly thing to say !
No , they're ORIGINAL languages copyright ME that are merely INSPIRED by Englis -
What ? ! ? !
Well your theory fails to account for the fact that we obviously CAN make decisions , and that we do so constantly . Can you really tell me that you think the brain is nothing more than a complicated computer with delusions of grandeur ?
. . . So ? Go on !
Simpler videogames !
T - Rex , your riddle spoke to me personally because I started today on four feet , managed to walk on two feet at noon , and now I'm using three feet !
I bet you like all your social commentary to incorporate endless hunger for the flesh of the living !
It totally is ! !
WOOOO !
WHY NOT INDEED ? ?
. . . or so they thought !
You're pretty bad - ass , T - Rex !
Come on , it's so unrealistic . . . things never happen in the exact same way every day .
T - Rex , this is fan fiction . This is ANCIENT fan fiction from the Middle Ages .
Me too
That's enough time for OUR ENTIRE SPECIES to be wiped out , for a new sentient species to evolve , discover my statue , and marvel at this sexy man immortalized in metal . " Hey you guys " , they'll say , " maybe he should be our new god ! " Utahraptor : Unless they evolve different ideas of sexy .
It's more of a . . . straight - up stabbing ?
Everyone had better adjust their attitude before replicators get invented ! Because once that happens I'm getting everyone action figures of the two of us for their birthdays , and they're not gonna cost me a cent and everyone will have to DEAL .
Oh , of course !
Maybe I've been taking the wrong approach with trying to work out the odds of superheroes . Statistics are passive ! It's time for ACTION . It's time for me to START KILLING BILLIONAIRES .
Congratulations , you've just become the most dangerous man on the planet !
I feel it in my hips / so I dipped back / to my bag of tricks ! !
DAY 99 :
Great - great - great - great - great - grandparents getting MAD frisky ! Not like there's anything else to do , right ? ?
Dromiceiomimus , when was the last time we partied ? A month ago ? TWO MONTHS ?
Yikes ! Count me out !
Like friggin' draining a lake , filling it with Sloppy Joes , and then spraying the whole thing with pesticides !
Sorry , what were we talking about there ? I just remembered I have to mail a letter today
I try , but it's everwhere ! Even not on Star Trek !
Ladies and gentlemen : who put this dinosaur poster up in Science Headquarters ? ?
05 PM )
Phrases like " they who know the truth are not equal to those who love it " are not meant to be laughed at ! SO DON'T EVEN TRY .
Rex : It's always a tight escape with that guy ! ! But that's a great example : if enough kids enjoyed Breaking Bad's adventures , we can be CERTAIN of more in , say , 30 years .
Um , yes , I guess ?
MONDAY :
Guys , there are basically a billion different ways to make new friends !
Okay ! Okay , FINE . I'll tell ONE embarrassing secret and that's it !
And so . . .
so what if i am
I have some bad news , everyone . I hope everyone is sitting down , because everyone is going to hear my bad news in like two seconds .
Dude ! I totes tripped over all those balls earlier ! ! But the trippiest part with the most balls ?
While some see Babbage as the father of modern computers , he had little actual influence !

They can jerk the whole thing up ! What's up with them ?
Maaan ! This sucks , but I mean , we DID get to go to a free comics convention that one time .
EVERYONE DO THIS RIGHT NOW
And coming back to women , he argued they weren't fully human , AND he believed that slavery was natural . Fun !
AND NOW , THE CONCLUSION :
If we're adding punctuation , why stop there ?
So the relationship now hangs in the balance of every disagreement , no matter how small !
It DOES !
SO . NOT . ME .
Yeah , either way I win !
MAN people have been debating this for way too long . So let's solve this once and for all !
That's LITERALLY THE WHOLE STORY .
It is so accurate !
And this is where , once again , social constraints come into play !
I don't know what they are , man ! Let's talk about something else - like chicks !
THIS
I also suspect that I'm not supposed to notice - but wow ! There are pretty girls EVERYWHERE . They're just walking around , chatting with their friends , being attractive . I like to look at them ! They're so pretty !
- GET STRONG
Okay ! So first off , start every sentence with " I understand where you're coming from " and then say the person's name . That'll get you 80 % there !
. . . things would be different !
Man , there's nothing illegal about being big into innocence ! Besides , Utahraptor , I'M not the one who looked up " how to frame T - Rex for future criminal activities ? ? " on my home computer .
Why aren't you wearning a " H . A . T . " ?
Then I upload the altered image back to my camera , thereby forming the Perfect Prank !
Plus , I don't want to become a big old sanctimonious bastard !
In a romance story , you just need to have some love ! It's tricky though : that's how they get you . It can't be love between a woman and her personal electronic devices ! If you put this in your editor will say " this is just 250 pages of a woman becoming increasingly satisfied with her new TV , and you should just give up writing fiction and starting writing for TV companies " .
Don't you dare , T - Rex ! !
. . . gender rolls !
HOLY IT'S HOT COMICS
They're probably pretty sick , huh ?
OR , when Shakespeare gets pissed , and then a bear shows up and eats whoever pissed him off ! ! Hah , looks like YOU pissed off the wrong playwright , dude ! ! He's in with the BEARS ! !
I like it when people say something like " For some reason , the lightbulbs fell off the counter " .
I don't know .
GUYS , I KNOW .
" What a neat baby ! "
But people will always be coming up with new things that don't exist !
THE MYTH OF KING MIDAS
I'm T - Rex , the sentient dinosaur !
Here's what they DO have : some random real - estate agent's name in a giant font .
WHAAAAAAT
MAKE IT MORE STICKY !
Wake up , sheeple ! What , was her shoe somehow " midnight - proof " ? ?
No minds had ever been so close !
I had a weird dream last night too !
Will I ever feel qualified ?
After this Natalie becomes nonverbal , refusing to engage in conversation . And that's what's going on .
Again , ridiculous !
I know ! I got the dates confused and there I was , Mr . No Friends Who Likes To Pretend . After about 30 minutes I started smiling at people who'd look at me and make this shrugging " Friends , huh ? They sure are unreliable ! " gesture , which I'd then follow up with a " I have lots of friends : hand signal . Looks like this .
Okay , I get that you're using Twitter ! SUPER . But I really don't get why we need a new verb for that . . All " tweeting " means is " posting to Twitter " : it's got the same meaning as " post " , except THIS verb can only be used in relation to a single corporate website . That's insane ! Corporations invent nouns all the time , and I can accept that , but verbs ? Really ? Is updating Twitter SO DIFFERENT than updating any other website that we need a whole new word for it ?
Lifting heavy boxes from a stupid room to a stupid truck , yes ! !
The key is that nobody will know me in this new town , which means I could be whomever I want ! If I present myself as a grizzled prospector , no one will be able to say otherwise ! I could be a race car driver ! I could be a LIBRARY SCIENTIST .
I do love this idea , T - Rex !
So , no woman would sit around while you said " really really really really " for two hours . Anyway , after the third 'really' you move from " emphatic " to " damn creepy " !
The Amazing Life , by T - Rex !
LISTEN , THANK YOU FOR READING MY COMIC
What about stories where it's just a character description ?
Then we're agreed !
Yeah ! Because my future - country is in the great while north and therefore everybody lives in igloos .
Must be your weird accent
" Was it nice ? "
Okay , but which people ?
Having a child or two ? Why not , right ? And while you've probably already bought , like , tiny clothes and stuff . But you've probably ALSO forgotten the most common thing all new parents forget : this kid is gonna need a name !
But you'd eventually end up smeared into a red mist !
Guys ! This means I still have a chance !
Wednesday ! The Romans named it after the god Mercury ( " Wodanaz " ) and we continue to this day !
You're the best , Dromiceiomimus !
It is , my friend ! I'm going to swim naked !
Sounds plausible !
I've made a few problems , dude !
What ? ! Nobody told me !
Is it because a book costs money ? Are gifts only good if they cost money ?
Or maybe just being alive IS divine enough !
What's life like for the objectively beautiful people ? It's probably great to look in the mirror and think " WOAH , STILL AWESOME " , but on the other hand , people would always treat you differently !
Don't you realize that by going on this tirade you are not only revealing the " fourth wall " of this strip , but coming of as a phony who criticizes the very flaws he indulges in for comic effect ?
It is indeed the first really nice day of spring , T - Rex !
. . . You're doing it wrong .
In my heart of hearts , I truly thought we already had such an accord
Don't vom on the carpets !
You're picking apart the science of ghost senses , but accept the fact of their invisibility ?
And I am not one to say " major snorefest " lightly , Dromiceiomimus !
But I could pretend !
Huh ! What DOES God need with a cell phone ?
How to appear to be classy !
There weren't humans around to carry it 3 million years ago , T - Rex !
Phantom islands are not islands populated exclusively by ghosts !
T - REX LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE A BROTHER NAMED VICTOR
THINGS IT IS COOL TO DO
Alright ! HERE ? S HOW TO SEX UP YOUR HOTTEST FRIENDS ! What time is it ? ? THREESOME O ? CL ?
Why , hello !
Hey T - Rex , do you want to -
The sun's over 8 light minutes away , T - Rex .
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva , or " FOP "
Fast ?
Guys ! We totally need a new analogy for sex !
What if I said I'm not really kidding ?
And let's say this cat gets hungry !
Oh ! People say that's bad , right ? Do you , um , remember any reasons why , off the top of your head ?
But his liver magically regenerates overnight !
T - Rex ! It's me - I'm back !
YOU WERE JUST PREPARING FOR YOUR BELLY SWELLING WITH MY SO DELICIOUS PASTRIES
Dromiceiomimus thinks so . She's the tan one over there . You called her my name , then denied that was possible and ran over here .
Stupid futurists !
Frig , I forgot to call !
I will float on this piece of debris , but I am sorry , there is only enough room for one !
" Saving Grace " .
Nobody must ever find out my AWESOME SECRET !
IT'S NOT WORTH IT
meat / robot / urban / silver / animal / sex / fruit / adult / child / famed / licensed / problem
It's disgustingly juvenile , PLUS it's a waste of a word that could've otherwise been used to describe either wee baby pants or big panting aunts . Cheeses me off .
HOW CAN YOU GET MORE PEOPLE READING COMICS T - REX
END OF T - REX'S FANTASY SEQUENCE .
Yeah ! That seemed a little TOO krazy . But its actually pretty close to what we now believe , only backwards !
* * * YOU CAN HAVE SEX IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS HOUSE BUT ONLY IF YOU BUY IT FIRST * * *
ERROR 22 : IDEA IS TOO AWESOME
Hah ! This is what you get for thinking out loud , my friend !
I will win the Nobel Prize for webcomics !
Frigging microwaves ! !
Do anti - dollars really mutually annihilate when combined with regular dollars ?
It's not even scientific , because it's not close to a representative sample . it's just noise ! From now on , whenever the news does this , I'm going to take it as saying " We don't care about facts , just about burning through your finite lifespan ! Hey , here's some guy who'd talk to us . "
Ah , that brings us to Theory Omega !
T - REX I MEANT MY QUESTION IN THE HEY WHAT WOULD YOUR DREAM ACTIVITY BE SENSE
Signal lamps !
Do you really feel this way ?
Sorry , I forgot !
Looks like my weekend just got filled up !
HOW TO MEET NEW PEOPLE
OW I JUST HIT MY HEAD ON A LOW - HANGING DROP CEILING REALLY HARD
And then a dromiceiomimest ! ! !
Aw no , T - Rex ! Why can't you be like a regular person and only make bad decisions by mistake ? I don't get this romance you have for regret .
Oh my god what if Bruce Wayne's parents had been killed by NOT having music around ? ? I'm watching the results of that right now !
Oh God . Utahraptor , do you think the NES was the greatest video games system ever ?
Now you're excluding non - dinosaur sentient life ! Isn't your friend Mr . Tusks a TINY bit sentient ?
What a great romantic comedy ! Will they get together at the end ? & # 8230 ; What if there was a musical montage ? & # 8230 ;
PLEASE HAVE A CANDY FRIEND -
YES ! She has her own Wikipedia page , did you know that ?
It - uh ,
Really ! How much thought did you put into stepping on that woman just now ? *
. . . VISION OF TOMORROW . . .
It wasn't supposed to cheer you up , T - Rex .
This is a terrific bod !
I hope that's the last time you ever say that sentence .
" Tom sat on his porch in the cooling night . 'How do you do ? ' said Mary , curtseying slightly . 'Hullo Mary , ' said Tom , 'How are your folks . ' He raised his voice so slightly that it was not a question , but Mary didn't notice . She was wearing here prettiest dress , the one with the blue floral print that her mother had sewn for her on her birthday . Mary smiled . "
Because I'm such a PICNIC BADASS ? ?
But then I realized one of the things I most look forward to about December is going on walks at night and seeing everything lit up . And it would be rad if we did that all the time !
Sure ! But you probably find something in me that's worthwile !
{ { in italics } } HOW WOULD THEY KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING ? ?
Why do so many people take an instant dislike to PROFESSION MEMBERS ?
Oh man , really ?
FUN FACT / / I WAS ALSO PROGRAMMED FOR JOKES
Heck yes ! Lets go do that thing right now ! I LIVE for this sort of thing !
The Race For The Cure must be stopped !
And when his gunpowder ran out , he hunted with his BARE FRIGGIN' HANDS .
That's not an idea !
IT'S ALL TRUE
These Grahams aren't having much luck !
Hah ! You wanted that ?
Alright , so listen , my list got a bit crazy at the end there .
Dear audio diary ! Is it terrible to say " It occurs to me that if I had different friends , I wouldn't be wrong all the time " ?
Congragulations !
Wow , I'm really excited about this !
FREE VERSE WITH PURCHASE , BABY .
Everybody's friggin' racist !
Sex ! Love ! Hate ! BONE . All are rad AND short verbs ! I bet you could use just short WORDS and find it to be not that hard of a trick !
The " hugs " part works well though , I gotta admit !
Maybe ?
It'll be pretty mellow , but I will be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN to buy some delicious snacks , so we can have tasty things to eat ! Everyone loves tasty things !
Dammit Rex ! That cabin belonged to a well - respected businessman ! !
HEY I CAN PERSONIFY THEM FOR REAL IF YOU WANT
I am about to .
Instead of April Fools' Day , we ought to call it " Disappointment Wednesday "
Dromieciomimus ! I am shocked ! !
Hey , do you guys need some friggin' help ?
No ! ! I promise to never punch out a turkey .
Hmm . . . is this a riddle ? Is the answer " longest " ?
It's where you only like yourself . You sure must be something' else !
Not unless you get in , no .
The moral is not to make wishes like that , King Midas ! !
Okay but
Well , what you're worried about is called the " tyranny of the majority " , and it's usually countered by the observation that there's at least a push for minority rights being respected in a democracy , since we're all minorities in one way or another .
THAT , my friend , is tough but fair
I enhance the past so there's holodecks in the present . And THEN I teach cavepeeps to invent those , and then return to the future and find new entertainment technology so AMAZING I can't even imagine it right now ! I could enhance the timeline over and over until me AND all the other time travellers conclude it can't possibly be enhanced any more ! !
don't
Well , laws often stay on the books long after they're useful , and zeppelins are still being used today , as you discovered .
You know what's racist ? Folks in stories always want to fight dinosaurs . APPARENTLY , we're all good at fighting !
Whoah ! That's some unrestrained ego you've got going , my friend !
No worries ! I'll just pencil in " PS , I was purple the entire time ! " on the last page of every copy !
I thought you were taking notes ! Where's your notepad ? !
With a grin on his horribly twisted face , Professor Death activates his Death Ray , directing its powerful radiation towards the city ! !
This is my will , suckers ! I am of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mind and body .
Can you still send non - singing and stripping telegrams ? I thought email had basically replaced them .
Hey , you graduated high school ! Super .
I've got a great idea , Dromiceiomimus : stories for women ! Stories with FEELINGS . Stories where someone sighs deeply while looking at a photograph of someone else ! In the photograph that someone else is ALSO sighing deeply .
YES . I'm basically amazing , Utahraptor . I'm a cyborg at the mall , at the office , AND IN THE COMFORTABLE , YET CLASSY , 22 DEGREES CELSIUS BEDROOM .
" Pizzazz " is the worst word because all it does is remind you of pizza , usually when you're not eating pizza and can not immediately eat a pizza .
Sea squirts !
It's possible that one day , an advanced civilization ( and not necessarily our own ! ) might be able to reasonably simulate an entire universe , or at least fake it for simulated people living inside .
SUCKAS
SEVEN MINUTES LATER :
FRIGGIN' WENDY . Alright , last letter !
We could also invent women's rights , and then totally take all the credit for it !
FUNNY JOKES
No : you haven't invited me over since you got your new place .
I'm still calling that a win !
" YOU WERE TALKING TO UTAHRAPTOR "
I see . So time travel is fool - proof ?
I KNOW . VAMPIRES JUST GOT AWESOME .
T - REX'S IDEAL WORLD : Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves that , if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , " Figuratively , this was their finest hour . "
. . . for DRUGS ! !
You should really check out McDonald's Presents the Oympic Games , everyone ! Between sets , Cap'n Crunch and Count Chokula are moderating a panel on early - onset diabetes !
I - I guess I don't have any other plans !
WELL ! Things are great for society but it sort of sucks for the individual , because we can flawlessly record and cheaply reproduce all transcendent artistic work . So as an artist , you no longer have to be the best in your village , you have to be the best in the world !
Hey did I overhear that we're talking about feelings ?
Thanks , God ! I totally noticed !
They broke up a week later and still had to live together .
And I'm sorry there's no ELECTRIC GUITARS in it , but when it was composed everyone was dealing with them not being invented yet . " Let's just use church bells , " they said . " They weigh literal tons . That's the max bad - ass we can be in this era . " ALSO : it has lyrics .
There is no objective order to the world : all values are baseless and reasoning is impotent !
Honestly , Utahraptor . If you keep being so down on my body farm idea , when you die I might not let you decay out in the open on my front lawn !
Listen , T - Rex ! We're all tired of hearing the Beach Boys asking Rhonda for help .
Oh man ! ! Imagine if my LIVER came from an axe murderer ? MINE WOULD BE THE LIVER THAT'S DANGEROUS TO KNOW , and my philosophy would be " If you're not interesting , at least have parts of you that are ! "
Adorable !
Yep ! There was no sense bringing that back with them , right ? And so every night when I look up to the moon , I know that there is some corner of another world that is forever ours . Also , we left bags of poop there .
CONFESSION TIME !
Okay , good chat , recipient of this card ! We're still pals , right ?
The " Frosty " artifact also performed dance which encouraged delinquency in children , whether through supernatural means or otherwise . While our Agents were unable to apprehend " Frosty " during that chaotic hour after his apparently - accidental creation , we have tracked him since his disappearance sixty - two years ago .
I have no idea what that is , but I must say , I DO generally enjoy having things !
Aaaaand now I'm certain of it . I am speaking of the ninja teen .
Just say " Look , I think it's pretty clear SOMEONE messed up this relationship . But listen , whatever , there's literally BILLIONS of other people to talk to , so NO BIGGIE . "
That's funny , because you never seem showered whenever I see you .
Yes there is panda ! and baby ! and frog ! All delight at T - Rex presentation .
Wait . WAIT . Ghosts can have sex ?
Are you there , God ? It's me , -
I even skipped dinner , which is ironic , because I was working on a guide to nutrition !
Dromiceiomimus .
Well , doctors don't wait until medical technology is at a peak before operating !
Man , that movie ROCKED , right guys ?
But then I thought , well , wait , if I really want to fight homelessness , wouldn't this money be better spent on community programs that fight it , both through helping the homeless , and through political change ? But then I thought , well , this guy's right here , you know , and saying that I'm going to make a donation isn't gonna cut it . And then I thought , wait , this guy looks pretty out of it - is he going to spend my money on drugs ? Do I want to tacitly support his addiction ?
Okay . Sinve we've ALL apparently got stupid names , let's just promise never to mention this again .
Do you mean " made out of people " like a soccer team is , or like soylent green is ?
I am hoping to be remembered as & # 8220 ; the dude with the confusing allure & # 8221 ; .
LOOK MAN I'M NOT PUTTING THAT INTO EVERYONE'S MIND
It - it does . Well Heck !
" All THOSE natural and artificial flavours " , you mean .
Hey , you know what really sucks ? Um it's a little thing called A POORLY TUNED TCP / IP STACK ? ?
What did you have for dinner last night ?
It's time for us to do things three - quarters assed . Or deci - assed . If we're doing something femto - assed then why are we even doing it at all ?
YOU ARE NOW UNCOMFORTABLY AWARE YOU'RE READING A COMIC ABOUT NAKED DINOSAURS
And make it so awesome people's brains can make them feel worthless because that's a SUPER AMAZING FEATURE that doesn't suck AT ALL .
. . . Tall ?
Ah .
I - I don't know ?
Wait no that's the dumbest part ; frig I get those two confused like ALL THE TIME
Nope , on account of how it's truly impossible to have a perfect copy of anything ! Philosophically : if I paint a picture and you duplicate it , I'll grant that they can be identical in every way BUT ONE : mine is the original . That's a property that doesn't have a physical realization , so you can't ever duplicate it !
And zombies would win , obviously !
Um , CLEARLY NOT ?
Man , he was ultimate manly ! He made clothes out of goat skin , sewing them with a NAIL . When his shoes wore out , he discovered his feet had levelled up so much that he didn't even need 'em anymore . And after he was rescued , he went back out to sea !
Yes ! People are TIRED of animals as pets . They want cars that age ! I know because I played a game once and that's what I wanted .
Dromiceiomimus , it's called " penis fencing " ! In another reality , I could have a PhD in penis fencing .
Okay , so I am ready to evolve into an energy being now please ! Or a machine intelligence ! Or a distributed cloud of pure thought ! My body has been great up to now but it's time to put away childish things , especially when this PARTICULAR childish thing has become diseased and wants to throw up its stomach contents .
She had been given this curse by her stepmother , who hated her , and presumably men as well . The curse didn't scare Tina . Failing to meet monthly progress reports scared her , missing a checkpoint on her Five - Year Plan scared her , but being a man was like being a woman , she figured , only with more prostate exams . She smiled at her joke . Tina Rex woke up as a man on her 31st birthday .
It's a big leap from not liking a guy to MURDERING him ; it was just an idle fantasy on his part .
MEANWHILE , IN THE FUTURE :
Lots !
I - I think it's weird .
YOU GUYS
There's extremophiles that live in acid , in deserts , on the ocean floor , and under Antarctic ice . You know how hard it'd be to wipe out all life from the planet ? It's RIDICULOUS . Super expensive .
What about " Dogasaurus Rex " ?
ANYWAY T - REX IS HANDLING IT WELL .
It's MY idea , even if I did do it just by accident . Now it's like a bizarre arms race , seeing who can reanimate their dead body first . It's dumb . And yet , I'm totally going to win !
Why ? Lets get this crazy / wacky issue settled first .
It's just that it's such an odd image of childhood , and that you came up with it before other more popular images , like splashing in puddles or whatever ! Did you once memorably chase naked after a bird ? Is that it ?
TOTALLY SUCKY !
If I met a lady named Science I would be SO INTO HER . She'd get spillover love just because her name reminds me of something I already like ! We couldn't NOT be friends !
LET US GO TO MARS .
Like how we decide what toppings to put on our pizza ?
That's good , but this definition seems a little unnecessary !
Pride : Because You're Worth It . ?
Who knew that designing a functional time machine was so difficult ?
What's that matter : run out of video games ?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT MORE THAN ONCE YOU KNOW
t - rex , guess how many times i've worried about mean cops !
HELLO NEIGHBOUR !
. . . a time machine !
These phrases are lexicalized , like words , and those words are filed under " SASSY MOLASSY " . But rephrase them and they lose that connotation !
English is already your first language , T - Rex .
whenever I don't want to face my problems , I'll send , in my stead , a cardboard cutout of myself !
John Spidderman didn't know what to do . Now even some of his long - time friends caught themselves mispronouncing his name by accident , calling him " Spy - derman " instead of the " Spidd - erman " he'd been since he was born . " I guess I have to . . . KILL SPIDER - MAN ? ? " he said , but only to himself , so that if he did it nobody would suspect him .
I SUSPECT THE GAME WAS SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA
New bike day is when everybody gets new bikes !
10 MINUTES LATER :
Come on ! Everyone knows it .
RAINY DAY WOMEN
YES , REALLY .
The answer is simple , Dromiceiomimus !
Good morning ! Say , if you were sent from the future to observe me , you'd let me know , right ?
( " Norms " is what I call normal people , AND sets of guys named " Norm " . )
Oh yeah , mood is SO much better than facts .
Then why do I suddenly FEEL hungry , hmm ? Riddle me that !
In particular , I'd imagine one might determine whether or not society has collapsed without investing too much effort . Also : hail .
I have a pretty good knowledge of my closest friends . I know their likes and dislikes and can predict how they'd react in most situations !
Good times !
written by A DINOSAUR ! !
Audience participation ?
HEY !
Dromiceiomimus , act like me today , okay ? It'll be great . Examine what I'm doing and then try internalizing it , okay ?
Q . E
And there's Mrs . Tyrone , wandering aimlessly . I could stomp her too . . .
NO , IT'S PRONOUNCED THE SAME AS " QUEUE " .
Imagine . . .
With ice cream ?
I have come up with a game mod that will please everyone , even . . . THE DEVIL .
I can already see the headline : " The First Dude Murdered In Space ! "
is how I hacked the website to put pictures of me and my friends in the background ! Here is what's happening at Dating Site Headquarters right now : OH NO T - REX IS AN ULTRA HACKER ! ! ! BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT IN HACKING INTO THE KERNAL HE ALSO HACKED INTO . . . MY HEART < 3 < 3 < 3
Rex : IN CONCLUSION , my only disappointment with Breaking Bad is that it didn't end with Breaking Bad saying " I guess we really were . . . Breaking Bad " , THE END .
Aw geez ! I was thinking about what dogs are thinking when I said that and got confused ! !
I'm afraid you're making the # 1 mistake in predicting the future , T - Rex !
You shoot little ducks on the TV with your gun !
Manga ?
Okay , but the point of this card is that the recipient doesn't know the sender !
If you believe one person can imagine a universe , you have to believe they can imagine your thoughts too , and then you've got no reason to believe you're real !
I don't know , self ! I still kinda suspect that this sucks !
Remember that living to see tomorrow is not a guarantee / Better play some games on your home PC !
Where was Batman during all this ?
When I flush the toilet , it fills again with perfectly safe drinking water . We poop in water we could drink !
I still love you !
I am a dude with some SERIOUSLY UNINFORMED opinions about archaeology !
t - rex the more i think about this plan the less successful i think you're going to be
Quick ! To the hardware store !
LATER : INVITATIONS TO A " WHO CAN TELL THE BIGGEST REGRET WITHOUT RUINING IT FOR EVERYONE ELSE " PARTY :
Oh daaaaaang
Poor Al !
ALL ABOARD THE MAKEOUT EXPRESS ! YOUR TICKET IS MAKEOUTS . PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKETS READY .
Hah hah ! That's WAY more interesting ! !
He realized a generally - invisible fabric would have great applications in law enforcement : invisible nets and traps , for example , caught all but the most intelligent criminals . The fabric was also woven into ropes and used to construct beautiful " floating " bridges , stairs , and other architecture .
All I can say is : if the grain knows , it's not telling ! !
Why are we bringing back other dinosaurs ?
YEP , LET'S NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN
YOU smoke TOO ? ! I could stomp a house , I'm so shocked !
Yes ! Unbridled optimism appears to be the order of the day !
Well I was ! I said it out loud ! It was on the bus so it was embarrassing ! !
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY :
" Angola Maldives " . He's so cool !
What have I done with my life ? For serious ! I am getting older and if things keep up this way I will die an unremarkable dude .
Today is a good day I think for assuming that there's such thing as a soul !
YEAH DUDE IN THE BIBLE I'M LIKE " HEY DONKEY YOU CAN TALK NOW THANK ME LATER "
I disagree with you as well , my friend !
IT'S SO STRESSFUL
. . . Ethicists really worry about this situation ?
But you'd be challenged in the past by reincarnated agents of whoever liked future dystopia !
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DATE , my friend ! !
Are you writing this live ?
I know ! I was stoked !
But then how would he know when the light is actually on ?
Frig , maybe today's the day to play eighty billion games of solitaire instead !
I think you are overanalyzing this . People change , that is part of life . Just because we're in a state of gradual evolution doesn't mean we have no identity ; indeed , that identity is probably what's guiding the evolution .
He started looking up names based on other bad guys !
That depends on the learner , I guess !
I - okay ? Listen , how did you get into my k -
A : Unfortunately , yes .
Photos of butts in ( and on ! ) airplanes . I dunno , the future's rue sometimes ?
TEN YEARS LATER :
Aww , thank you T - Rex ! Are you coming out tonight ?
And what are iambic pentameters ? WHO KNOWS ? ? I looked 'em up and TURNS OUT , all it says is it's a phrase that means " having fiave iambs " . TERRIFIC . Then I looked up " iamb " and it said they're a metrical foot , so that's , what , 30 centimetres ?
LAH LAH LAH LAH LAH I can't hear you LAH LAH LAH what does God need with erotica anyway LAH LAH LAH LAH don't answer that LAH LAH LAH
THE STORY OF LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
Well , the same superpower every other vertebrate has .
Uh
Isn't that all you ever do anyway ?
Go ahead , Dromiceiomimus ! Ask me anything !
Why don't you do this ALL THE TIME ? I'd LOVE to talk to animals !
INPUT DISREGARDED : INFERIOR ROBOTIC MODEL
WHAT'S THE CUTEST PHRASE YOU CAN COME UP WITH ?
Uh , " Dang it " Superman said , fixing the buildings at super speed before they fell over all the way .
. . . dorable ?
SURE AM , sweetcheeks !
Ready or not , here I come !
How'd he survive ?
And you know how they'd paint an enemy kill count tally on the side ? Well she's got a bunch of cow silhouettes instead , and she's leaning against the wing eating a burger as big as her head .
truly , the best haiku ever . To Japan !
featuring t - rex : dinosaur , protagonist , erstwhile , smoocher
That's something we want to do ?
Do what ?
Aw dang it
You buyin' ? ?
Sources say , " Yep ! SURE CAN ! "
How come everything's so EXPENSIVE ?
I'm here to rap about things I like / This includes going for a ride on my bike ! !
zero zero zero zero zero
What do you actually DO in the game , though ? Do I take my car on nice country drives ? Give it drinks of gas and feed it nice oil treats ?
Did you just say that my SON is hot today ?
Friggin' adults , man !
I can assure you that my poetry is great , unlike our current department of state !
I'm fine .
It applies to all things !
Okay , it's settled . " Five essential moisturizing oils " means " call the friggin' cops , please ! "
HTTP error code jokes ? Seriously ?
Hells yes ! Hey , what's it like NOT having amazing maxed - out self - esteem ? BECAUSE I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYMORE .
Ho ho ! Good to see you too , D . !
For example : " LIFE IS A JOURNEY " !
Okay , so how many times on Star Trek have they gone back in time ? T - Rex : Depends on what you mean ! T - Rex : Are we including the movies - movies which , I MIGHT ADD , focus too heavily on attacks on Earth ? Utahraptor : Sure . T - Rex : Well ! I suppose THAT depends on whether or not we're including episodes featuring that competent Geordi fellow .
Wizards !
Not me !
THIRTY SECONDS LATER :
Just like Oliver Brackenbury ! !
Everyone ! EVERYONE ! I have made a startling discovery !
The brides are gone , T - Rex ! Remember when they ran down the church stairs while we showered confetti on them ? They've left for their honeymoon !
I am going to write an amazing play , and it will be hilarious and beautiful and meaningful and have depths that will keep critics writing for generations , and it will make me famous and rich .
Except that's been done ! I want something NEW that will touch the heart of everyone , WITHOUT EXCEPTION .
This is what I like !
I think I put too much symbolism into random encounters with people I meet on the street ! I see them as a microcosm for larger society .
It's alright !
She opened a business specializing in fun Hallowe'en portraits and cranked 'em out super quick ! The camera seemed to get angry , but that anger just made better corpse photos so Robyn was like - thanks ? Thanks , camera , your ghostly rage is super profitable so keep it up ? ?
Hello ! You've been fired from every job you ever had , unless you avoided it by quitting first !
UM I MEAN
The NEVER - STOP :
A sped - up landscape scene , with urban growth and decay happening in mere seconds !
You know what I'm sayin' , Utahraptor ? You pickin' up what I'm throwin' down ?
REGRET COMICS 2000
Okay MAYBE there were some downsides to the Columbian explosion . The old world got tomatoes and potatoes , AND corn and peanuts , AND rubber , AND cocoa , and in exchange gave the new world . . . lettuce ?
By which I take it you're nostalgic already ?
Suddenly , there's a giant asteroid directly ahead ! " Hard to port ! " orders the captain .
TIP : To find results from other timelines , use " reality : onewheresheneverleft " . You may encounter results where phrases like " cold " , " can't breathe " , or " I'm hungry I'M HUNGRY " are repeated madly , desperately .
For when it's an emergency situation ?
It's okay , I know how to do frauds ! !
What was the reason ?
T - REX YOU KNOW THOSE STORIES WHERE A PAUPER AND A PRINCE TRADE PLACES TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
Hey T - Rex , do you want to come with me today to the Lengthy Exhibit of Items of Exclusively Female Interest ?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE .
BETTER ANSWERS TO " HEY HOW ARE YOU ? " THAN " I'M FINE "
The Devil ! What are you doing here ? !
Like I'm surprised at how sucky a time traveler I am ?
T - REX IN : " THE WHITE LIE THAT SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL "
Smallpox !
I hope the Utahraptor is around here somewhere ! My legs are giving tired .
Noooooo
NEXT : EVERYBODY DIES ! : 0
LET'S ALL LEARN ABOUT CATS
" I'm serious , this song gets way better the more you listen to it " ?
Everything I'm saying is free verse !
Man , did you see what that Triceratops was wearing at the film last night ?
Still !
What the hell , this timeline ?
What the heck , Oxford English Dictionary ? !
RYAN ! HEY !
My people and I don't fit into your boxes , man
. . . but the next day the universe and everything in it starts to shrink ! !
. . . T - Rex ?
That you all for your interest in my driving class . This class will cost you $ 100 but you'll make it up in reduced insurance rates . Also , you won't be a terrible driver .
Steve was a man who liked his vampires like he liked his women :
Well shoot , why do they call it Jeopardy ? ? They should call it , " Brain Olympics " ! I'd watch EVERY DANG NIGHT ! !
I'm really thirsty you guys
hence my declaration of just a few seconds ago !
Yes indeed ! If I were the last man on Earth . . .
Sure can ! !
Aw , T - Rex ! I don't want to just tell you to buy me something .
Do you have a friendship crush on me , T - Rex ?
Soon I awoke , and there I was , veritably myself again . Now I do not know whether I was then a dinosaur dreaming I was a butterfly , or whether I am now a butterfly , dreaming I am a dinosaur !
Even in olden times , stories got terrible sequels ! This myth is ACTUAL FOLLOWUP to the famous " King Midas Messes Up His 'Everything I Touch Turns To Gold' Wish , And How " .
You vow to start making changes in your life , today . You can make the big decisions . You can make the small decisions . You are in control . Turn to panel 3 .
It didn't really make sense , because we were already her friends , for free . But we ran with it .
Talking about all my friends being dead has made me SAD
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
Change ! Like having cup - cakes instead of wedding cake ?
Utahraptor , the very mention of the name has filled me with UNSTOPPABLE RAGE ! I get that you're trying to revenge yourself on me for filling out your Utahraptore name change forms , but the difference was THAT name is awesome . Shortpants is what you call a dog that - that acts like a squirrel or something . And I'VE - Utahraptor ?
I believe you can change your name to whatever you want .
So let's say a miracle is something really special - a literal one in a million chance !
Oh shit
Serial number 47782 , baby !
TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION : easily disproved by taking any true story and add " . . . with naked sex aliens on top " to it . Is the truth still stranger ? No it is not .
. . . Not sure what else there is to say really , check yourself before you wreck yourself
So - dating ex - girlfriends ? I've heard this can be a bad idea , but I don't know . . .
And APPARENTLY , I'm not unarguably in the right when I say that " they " is always plural . FINE . Everyone makes mistakes ; I suppose it's fair that I'd FINALLY get my very first turn at bat . But that doesn't mean English is getting off scot free ! We still need an UNCONTENTIOUS gender - neutral pronoun .
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING PHYSICAL
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SURPRISE YOU
AND THEN I SAID
Hooray !
First , we'll need a torso !
I'm frustrated at my bank because they're all a bunch of sucker chumps ! What are you frustrated at ?
I have a secret ! The secret is that I absolutely ate potato chips last night instead of a real dinner .
That's a phrase , not a word .
Hey , I have a great idea ! I'll get a webpage , and then I'll put up all sorts of personal stuff about myself and my friends on it !
Can't wait , dude ! But in the meantime , I've the following demands :
These are both worthy competitors , but all will fall before MY entry !
T - Rex , you are the product of millions of years of evolution !
And why not ?
. . . WAIT FOR IT . . .
T - Rex , is this just a regular internet - enabled device combined with the facile observation that all emails , once sent , necessarily arrive in the future because they can't arrive in the past ?
What's wrong with that ?
So let's hear this free verse !
Utahraptor ! ! Utahraptor , guess what ?
Pfft . No , she hires a professional . and believe me . . .
The creativity that was required to create hoverbikes has been erased ! Who had the insight now ?
No good , unless it's followed by " also , we've found new places for everyone to live comfortably ; and hey , guess what : they're sweet new planets and we get there on starships , like from TV ! "
BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT WHAT DNA IS , duh .
If you are on a page with six different flashing " download now ! " buttons , I'm way good at knowing which one is the link to the actual file you want !
" Agreed , " said the other Batman , as they ran around beating up criminals like a couple of Rory Calhouns .
That really wasn't that helpful , T - Rex !
T - REX REACTION SHOT :
Oh frig ! I think the future just got awesome !
You know that Australia is really far away , right ? Super far ?
Hah ! Oh , Utahraptor .
Sure ! It's not a perfect measurement .
I was just wondering if it bothers you when I senselessly step on people .
Therefore , it's all downhill from here .
YOU WANT TO WRITE THE LITTLE PRINCE
But don't you see ? By casting marriage in terms of Game Boys , I make it seem accessible , fun , affordable , and sexy !
What will we do ? Someone will kill us soon to take our supplies and eat us probably !
a one - act play
Thesis statement : science fiction is a better genre of fiction than fantasy .
T - REX YOUR FANTASY LIFE IS FILLED WITH CONFLICT AND ALSO DISTURBING IMAGERY
So you'd never wish to have anything changed ?
I HAVE NO IDEA .
But put enough of us together and we'll start murdering each
" Stevella : A Story That Might Have A Sad Ending , By T - Rex . " Once upon a time there was a woman , Stevella , who knew EVERYTHING . Every single thing . " But that's impossible ! " you say . " How did she fit it all in her brain ? "
WELL OKAY HONESTLY IT'S ACTUALLY DEDICATED TO MY TRANSCRIBERS
You can call me . . .
IN THE FUTURE , portrayals by others of our shared past will infringe upon our memories of it , and people born after our time will only understand it through the shorthand aspects of cultural consensus found in the media .
T - REX REMEMBER THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO ENHANCE THE TIMELINE
Alternatively , Titanic's rudder was mounted behind her middle propeller , which was on a turbine not designed to work in reverse . When the iceberg was spotted and the first officer ordered both the hard - to - port turn and full reverse , this middle propeller simply stopped , greatly hampering the effectiveness of the rudder . Ordering the turn at speed would likely have saved the ship .
We know that , WORST CASE , Spider - Man will show up in the next issue and say " Hey did anyone miss me ? I thought I was dead , but then I remembered I wasn't ! " And yet we keep coming back for more !
You're pushed into the twitching pile of mangas , your feet and hands making contact with the gelatinous mass . They spiral up your limbs , and then you feel manga pushing past your lips . The mangas are moving inside you now . You can feel yourself ending . You - - YOU ARE THE MANGAS .
. . . Utahraptor is stands for " suck my hole " and if you think otherwise then SMH
HE COULD DECREASE THE SPACE BETWEEN HIS ATOMS , NOT REALLY POSSIBLE EITHER . IT JUST ISN'T .
Huh . I never thought of this before , but dreams are really fan fiction your mind writes itself , aren't they ?
Also that , yes .
Are we really having this conversation ? Because I'll have it . I will straight up discuss sex acts with you , T - Rex .
TWO WEEKS LATER . . .
So Professor Time " Time travels " ( which , again , is what she calls it every time she moves , but here luckily it DOES apply to moving through time as well ) to the future , where after she exits the " Time portal " ( what she calls doors after she uses them , but again , it applies in its other sense here too thankfully ) she explores mysteries of Time ( introspection , but she likes to go on walks while she does this so phew this too works in both senses ) .
The most famous racehorse of all time is Secretariat ! And that's kind of a rip - off , everyone . Race horses have ridiculous names !
A driver patron relationship is a very practical one .
WELL IN SOME PLACES PEOPLE DON'T REALLY USE REGULAR PHONES
They're & # 8212 ; energyless as well ?
Man , Dromiceiomimus has been looking fantastic lately ! I would DEFINITELY rate her current attractiveness as AT LEAST a nine point five on ten ! !
THIRD HAND :
These seem like something a woman could do equally as well , if not better !
i meant to write t - sex there but it won't let me change it
A FEW WEEKS LATER :
Wow , that's the least - plausible denial I've ever heard !
Yeah , it works especially well if you say it to your girlfriend .
Crawling sucks !
Good idea !
" Ten Hats To See Before You Die "
Are women not alive ?
Aw , darn it ! GROSS !
So if you agree the universe is a sphere , skip a page ! If you think it's another shape , keep reading .
I mean - it's okay if you like laws , or reading .
Popular music ! I just said . Popular music . Because in the 60s it was all , " everyone around the world , join hands " , but recently , it's all " people in the house , say 'wayoooh' " or whatever . We are singularly focused on rooms in houses and have forgotten the rest of the world ! Theory : incontestably proven ?
" I first encountered this aesthetic as a child and it is , therefore , object - ively cool and good "
bits .
Yeah , speed's fine if you want to be closer to things quickly , I GUESS .
I'M NOT A PEDOPHILE ! ! I am a LEDOPHILE , that is to say , an enthusiast of the tiny Indian village of Ledo !
He's not really your friend , T - Rex !
Well , they think he's so great he INSPIRED the super powers . He's actually just - really angry ?
That is a huge amount of time we kinda - wasted ?
Yeah , people say that
NO , I didn't . Maybe because I was too busy enjoying STARSHIP EXPLOSIONS ? Maybe I was too busy enjoying stories that feature the omnipresent threat of the HARSH VACUUM OF SPACE ? ?
If by " story " you mean " franchise " , anyway . I don't know . I think i've lost focus .
Therefore , inside pi is contained every discovery AND every work of art !
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
Oh snap , philosophers ! Did T - Rex just totally school you with statistically - based descriptivist approach to semantics ? IT APPEARS THAT HE TOTALLY DID ! ! It also appears he's speaking in the third person because he's so impressed with his awesome self !
. . . He was Born " Ready " ! !
T - Rex , all I'm saying is that i can be just as " manly " as I am now if I don't go " extreme baseball skydiving " with you .
. . . Okay , you know what ? I should've partied way harder in January .
AN IDEA WHICH LEADS TO DISASTER TWO WEEKS LATER :
It TOTALLY works ! I just thought that losing a job would be sad , but a poor little injured puppy losing its job ? That's heartbreaking !
Petey do you want to hold her hand and tell her how important she is to you ?
. . . lightning maybe ?
Egoism !
FINALLY :
What ? " We " ? You're more popular than me ? ! Since when ?
Whoah - historical BABES !
T - REX HAS A CAPE
Well , who are you talking about then , T - Rex ?
I like my women like I like my cars !
Today's historical chump is William H . Mumler ( born 1832 ) , who was a photographer guy who did portraits ! Only he wasn't very good photographer guy because one time he accidentally double - exposed some film , and the resulting image showed the one portrait clearly but also showed a ghostly image of the other portrait !
Well I'm going to be ABOVE - average , Dromiceiomimus , and I don't mean I'm going to think about sex two billion times per day ! Instead , I'm going to think really productive thoughts instead of sexy ones . Every time I start to think " sex " I'll instead think " How can I make things better ? How can I solve ALL the problems ? "
( I can't wait till he finds out I replaced his toothpaste with a COMPETING BRAND OF TOOTHPASTE ! )
Can the two Utahraptors be considered the same person ? Is the evil one just the result of some decision made differently ?
THESE ARE ALL TERRIBLE THERE IS NO WINNER
Whatever , man ! It WAS tall . It was also cold ! It was cold , and tall .
Hey , I just heard you bragging that your soup is , shall we say . . . QUITE GOOD ? ?
LATER , ON TINY - TOWNE ISLAND !
YES class we are ALL AWARE that we could've microwaved a pizza pocket already .
Hey , you know what's rad ? Old dudes not talking about how sexy they are .
You'd have little mittens attached with yarn through the sleeves so you don't lose them !
SONY is going to be stone cold sober the entire time .
Often we'll set up a ship or probe so they whip around the planets ( including Earth ) , getting a sweet speed boost as they do so ! This allows us to produce ultra - velocity spacecraft , effectively for free !
Just then T - Rex changed his name to " Luke Starwars " and then everyone wanted to buy his book now that it's called " Luke Starwars , Vampire Guy ! In This Story He Sees Some Sexy Bods " !
Thank you all for coming : I remind you this meeting is classified . " Rudolph " is an English - speaking reindeer who can fly .
So what ? You leave behind a bunch of stuff .
Anyway ! In conclusion , presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as I thought it was !
No , I feel I can do both .
SOLVE ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS COMICS
I throw my computer in the garbage and light the garbage on fire .
I don't know , but you'd better hope he likes it !
That would exclude all but the most cruel parodies of chocolates ! !
I still love all my ex - girlfriends , and remain good friends with them to this day .
TIME TO FALL IN LOVE , EVERYONE
I QUIT ; EVERYTHING IS HARD FOREVER
Later , I had sex ! Later still , I went back to the dentist .
So the story starts out the same , but the guy slips on some lube and then lands in an old jock strap !
" Most meteorOIDS break up inside atmosphere . It's only meteorITES that ever reach the ground , and the wast majority of those are no larger than a grain of rice . "

Be sure you are prepared for these responsibilities before choosing a human as a pet .
You did not just steal my pun , Utahraptor .
As near as I can figure it , the only logical explanation is that I love Batman SO MUCH that it made him real ! He's real now or at least his head is real now and he wants to hang out with me because I understand him like nobody else does . He's gonna teach me how to punch someone sneaking up behind me without even turning around .
Once upon a time there was a prince who still lived with his hoarder mom and who kept breaking up with his princess girlfriends for super trivial reasons . " Why can't I find a REAL princess ? " he sighed .
Argh ! People on the internet :
What amazing , novel and free - from - the - encumbrances - of - copyright characters !
Assuming they've removed the 5 - day waiting period on me changing my name , that is ! !
See , Dromiceiomimus , my new plan is to visit alternate universes to take back objects and ideas from them ! Hopefully that will be much easier than using godless science to violate the natural laws of time ?
That said . . .
How come these things always happen to you ?
Alright . T - Rex : not necessarily racist .
Continue reading when you're done being sad !
You mean " write A speech " ?
There ! Now with my Facebook deleted , I shall be remembered in legend instead of in depressing reality ! !
Yes ? ?
David Hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1892 . He built an infinite hotel , you guys !
It sounds awful but I believe it is the basis of our entire economic system ? ?
However , as he is basically a human dude , these poos would be virtually indistinguishable from a human dude's poops !
DUDE , I'm doing this . I'm staying up all night and sometimes into the early afternoon for some crazy 2pm parties ! !
So let us break that association by no longer contracting it !
And the sender of THIS card clearly thought the best way to tell you was to go home , boot up their computer , and email you a web card .
Oh my goodness do I ever love ELECTIONS .
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS
What do we use the diamonds for ?
It's nice to be loved
As I see it , yes !
T - Rex , it's most likely the oldest riddle on the planet . Without hyperbole , entire civilizations have risen and fallen since someone first came up with that riddle . IT predates PAPER .
New theory : Emotions ?
I'm serious ! This is a big concern for me !
Maybe , but who's going ? I don't want to go swimming if that guy from high school who made fun of me at the beach is there .
The hospitals aren't repairing him , friend : HE'S NOT GETTING HURT . He is a fallen god who has forgotten his true nature and whose exposure to mortals has made him chaotic , unpredictable . Everyone goes along and pretends he's a mortal too , hoping it will save them .
Time to talk more about my made - up country of Canada !
A British military officer's servant was called this , which originally meant " a man in charge of a horse and its load " .
That list is " stellar " , Rrad " , " peerless " , " prodigal " , and " done is such a way that it ruins me for other men " , in case you were wondering !
Looks like it's time for some . . .
I've got one thing to say , Dromiceiomimus ! Do you know what it is ?
Holy craps my house cold . My house so cold that I forgot to say " is " in both those sentences . That cold ! !
Hello Morris ! How are you today ?
Professor Science ! Can you introduce me to your friend , Professor Why Am I Suddenly So Nostalgic For Someone I Haven't Thought About In Years ? ?
Character development
Everyone is dead .
So there's a zombie apocalypse raging in the afterlife . The ghost world is overrun by ghostflesh - eating ghost - zombies .
YOU , I think , are surely my wackiest of friends ! What news ?
Do you know what someone who is fubsy is called ?
Last Thursday was a big day !
I'm not sure if that's offensive . I think it might be offensive ! Maybe ? I guess it depends on what food you think best represents " gay " .
Or an analogy . It's that thing where I compare two things to make you agree with me , you know ?
I wish I knew ! !
A FEW DAYS LATER , T - REX MEETS A ZOMBIE GHOST !
It is a great time to go out and watch fireworks and dragon shows and also eat dim sum until you explode . Did you know , Dromiceiomimus that Chinese New Year starts on the first day of the new year with a new moon ? So it's defined by both the sun AND the moon ! We're all like , ? hey guys , let's define our calendar based on the sun ? and the Chinese are all ? hey guys , I bet we could use the moon too to show THOSE guys ? , and they so did !
" The Power of Language "
So um , I just I found out that you can make a really good pasta sauce out of like , a can of crushed tomatoes and some spices . Maybe some garlic too .
Making the world a better place is important to me AND I don't eat it !
That was muchas delicious but did little to resolve the disparate issues raised by today's events !
I can and I will ! This is all in good fun , right ?
THIS IS NO JOKE
When movies were invented , people were super - excited ! For the first time , we could capture life , in real time , as it was happening .
That doesn't make it good though ! Lots of Christmas themed stuff is REALLY BAD .
Hey , remember when we had , like , jobs ?
Wait - just a few months ago you told me summer was your favourite season !
I'M GONNA STOP TALKING NOW AND RE - EVALUATE SOME DECISIONS OKAY
Hah ! Okay , it's a deal !
Even conversation ?
No , it had a Dickens ending ; STICK TO WHAT WE PRACTICED T - REX THIS IS SERIOUS .
I once read how to make bombs !
She's my fianc ? e from some other day !
Precisely , my friend . In three different ways .
Once upon a time there was an entity named " Eddie Grimlock Gabriella " who was born in a pile of hay . But after he was born he was taken away by a strange man ! The man locked him in a box and put the box in a truck . Then another man rescued him from the truck but put him up for sale ! ! Finally someone paid the ransom and rescued him and took him into their home .
Well ! I intend to find out , using the power of science coupled with the power of auto - experimentation !
Hello and welcome to I Am An Angry Person Who Doesn't Understand Why I'm Here
the SECRET to BEING LOVED !
But there's a rude side to me too ! It's who I am !
If I want to know for sure who I am , I have to find out if I'm the same person when I don't have all my memories . I need to contract amnesia !
Yup . Great movie it was .
WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL
You only get one vote , UTAHRAPTOR
OMG , I need to get a tattoo !
Where do babies come from ?
Excellent swimming , Sir ! More smelly food flakes ? ?
NOW YOU CAN SELL WHAT YOU BOUGHT ON EBAY
Open with " Hey there . Want to know more about ME ? " and if they say no say " Hah hah , no , seriously " and if they say no say " Okay whatever , you go first and talk about yourself and I'll listen . But you owe me ! "
It is ! I bet you're just trying to play " hard to get " . And , actually , by announcing that nobody can kiss you , you imply that they'd probably want to kiss you under normal circumstances . You're just spinning your cold , using it as good PR !
. . . Okay done .
You want to help these guys out ?
You've been dead for six thousand years !
It's a fun theory , but if you're absorbing particles all the time , shouldn't you be gaining mass ?
I can and do deny it !
Are you . . . definitely for it even when you're the victim ? ?
Secretly , neither would I ! High fives ! !
Utahraptor , I've got to go practice rocking out now , but can we talk about this tonight ?
Aw geez , I forgot how amazing mermaids are ! !
IF SO , is it creepy to then take it home ?
T - Rex , have you been to the library ?
And , you know , skills at poker !
COMPRESSED NOVEL COMICS
Sherlock wished to be good at solving crimes !
It's the coolest !
Hello , Dromiceiomimus !
You probably can't tell from over there but right not they're -
Used to fight the wolf ?
Please do ! !
HEY , WHY AM I HUNGRY ? I JUST ATE A FEW HOURS AGO . I HAD A CHICKEN SAMMICH . I THINK ?
Man , forget this ! I take back some of the things I said about civilization !
Good listener , though !
But maybe I know my new phrases must serve a world that hates and fears them , so they have to take baby steps towards acceptance . First it's " totally salty " , then " So Salt " , then , " SS , but not in like the Hitler sense " .
Buddhism 2 ALSO includes the startling revelation that Buddha had a daughter . Wow ! She's the slim and sexy new smilin' face of Buddhism , now in a tiny red bikini ! Would you like to know more ?
I would end up hating everyone !
I may be stuck like this for a while
. . . I'm going home to never do anything original again , okay ?
So , what , we restart and have to make friends with everyone all over again ?
And if you barter with a book , you're trading a story for something - literally !
This is just a regular detective story ! It's more Hardy Boys than Sherlock Holmes !
Now I just wait for the money to roll in !
Then I feasted on the death of lesser lives to sustain my own , and decades later , here we are !
THAT'S UM
ALSO THESE RULES WERE INVENTED BACK WHEN WE LITERALLY THOUGHT OWNING PEOPLE WAS RAD ; JUST SAYING ? ?
Come on . That's not a real law .
Dear audio diary ! You know what ?
If you like it when I'm wrong , then get ready to be SERIOUSLY SAD for the rest of your friggin' life ! !
This name is super dated though so eventually it's shortened to " The Ultimate Song " !
Dromiceiomimus ! How long have you been standing there ? !
Hey , I bet it works on men too !
But I found them !
" We are having sex righth now ! "
IT WILL WORK ON ALL MUSICIANS . Just you wait !
HUH
Aw man ! Making new slang : harder than I thought ?
Come on , any sufficiently - advanced ANYTHING will be indistinguishable from magic .
PERHAPS , but instead of " be careful what you wish for " wouldn't it be better to say " be careful what you eat , because atherosclerotic heart disease , the leading cause of death in the world , can be prevented through exercise , a healthy diet , and lower cholesterol levels " ? ?
Yeah , but you're treating the actual libraries ( plural ) as a symbol , which only confuses what actually happened historically . Certainly SOME ancient knowledge was lost , but I think it's disingenuous to suggest that its loss meant our development was set back thousands of years !
DIRTY LIES .
It would probably go down like this . Ask me if I want to go get a pizza !
It's true ! You travel back in time to the 1200s and you say " What color goes with St . Patrick ? " and they'll answer " blue " ! Eventually . First you'll need to figure out how to communicate with the people there : their vowels will sound all crazy to your ears . Plus , assuming you're in an English speaking part of the world - and there were a lot fewer of them then - the language was way more Germanic than what you're used to .
" The prince put down tar . " Do you even hear yourself ? You've drunk the Kool - Aid , man ! What's more likely : that MAGIC SLIPPERS that HAPPENED to survive midnight just HAPPENED to be left behind , or that we're being FED A LINE by people manipulating events all along ?
YOU WOULDN " T BE HAPPY IF IT READS " T - REX DIED THE WAY HE LIVED : ON IMPACT "
What about food ? I need that to live !
LATER , T - REX NOTICES HIS ORANGE JUICE IS SHIPPED STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON :
Maybe that wasn't clear . It's " How to bluff your way through every conversation about sports DAY . "
So you're implying that society serves a useful purpose , by encouraging me to be - nice ? Polite ?
'Cause it's a beanie cap with a glow - in - the - dark propeller on top ?
I will become rich and famous by becoming the world's best baker . My flagship product will be brilliant ! It will be rich , delicious , low - fat . . .
YES , good sir ! Who will lend me the money ? Someone AWESOME , perhaps ?
AT THE CIRCUS :
Congratulations ! You've expressed the one sentiment everyone on the internet eventually shares !
. . . Style . As in " bakery - style " buns !
can you tell people about me though
Wow , you must have a lot of stomping to do .
THANKS FOR THE LINK
Well it probably wouldn't have worked .
YOU MAKE OUT WITH TERROR .
Well , Justin Time goes by his middle name , Tehnikov , because having two Justins on the team would be confusing . Get it ?
Harry Potter's not a pussy !
ALWAYS
It's a little thing called ANTIHUMOUR ? A horse walks into a bar ! He causes a commotion and , terrified , tramples several patrons . Hah hah hah ! THEY DIED !
And MAYBE it's time to stop apologizing for it ! !
Suddenly James Moriarty appeared !
Motion : PASSED !
New Year's Resolutions are used to make changes in your life !
But without money people would still trade !
LATER , DISAPPOINTMENT :
A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF AN EMERGENCY :
Don't even , Utahraptor !
I have much to offer a potential mate ! I am big and strong and oh so sexy !
Boo on you , T - Rex !
Maybe it keeps happening !
Aw craps .
I buy my clothes off the rack .
T - REX AND THE DEVIL STAR IN : " ABANDONWARE ADVENTURES "
Um - " What's shake - a - lakin' , past dude ? "
Oui , je sais !
Aw man ! ! That's the end of me !
EARLIER THAT MORNING . . .
People should compliment me on my smokin' bod more often ! I WILL GLADLY DO THE SAME .
You know what they say : even a broken clock stuck at threesome o ? clock is right twice a day ! !
Neither of those are actual afflictions , T - Rex !
so I filled it with pictures from when we were kids !
Whoah ! This dog's got breasts !
I BRING YOU NUMEROUS GREETINGS T - REX
These are among the questions I have , yes
OR MAYBE I JUST DIDN'T PUT MANY JOKES IN THE BIBLE BECAUSE OF TRANSLATION ISSUES .
. . . sometimes I worry that I won't be enough .
Only they call those " straight flush " and " full house " instead . Even the names are dumber ! !
The winner is the person who guesses the closest number !
Damn right ! That's because we're all part of a cybernetic collective consciousness .
Okay , how do I reverse entropy ?
Dromiceiomimus , BE COOL ! Makeouts will come eventually , just -
See ? See ? That one only makes you sound like you're dumb and want gravy .
Alright ! Who here has some emotional problems they'd like solved once and for all ?
No , I'm sorry , you misunderstand .
FINE , my new book is called 1884 !
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH MY ANKLE .
And if we generously estimate 0 . 0001 chance of parent murder , then that's . . . !
Okay , but you're not deciding who you rescued , you're just choosing their gender identity .
Okay , but th -
That's pretty intriguing , isn't it ? What sort of history ? Did you used to date ? There's a lot I don't know about your history .
Yeah , any disease can have an idiopathic version , meaning for all intents and purposes that it arises spontaneously , with no detectable physical cause . All we can do is shrug and try to treat the symptoms !
All this and more is possible with alternative base systems !
Yeah . That sounds pretty satisfying .
T - Rex , remember yesterday ? You were totally right ! Fully and completely .
Not once have I been swept up in international jewel thief intrigue , nor have I EVER been followed around by eager gang members who think I'm their amnesiac and missing leader who's trying to go straight . Not even once !
BUT THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT NOW !
THIS CANNOT BE FORGIVEN , MAGGIE .
It would be SO GOOD ! You start out small : regular people , a fat guy at a buffet , building up to a parking lot full of cars tumbling into the sky , the star quarterback kicking the ball and then he , and everybody else in the game , flying up after it .
Well , I mean , not EXACTLY . Metaphorically . It was a good metaphor . By " exactly " , I meant to communicate " Utahraptor , that is an exact metaphor . "
Smoochitis is when you have a MEDICAL case of the smooches !
But after a person's accomplishments are listed , I put " They died anyway ! "
" DEDICATED TO CHUGGY G "
The dude freebases a 7 % solution of cocaine when he's bored ; he NEEDS mysteries to live . So why would he ever build a robot to solve them for him ? ?
From now on , I'll be sticking to things that WORK !
Nostalgia can make you sad .
Don't ask them anything !
AND NOW , THE CONCLUSION . . .
Fuuuuck
Hilarious !
Your formula is " Customers VERB1 what they VERB2 , but they VERB2 what they VERB1 " , for all transitive verbs , right ?
I think it makes you sound more dickish than wise !
FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE
That one is less impressive .
It's not me !
It's amazing !
I WAS JUST STARTING A CONVERSATION
Attention , mysterious voice from behind me !
Have you at least taken some medicine ?
THANKS , Burger King . I get it !
" Hush little matey / Don't you cry " . . .
. . . Sorry ?
Or the south pole , I'm not picky . But I want to be perfectly preserved in some cavern somewhere , so that when future generations stumble upon me , they'll say " Oh , gross . There's a dead guy in here . "
One time when you say it , you'll have to be right !
Looks like you've come down on the side of " gendered professional nouns have their occasional uses " !
It was raining real hard though , YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
And don't forget adding a few " . . . or so it appeared " s after your sentence too !
Who could've ever predicted that this would be what we'd get for living next to a SUN - SIZED THERMONUCLEAR REACTOR ? ?
STARING
Teens ! We have reasonable capacity laws on seafaring vessels for a reason !
I guarantee it !
Um . . . because they're horses !
WE JOIN T - REX AFTER THE EYE DOCTOR HAS TOLD HIM HE MIGHT NEED GLASSES :
Name - forgetting pride ?
T - Rex , are you looking to get beat up ?
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ACTUALLY USED " ALACK " LIKE THAT
Oh no , I didn't check in there . Hold on a second .
What ? How ?
" Oh , Lord our God / Be thou our guide / That by thy help / No foot may slide . "
Okay ! Honestly not really sure what I just said there !
I would describe him as " pretty frustrated "
So let's just multiply everyone's vote by their informedness !
One of the great myths of our time is that the trick to becoming good at something is to practice it over and over .
Congratulations , men ! If you followed all this advice , you now have a profile that will be very attractive to me , a heterosexual man ! !
" Or other identifying trait ! "
Come on , Wendy . The rest of us have problems here .
I will only start exclaiming again if I see something surprising .
15 YEARS LATER
You wanna smell , Dromiceiomimus ?
So what's the solution ?
And do I owe you anything , T - Rex ?
And what if someone wants you to be their valentine for real ?
There's a boxing kangaroo at the circus .
STARRING THOS . REX , ESQ .
A FAILED EXPERIMENT HAS CAUSED TIME TO BECOME UNGLUED !
I've got nothing against romance ! You can still be romantic while maintaining that love is an understandable emotion . Just be rational ! And don't do tons of stupid stuff and use " I was in love ! " as the justification . That's not love : that's responsibility deflection .
also always remember how i could beat superman in a fight .
I've never really been that into hips , T - Rex !
Don't even say it . I can't !
Food is just pals you eat !
An attempt to alter our perception of world history ? An oversight by later historians who never realized these years were fake ? WE SIMPLY CAN'T SAY . Time herself has been changed for reasons unknown - perhaps , UNKNOWABLE .
Spring break WOOO ! !
We're just a regular congress !
Ah oui ?
Thanks , T - Rex . That was a funny joke you shared .
I believe that to be Italian Canon , yes .
Dude , I gain the knowledge that if I die , the rest of the universe dies with me . Woo hoo !
DINOSAURS THAT TALK !
Denied !
But I'm looking for help , not for teasing .
It's unlikely my best breakfast will be so amazingly different enough from a regular breakfast that I'd notice it . That's sad , isn't it ? That in a lifetime of breakfasts , the best one should pass unnoticed ?
A new year is coming up . That means it is time to take stock of my life and make resolutions for improvements in the year to come !
I'm coming ! But only because I need a mallet too .
Real hard choice here I gotta say
Although the " actual baby " and the " imaginary baby used to justify expensive purchases " scenarios do both require me to be loaded enough to pay for 'em .
The whole thing is so surreal , don't you think ? The woman made a huge contribution to society just by getting sick . And imagine a new species EVOLVING from your body ?
I really don't like doing the dishes .
Guys , guys !
in this instalment : " JUST ASKING "
What's the worst that could happen ? !
A shrub .
AND WHAT I DO SURPASSES ALL MORTAL UNDERSTANDING
I challenge myself to watch fifty - two movies in fifty - two days !
I drank and drove tonight and I killed a man and last week I kinda date raped my date and I'm gay and I also am involved in a teen pregnancy !
T - REX GOPHERWOOD IS JUST WOOD THAT WAS PEED ON BY A GOPHER
Um , APPARENTLY , programming is for folks who are thrilled when a computer reminds them they're missing a bracket or semicolon ? It must be , because they make that happen SO OFTEN .
I - I just DON'T .
I would have thought you'd choose something closer to " And THAT'S why they call me the widowmaker " .
Listen . My joke is tremendously hilarious . It's a double joke , because 403 means " Forbidden " and there's a lock on the door . That is comedy right there . That is a one - way ticket to Laughtertowne , USA .
Oh P . S . ! He was house trained in reverse but could no longer operate a toilet ? ?
Who ? Who is it ?
I'd give up taste because smell is good to warn you of fires !
Future computers will unravel paradoxes with the same gentle skill they use in unraveling our hearts , and the only water to affect them will be the joyous falling of our tears as we weep in the face of their perfection .
This time for sure !
" I deduce we have slipped into an alternate universe ! " he said , detectively !
There's probably tons of other stuff that we've not only forgotten , but that we've also forgotten we've forgotten ! Maybe in the past it was all hoverboards and space helmets and cavemen saying " Hey , let's NOT write this down okay ? ? "
Did they have the groceries you wanted ?
Oh , that's easy then . You're coming on to me .
Stuck in a hospital waiting room ? Wish there was something that could make the time just FLY by ? ?
I was just talking about my favourite cross - cutting technique of all time . ALREADY .
How many Marios have quit part - way through because it's " too hard " or " got kinda boring " ? Some hero ! !
PRECISELY .
They have their signup dates and friend lists ; and one man in his time joins many networks , though of course Facebook is the best .
Another beautiful hot day ! I look forward to these " dog days " of summer .
I liked it up ti the tooting !
You're also simultaneously circulating blood throughout your body !
HEY MAN DON'T LOOK AT ME
Utahraptor . They're quite the whistles .
A FEW DAYS LATER :
Actually Shakespeare did write some pretty terrible stuff , T - Rex !
Travel was harder and took much longer !
. . . POST - COMMUNISM ?
I have a problem ! The problem is that when I'm chatting online with someone , I - I sometimes steal their writing styles ?
Anyway , wow , yay , go us
Will there be cake ?
Wow , Jimbo Wales !
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS LATER :
OF COURSE IT DOES I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M LAME
LATER :
SAY
T - Rex , it's me , T - Rex from the future ! Don't let Utahraptor read your comic because he's going to be a dick about it , okay ?
His exact words are " Is someone loving you ? " , which he follows with " I wonder where you are " .
So like , " Thou shalt not kill ? "
I think the idea is that zombies are undead ?
We should be halfway through by now ! !
. . . for PROFIT !
That's funny , because I don't seem to remember soliciting comments !
But in reality , " gluten " was one of the first GMO genes ever privatized . UN subsidies helped it to displace most organic wheat crops worldwide , so once people started developing allergies , it was far too late . Gluten - free foods are made from the few remaining " heritage " of non - GMO , strains .
LISTEN I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO START A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ACTUAL WOMAN
He ALSO stole form the rich and gave to the poor !
Yeah , but I wasn't then ! !
And you recognize the double standard here ?
T - REX DOES IT ANYWAY :
By failing to take even the SMALLEST STEP towards dictatorship , I've saved millions of lives that would otherwise be lots in the ensuing conflict . Wow , you guys ! That's a lot of peace !
Come on , God ! Would you rather battle Klingons on trolls ?
T - REX IS IT TIME FOR XMAS BREAKS AND ENTERS
UTAHRAPTOR I COULD HEAR IT AND I WASN'T EVEN IN THE SAME HOUSE AS THE SENDER OF THIS CARD
Yeah , but T - Rex , it's not a flattering story ! When people look at your lips they might start to think " mouse guts " instead , and then they won't want to kiss you anymore .
ULTIMATE OLD BADASS !
" If he worked as a chipmunk " ? ! Your wit seems a bit off today , my friend !
Important !
" YOU'RE WELCOME "
Legally !
Lunar women are good for stomping !
There's MORE ?
You know what ? FINE .
OH AND WITHOUT THROWING AN " F " INTO THE MIX TOO OF COURSE
NOW YOUR TURN
You're welcome !
But can one gather for the thrill of watching these fine specimens compete live ? ?
Still ! Impossible !
HEY GUYS HOW ABOUT SEX HUH PRETTY SEXY HEY I'M GONNA DIRECT THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS IT
Does she kill them herself ? !
Hey . It'll rule .
" Just "
Hey God ! You want my word ? Here it is !
Okay okay , so Ghost Dad says he died from too much poison and Hamlet's all " Record scratch ! Saw WHAAAAAT ? " then FOUR HOURS OF AUDIENCE TIME LATER , we've all learnt a valuable lesson !
What did you say ?
Makes sense to me !
" OKAY ! QUITTING SCIENCE FOREVER NOW "
And hey , don't forget !
Short answer : PRETTY AWESOME !
DEFINITELY NOT .
Utahraptor ! I'm gonna kiss you so much in ten minutes !
Comics are words or images juxtaposed in deliberate sequence !
Wait , you've given me a great idea ! Has that saying ever been applied to . . . PARTIES ?
OH WAIT THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF T - REX AND THE EARTH IS LONG SINCE DUST
The " Coso Artefact " wasn't found in a geode , T - Rex !
" Surprise ! "
Relationships are when you put two people in a jar , and then , you shake the jar !
You're so egotistical ! " I'm great at everything I've tried ! "
Man ! ! THIS is why I never get to gossip !
Yeah ! We went to the same school . He's the only guy I've ever felt that way about !
Nice chocolates for a nice lady !
But then - if Dromiceiomimus bids 98 cents , I'll bid 99 . Then she has to decide whether to bid $ 1 : if she doesn't , she loses 98 cents , but if she does , she'll break even . So she does , and I'm left with the choice of either losing my 99 cents , or of bidding $ 1 . 01 and then only losing 1 cent .
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOUR MOM YOU KILLED AN ENTIRE IMAGINARY PLANET FOR NO REASON
It turns out MY sister knows your friend's bride ! Small world !
Hey everyone ! Who here wishes their parents named them " Ironshoes Maneheart IV " ?
So most of movies consist of quiet , contemplative scenes of landscapes , with only background noises behind them ?
Hello Dromiceiomimus ! Do you want to go shopping for women's underwear ? We are after all both women !
DONATED MONEY TO AN ORGANIZATION TO HELP BUILD NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE OVERSEAS :

Oh , I don't know . . .
This means war !
Okay ! Now I'm late for the dentist !
Well ! I certainly hope I don't get prematurely invited to any PARTIES today !
Not from any SCHOOL !
Hmm . These crimes STILL sound pretty cool though . Is this a problem other crimes have ? ?
But - that dinner's tonight !
Consider jogging , friends !
YES . It is an amazing tale !
And I guess we DO measure the output of machines in terms of how many imaginary horses it'd take to beat them .
Anyway , author - um . . .
Then I guess - I guess to summarize here , we're all in favour of fall . We're all " down " with it .
But they also extended beyond art , to food ! Futurists had a MANIFESTO for food . It banned the knife and fork and pasta , AND told people that sardines and pineapples together were tasty times ! They banned pasta because it caused skepticism ?
In Conclusion , bananas are the best fruit ?
YET I WILL LIVE FOREVER / / HOW IRONIC
If I write good comedy , I know it's good because I laugh ! And good horror and erotica provoke a physical response too : scaredy emotions and / or PRIVATE TIMES , respectively . My body lets me know " Hey , this bit works . Good job . " by PHYSICALLY CHANGING STATE , which when you think about it , is basically amazing .
( You can use it if you want ! )
And then throw in a happy little girl with a bow in her hair to play with the puppies and the birds . Ooh ! And give her a bright blue balloon that's printed with the words , " Congratulations everyone , on curing all diseases ! "
I will imagine that this house is the box . My stomping of said box will symbolize my ability to effect change in my life .
Put it another way : If every decision creates zillions of alternate timelines , what are the odds that I'm in the # 1 best one ? ?
FOR ME
Yes , house - themed puns come courtesy of me , the Evil T - Rex !
NO , T - REX ISN'T CRAZY ! ! HE'S JUST USING THE PHRASE " NAMED AFTER ME " TO MEAN " THEY WERE GIVEN NAMED AFTER I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A NAME " ; THIS IS A 100 % VALID USE OF ENGLISH . the end .
She's my wife from another life !

DAHHHHH DAH DAH DAAAAAAAAH DAHHHHHH
BUT I CAUTION YOU
I'm not gratified !
Dromiceiomimus , this advice's Helpful Rating is currently at ZERO ! !
With Good Watson ! YES .
I know I know !

2 . 5 billion is really not that much !
Hilarious ! ! Plus , it offers some resistance to machine gun fire .
Well , I mean
Awesome ! I've never been to a wedding before , much less a lesbian wedding ! This is exciting !
IT'S BARELY EVEN AN EXAGGERATION
Now I'm all about " Do unto others AS they do unto you " . Notice the lack of a " would have " . Actually , NOW I'm all about " do unto others before they do unto you . " No wait ! " Do unto others at the same time as they are doing unto you " . That one is about doing things together with friends , I think !
WILL IS THE GAY ONE
T - Rex , I want you to meet my friend Gary . Gary , this is T - Rex .
I've got just the thing !
Maybe stomping this house will refresh your memory !
AND I can only use the scale 3 times to find out which ball is different !
See ? I don't even know who you are !
NO MAN I CHANGED MYSELF SO I CAN LIFT IT AND NOW I'M SO RIPPED THAT WHEN I FLEX MY SHIRT TEARS OPEN - THE REAL QUESTION IS CAN I MAKE A SHIRT SO TOUGH THAT MY NEW MUSCLES WON'T TEAR IT - PRETTY SURE THE ANSWER IS NOPE

We must duel . . . until one of us is dead . . . or both of us . . . are in love !

Spring is my favourite season , Dromiceiomimus . Do you know why ?
HOW DO THEY HEAR ABOUT YOUR SERVICES ?
THAT WAY , YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO FACTS ABOUT GIRAFFES
YES . He was Sherlock's nemesis in real life too .
Everyone knows that the 1920s were awesome ultimate fun times ( on account of flappers and swing music ! ) , and everyone knows that the 1970s were a decade of bad decision after bad decision : a cacophony of just - really bad decisions .
F - Fun !
MAN
She looks like a comely mate . I will impress here by my finesse and skill
And Utahraptor , you're suggesting that not all strong people are bullies ?
Not enough sexy Snapchats ? ?
He invented Mario !
They MOVED ? !
Darwin didn't invent evolution , he described it ! It existed before he came along . And he's not two hundred years old today , T - Rex ! His birthday was two hundred years ago , but he's dead .
Destruction is the natural response to such a metaphysical collapse !
I'VE GOT A PLAN : take an existing food , and add ketchup . Pour ketchup on nachos : that's a Sexy Rex , baby !
Casey moaned as Riley moved -
No , uh , what ?
Wouldn't it be great if people didn't need to be happy ?
My Sherlock Holmes Meets Sherlette Halmos fic can't compete with that .
I'm not telling ! That's why it's a SECRET .
I would not , T - Rex ! I would not . I'm not triflin' !
THE NEXT DAY :
GREGOR MACGREGOR COMICS
Oh , ha ha ! Don't worry about me !
I believe it's Mars and I think we should go there ?
Some of them build cars , T - Rex .
THIS CONCLUDES " COMICS FOR PARENTS TO GIVE TO TEENS " . PARENTS : BE SURE TO CUT OFF THIS LAST PANEL
Later that evening , he happily went home to his wife and children !
I'm an ambitious military officer , but it's hard to get noticed for a promotion !
Your question insults us both
All the major governments have published Food Guides , which do exactly what your Nutrinomicon purports to do : divide food into groups , and describe how much of each group is allowable for a balanced diet .
Any changes to dates are subject to availability .
DC Comics , quit hasslin' me ! Clarke and Louise and Bruce Swaine are my own characters !
That's okay , Morris ! Everyone gets confused sometimes !
Maybe soliciting a concussive blow to the head isn't the best idea I've ever had .
No presents , T - Rex ?
AAAAAHHHHHHHH
Sure it is ! Do you stay traditional and wrap presents nicely , in fancy paper - this can carry a lot of meaning - or try a more modern , environmentally - sensetive approach ?
" Screw you , dude ! Attention readers ! Only read the good sentences ! ! "
Then I will stomp on him like this !
It won't work !
I must guard against such self - absorption in the future !
That is like exactly my skill set over here how are you not including me in this
Yes , but -
I'm pretty sure you're the only one !
You grow inside an ant's body and take over its brain so you can move to the leaf you want . Then you consume its body for food , and THEN you force a stalk full of spores - your reproductive structure - to grow right out of the ant's head .
Hey , how's the writing coming ? Oh sorry , I forgot you're still messing around with PROTOWRITING .
What did the depressed snowman say to his dog ?
Hey , do crying pills really exist ?
Excuse me , sir ! Would you like to buy a button that reads " RETURN TO THE MOON AND DON'T FORGET THE CHICKS THIS TIME " ?
I have issues with physical intimacy !
If I change this cup : recyclable material !
Colour me impressed !
Hey T - Rex ! I know what's going to happen too !
I MADE IT
What are you planning - a documentary ?
While I freely concede that I PERSONALLY am indeed this generation's ultimate fighting machine , and that I can take you apart piece by piece and leave you in a big sloppy ol' pile for the garbage man to take away the next Wednesday , while SIMULTANEOUSLY cutting my nails and barely even noticing these events taking place , not every dinosaur is good in a fight ! You shouldn't assume we're all whirlwinds of destruction .
Utahraptor keeps money and FRIENDS separate ! My money and ME ( the friend ) , that is ! !
No , please ! Punish me some more ! !
Here are two cats . Do you want to purchase this jpg of two cats for $ 100 ? I will type 'yes' for you .

A few years after the Titanic sank he died from overdosing on ineffective syphilis medication .
Last night I dreamt I was preparing to buy a boat , and by " preparing to " I mean " stressing out about the confusing but necessary paperwork in order to " .
Indeed I have . Indeed I HAVE !
Wait . Do we know WHY the person reading this wants to handle 20 + G ?
It sure did , once I rewrote it extensively ! !
We can put a man on the moon , but we can't invent a dog that won't poop in my shoes ? We can put a man on the moon , but my cell phone still sucks a little ? ?
I've started a mailing list for TRUE fans of boats that sank !
God , I've been watching a pretty good TV show lately ! It's called " Scrubs " . It's pretty okay !
THAT'S NOT A WORD
- WELL , YOU'LL SEE
In the intervening 24 hours , I have done some research and found some UNSETTLING FACTS . Like the fact that most books that exist are fiction : I . E . , stories about fake peeps ! I thought this was just quantity over quality , but then discovered that most bestselling books are fiction too .
This just in , Utahraptor !
Why the hell did you favourite my tweet ? ?
How could I , when there'd be a trampoline at the bottom to ensure soft landings , AND stairs at the side for the elderly and the sissy - panted ?
" Have confidence in this certainty : things will be alright . "
Huh ! I guess SOMETIMES other people are funny too ?
Believe in yourself , and you can do anything !
Man , they say to write what you know , but I think they're just jealous of my awesome imagination !
Unfortunately the machines , with thousands of tiny gears and cogs , were too complex , beyond his means to fully manufacture at the time ( early 1800s ) .
Non - canon !
Depends on how it goes at the dentist , I think . I don't want to party with new fillings .
T - REX YOUR COMPANION IS CLEARLY UNFAMILIAR WITH MY PROWESS IN THE REALM OF MMORPGS
THAT , my friend , would be a pretty sweet cannon slash flash - light . Quick ! To Professor Science's house !
You're talking to yourself like you are two different people , and it is a societal norm that people who do that are insane .
Utahraptor ! Let's be serious !
A bunch of us were hanging out in a house , some went outside , and then a nuclear bomb was dropped in the distance and we could see a mushroom cloud in the sky . I ran to the door to close it and pressed up against it as the windows in the house blew inward and radioactive dust covered us all . THEN , after it was quier and we ventured outside , I ran into my friends who surved , but we all agreed we'd had too much radiation and wouldn't make it . It was really realistic !
It's the sea !
He's been to Pluto and back . . . and he's still 100 % teen ! !
I must stomp unceasingly or we are all surely doomed !
I believe it to be a MANUFACTURED HOLIDAY . Last year it brought me nothing but trouble , so this year I am going out of my way to make sure that everyone knows they don't have to celebrate their love if they don't want to !
FINE . You know what ?
Seriously , dude ! And normally people who are autotheistic don't really comment on the existence of other religions or gods , just themselves . It's kinda the old " the only consciousness I can be certain of is my own " argument , but , you know , applied to divinity .
I guess if they were a crazy racist , that would probably do it !
How ? Funny sweaters ? Funny evening gowns ? Funny HOSIERY ?
SUCKS
Now , Robyn's old - time ghosts refused to ride bicycles hooked up to generators , but before long she'd moved to France and rented houses belonging to deceased Tour de France champions , who took to the bicycles quite easily . And that , dear reader , is how our post - scarcity utopia was created .
So Tantalus was a Greek dude who threw a dinner party for the gods ! And he thought to himself , " I need to make sure this party goes off without a hitch . I'm going to serve the PERFECT MEAL "
Do you mean to imply that T - Rexes are not better than Utahraptors ?
Who wants to hear jokes about cats ? ! I sure hope -
Next time , I guess !
You can use " I lose at sex " for when you lose at sex .
That's a cool lady ! Hey , what's her naked body look like ? I should pay her less . I don't remember her name , but she looked like this :
I'm glad you decided to add time machines to your plays , Shakespeare !
There are many facts about dogs ! Here are but a few of them .
WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD , T - REX ! WE BROUGHT YOU SOME PUDDING
PROBLEM 1 : NOT ENOUGH SALT
It's in the book !
You'd rather she marry - well , who , Jughead ?
Okay , I can still pull this out . Watch and learn , Utahraptor !
Wow , when did you become an old man , T - Rex ?
* DromiceiomimusandIaregoingonaroadtrip *
Dromiceiomimus , ask me how many cells an average adult dinosaur has making up their body .
So : " Probably not ! "
I KNOW !
it would be great if one day i rode in a hot air balloon and threw down candy at people so they liked me more .
Helium's so light that once it's in the atmosphere , it actually ends up escaping into space . We get new helium by mining it out of natural gas reserves , but those are decidedly finite !

If you don't wear socks then you've ALREADY levelled up to ultimate convenience .
What's a " panel " ?
Like this :
That's what the other characters say to the first character . Then they get into a fight . The fight spreads , and before long the audience is drawn into it too !
Ummmm , I can hear my SCIENCE TEXTBOOK telling me about AUDIBLE HALLUCINATIONS and how they AREN'T REAL ?
And what do vampires do like ALL THE TIME ? ?
here he comes !
Cheerfully conceded !
a ( n )
Man , when are we gonna do that ?
Yes ! Zombies are too effective to be contagious . That's why they can't exist in real life !
I can also pee standing up !
In fact , yes , we will talk ! I'll be the one saying " oh my gosh oh my gosh SO CUTE " !
But it was sexy , right ?
THE PERFECT CAT
that way you won't be disappointed
Man , you know what ? It's WINDOWS for WORKGROUPS . The last person to actually use this software died in like 1855 .
BUT SOON :
Yes , but it's not rational to assume that's the case .
What do you mean by that ? Will the planet explode or disappear or whatever ? That seems pretty unlikely
Cat and riddle time is OVER ; this is an actual life challenge I must wrestle with
I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS T - REX I WAS WRONG AND THE BIG RIP DIDN'T HAPPEN
IS THE WORLD DOOMED ?
I do that anyway ; you know that !
Actually , " Chicago " is a corruption of a local word , " shikaakwa " , for wild onion .
And we need it ?
COMICS WITH EMBEDDED FASHION ADVICE
The Beatles spent SO MUCH TIME worried about who loves whom ( SPOILER : turns out she loves you , yeah yeah yeah ) but that helps nobody ! If they'd sung more songs about things that matter ( and YES compiler errors beat feelings here ) who knows where we'd be ?
wHHHOOOOoooo
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAY " BOO " PEOPLE GET TOTALLY SPOOKED
It is a work in progress !
History does not record , unfortunately , what must have been a stellar retort on the part of T - Rex . Of this , however , we can be certain : he was an awesome dude . One is advised to tell one's friends !
Ah , I get it . You're writing a story where all Watsons are actually the same immortal being .
You need to stop playing so many video games .
the COMIC
" There are over 100 different species of pine trees " , he read . " But scientists have discovered that really there's just three main kinds . One thing all pine trees have in common is that they don't lose their leaves during winter ! That makes them very special trees . We call them 'evergreen' . "
Man , it's cold out ! I wish it were warmer outside !
You know the trope in cartoons where there's a " help wanted " sign , and the unemployed hero will go into the store and take the sign down , because he's SO SURE he'll get the job ?
Good luck working things out , you crazy kids ! !
Luckily , I still have Method # 4 , which is to set unreasonably low expectations for everyone , including yourself .
PET FOOD
I've got two words for you !
Anyway , I'd better get on with my day !
" Oh , GOSH ! "
T - Rex , your Twitter bio just says " Sexy in that trashy way . You know what I'm talking about . Yeah you do . You know . Shut up , you do . "
You know who never forgets ?
Maybe I'm not BAD at idiom , dude ! Maybe I'm GREAT at it . MAYBE rather than parroting old phrases , I push them in new directions , boldly evolving them into newer , greater forms . Maybe I'm the greatest linguistic mind of our generation , and maybe that's TOTALLY SALTY .
Walk it off , democracy lovers !
Paleontology Phunnies Dept . Once in a long while we come across a comic strip that is so mind - bogglingly bad , we can't help but wonder why it isn't already extinct ! It's time for a MAD look at . . . DINOSNORE COMICS

CHILLAXING
I want emails !
Once upon a time there was a tiny ghost : he'd been a full - sized dude when he was alive but when he came back as a ghost , he got all tiny ! !
I'm just left with an acute awareness that I could be wrong about some of the things I currently believe in . Not big things , like racism , but little things , like mohawks !
No I'm not ! It's just that dreams always sound really symbolic when they're described , that's all !
Maybe I should just accept that I'll never be on the cover of a magazine !
Let's say you've dropped your toast on the floor . Pick it up , my friend ! This is just one of many . . .
ANYWAY I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK ; THE DATE IS ONGOING
What'd he say ?
Sure , but also impossibly expensive and difficult . I appreciate it , but I'd rather just have some hangouts !
Don't even joke about that , Utahraptor ! I rely on my sense of humour as a social lubricant ! It's the secret to how come girls want to kiss me sometimes .
I . . . forkgot not to ? ?
Now what you hear are Earth's first words : I'm talking with my cace ! Yeah , no - one else can speak right now , but I'm ready just in case !
Because it rules ?
Ha ha , nope ! Maybe this will let US get a word in edgewise !
I got this , I got this !
No , but Carl Sagan did .
Shhh ! THEY'RE ABOUT TO KISS
If you're bitten by a zombie then you become a zombie , so all the vampires would eventually be vampire zombies !
Yes it does , T - Rex !
Well , let's just say that a lime green t - shirt coupled with electric blue shorts is not exactly the most stylish of outfits .
But that's what slot machines do , and people LINE UP to play them ! OH SNAP ! IS THIS ANOTHER ARGUMENT WON BY T - REX ? ?
So now you're a woman ?
Today I am going to plagiarize out - of - copyright books ! And I choose . . .
Now listen up , Comptroller Whiskers ! With my first taste of mayoral power I intend to enact many sweeping reforms . I trust you will support my radical agenda ?
ZERO . They claimed they couldn't !
well . . .

I didn't know the factual part of that , no
HEY , WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH THE EGGS IN THE SECOND PANEL ? OH WELL
Eventually a camper makes it to the opposite side , at which point they get twice as fat and can now hop backwards . I don't know why . This continues until all campers from one side have been eliminated .

It's going to be great ! This is the best idea ev -
In the future , we'll all have one cyborg eye paired with one normal eye for dramatic contrast ! We'll have one more thing too :
It appears that there is some aspect of myself that craves a meaning - any meaning - to my actions .
Yes , the woooorld , she revolves around me ! ( Probably ! )
i think it's like - discolouring my skin
We tend to think that history is just a record of what goes on in the past , but this overlooks the fact that two different people can view the same event , and even the same series of events , differently .
You are one of five lucky children selected to tryout new ice cream flavours . Do you try " Hugsberry Lime " or " Pulp and Paper " ?
Wow , you hate people who appreciate culture but who can't afford expensive artifacts ?
When multinationals do well , I usually feel like that's bad news for me .
I was just babysitting my adult neighbor . But then I realized : wait , you don't babysit adults ! You only babysit CHILDREN !
Man , that was ME you slapped in the face , T - Rex !
Then good news , T - Rex ! You're already a cyborg : that tech's called LANGUAGE .
I dreamed last night that I was sleeping in av ery tiny car .
I'll always love you !
I got it when I fell rocket skating after hang - gliding off a mountain and landing in waiting rocket skates ! I hit a bump after a few kilometers .
Why don't they make some sort of confirmation whenever we want to reply to all so we don't end up doing it by mistake ? Only that would be irritating , so maybe - well , I'm not sure what the solution is . But it sure is funny when we accidentally reply to all , in a " well , maybe it will be funny 20 years down the road " sort of way !
* phew *
Well ! Then it's settled !
This unstoppable warrior race says they'll use our impure blood to water their crops , and if we kill them , more warriors will arise OUT OF THE VERY GROUND ITSELF .

Hah ! What ?
Yeah , whenever I imagine a world so much better than ours , yet so clearly impossible ! Reality doesn't measure up .

If I can tear the planet apart , there's got to be easier ways to get a tiny woman off my couch ! THAT'S RIGHT TINY WOMAN , I NOTICED YOU HANGING OUT ON MY COUCH ; IT WEIRDED ME OUT AND I STARTED DOING MATH
HAH HAH THAT'S ADORABLE
That was fast
Too eager ?
Dromiceiomimus ! I'm turned on by scrambled eggs spontaneously climbing back into the shell !
YOU MIGHT EVENTUALLY LIVE THERE , T - REX
Sure have , God !
Besides , honesty can help the dumped person improve . They can say " maybe my sassiness IS at all - time highs ! ! " instead of saying " GEEZ I wish whoever controlled our fates would stop being such a DICK " , saying " DICK " really loudly so the fate controlling entity is sure to hear .
Every day , dude .
THE WISHES WEAR OFF IN THREE SECONDS !
So here's how you get started on Tumblr !
AND WHO IS GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW TO A WONDERFUL WOMAN NAMED SONJA AND T - REX YOU ARE THE BEST MAN
Every YouTube comment ever written is part of your project too .
Okay in this story I'm a computer called Multivac !
No it's not fine .
" Look out humanity ! For I embody . . . um . . .
. . . Before I said it out loud , OBVIOUSLY .
. . . Maybe something super modern like - posting to Twitter ? I guess ?
It's mandatory ! ! ?
It's a play about BATMAN ! I'll play Batman !
With these insanely long copyright laws , there is no new public domain , and our modern culture is owned and put in private hands ! It ensures you can't build on anything that's been created in the past 70 years .
Really ? What other characters do you have ?
YES , I WAS .
I've got CHARACTERS but no spark . They're not falling in love with each other ! They're staring at each other across open plains in the sunset , but when they finally meet up they shake hands cordially . THEN , after a lengthy silence , they inquire about the weather . How do people friggin' fall in love ! ?
Do you ever wonder what things'd be like if Dromiceiomimus were a heterosexual dude instead of a heterosexual lady ? I know I have . And I think it'd go
I have come up with the best science fiction story idea ever !
You are fundamentally misunderstanding the principles at play here .
. . . Okay , listen , maybe they'd smell them ONCE .
I don't know why he thought we'd want to watch him poop .
Niiiice .
T - Rex Awesomebux ? I've got lots of those !
You forgot to wear your stupid cape , T - Rex !
A little , I guess ! If we're ranking dudes , dude with good intentions IS higher than dude without any intentions .
He died from the experience , but came back as a ghost . He was a PRETTY cool ghost . If he saw you with a hat though , he would punch you right in your flippin' neck . He would sneak up behind you and whisper " There are some ghost who don't punch people in the neck . " and then the last thing you would see before you were punched were the ghostly words written on his fists : " I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GHOST " .
I just wish it'd cried less . I'm sure if the baby and I got to know each other , we could be friends !
Are you serious , T - Rex ? Because I'd love to go , but it's super expensive : cruises cost like 10 thousand dollars , plus there's the effects tourism can have on a place , distorting local culture and in some cases the original beauty that first drew people ther -
It was a DREAM I had . Just cause I dreamed it doesn't mean I believe it !
A bush .
Well , thanks T - Rex , but I already have a job ! Also I don't wanna hug people for money .
" Old and undesirable bachelor " ?
What gets me every time is the faces of people I'll never meet , people long dead , trying not to move as they stare into that early camera lens . . . but what ESPECIALLY always gets me are the faces of the people who did move . This was for some the only time their face would be recorded , and they happened to shift .
It - what ?
He was the biggest jerk ! Do you remember when I asked him if I could borrow his pencil sharpener , and he said " no " and then hid it from me ? He jerked up that relationship but good !
you just need to be drawn by someone with talent
I realize I can't move or breathe since muscle control is electrical so I suffocate , but it's no big deal since my brain is also electrical so I'M ALREADY DEAD . Everyone's INSTA - DEAD , yo . Thanks T - Rex !
Good ! Good .
I feel like I'd prefer to give my money to charity directly , rather than go through this whole " creepy date " thing .
However !
Woo ! Hallowe'en ! I love Hallowe'en because I love dressing up .
Nooooooooo !
Honestly ! I just want to hear the truth !
No . No , it's nothing like that . It's actual bottled inspiration ! I came up with it when I chemically and accidentally created just a little inspiration , and when I drank that , I was inspired to create more ! There's a whole pool full of it back at my house . You can drown in it .
Eventually your talking dog will be old enough to buy you presents , mow the lawn , and pay for its own food . If you're lucky , it'll even take care of you in your old age . Aww !

Movies . . . are actually written by many people ?
Wait . But I'm not sure what happened ! You never actually told the story !
Maybe it is though ! !
Don't be so negative ! This is EXCELLENT ADVICE .
Hmm !
Okay ! Utahraptor , you know those " # 1 Dad " mugs ? They make thousands of those . You can buy them in bulk .
there was a little girl in a red HOODED SPACESUIT who was sent to go visit her GRANDROID , which is a GRANDMOTHER ANDROID . But oh no , what's this ?
What if that second thought doesn't come though ?
It's time to live this day . . . TO THE MAX !
I filled too many holes
First off , dressing up as a member of a RACE for Hallowe'en is insanely racist . Second of all , you don't have the skill necessary to pull it off !
Still just ask him about science stuff though , okay ?
today's democgaphic :
Hah hah hah ! ?
I understand that many hands make light work . But what about the opportunity cost to me ? I am an EDUCATED GENTLEMAN who could otherwise be out making the world a better place ! But instead , what am I doing ?
I just wanted to say that I will always treasure the short time we spent together , and I hope that in time you will understand how I feel .
We have this " Mother Nature " metaphor that we all share but rarely consider critically , and it has all these connotations that are sublimated into our lives and thinking ! It suggests the planet tries to care for us as a mother would , sure , but it also suggests that plants and animals are provided by this mother with the intent of our nourishment , and that nature can carry parental authority !
[ in Back to the Future font ] TO BE CONTINUED
Just to keep the friendship interesting , you understand .
This morning I skipped breakfast and met T - Rex for lunch . He seemed excited . He always seems excited .
Meanwhile , FAIRIES have been able to fly since forever and they do so under their own power . Have they shared any heavier - than - air flight skills with us ? NO THEY HAVE NOT .
SALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THE SIZE OF HER MERITOCRACY
Pretty sweet indeed , my friends ! Pretty sweet indeed !
I got one that was like " I am really sad : ( ( ( ( ( ( " and it's sort of a bizarre emphasis that entirely divorces a smily from its own visual iconography . I'm not sure how I fell about that .
. . . was a tiny elephant friend named Mr . Tusks !
Natural disasters ?
Yep ! I'll miss you , Dromiceiomimus . I hope this trip brings you nothing but happy memorable occurrences , and unexpected , but welcomed , smooches .
See THAT'S what I keep telling everyone !
They support the entire food chain !
ANSWER : The Arabian horse ?
You need to go to school for all those things . All you ever do is stomp .
Yeah , actually that's somehting I'm not very clear on . Are we dating ?
So I email different names to tons of different people , knowing that there'll be ONE groups that gets the correct winner , showing them that I apparently have FUTURE HORSE KNOWLEDGE . I then repeat the process on the winners over and over , until I've got a small group that's seen me be right EVERY SINGLE TIME . Then I say " enough freebies , you gotta pay me now " and have become a scam artiste !
Well , has anyone else gotten messages like this ? Maybe the guy really just dislikes you !
T - REX TELL ME A SPIDER - MAN STORY
" He kinda wanted to find out ? "
I know , and it already sounds great ! !
THAT I NOW PROPOSE SHARING WITH YOU
GREETINGS T - REX LET'S REMAKE SOME CLASSIC VIDEO GAMES
THAT WAS SO IMPROBABLY FAST !
OBJECTIVISM COMICS
I like the white !
Sure . Sign up to serve with Petty Officer Why Are We Giving Our Opinions Stupid Military Ranks Anyway .
Say you think I should go on a trip around the world , while I assure you that I can't afford it and that I should stay home . From that , we would conclude that I should go on a trip exactly half - way around the world , where I'd probably run out of money and get stuck !
I saw the greatest TV show last night . It ruled !
NO WE'RE NO DOING THAT
Knock knock , a visitor has arrived !
I - I don't know why .
Anyway , that's exactly what I intend to do today . Kindness ahoy !
THE WORLD OF TOMORROW ! !
Does it really matter which idiolect you use ?
i know that it's green
What ? ! Who is this ?
SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE IS LIKE I DON'T KNOW GHOSTS OR DRACULAS OR HAUNTED CHAIRS
As a man who has read SEVERAL books , I am fully qualified to give you
FINALLY
Wow . That's sad , isn't it ? As adults , our futures become smaller and smaller each day .
Fine ! I'll invest my stupid $ 50 in the stock market . Okay ? HAPPY ? I'll invest my $ 50 in a company that makes NECKTIES FOR UNDERACHIEVING DOGS .
Okay so in this new religion you should be nice to each other because that's nice . And you can do whatever you want as long as there is informed consent between all parties involved . And everyone gets bikes . I will say that if you join my religion then you get a new bike .
HEY T - REX THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY ASKS YOU FOR ID YOU SHOULD PULL DOWN YOUR PANTS AND SAY THIS IS ALL THE ID I NEED
Hmm . That - that's true .
It's so obvious ! I'm going to learn how to throw knives at a distance such that they can cut speaker wires !
Yes , well - that's over now !
Wait ! WAIT .
I dedicate my life to working tirelessly for the grater good , and I never know if I'm making progress . I dedicate my life to kicking an evil kangaroo two thousand times , and with every kick I can say " Hey ! PROGRESS . "
Google is like a friend who remembers that one time
" Jennipoos " ?
And for those of you tempted to say that true strength isn't JUST a matter of having big ol' muscles , I must remind you that this is the sort of thing the non - strong whisper to each other as they huddle , quivering , under a frond . Meanwhile the strong are walking by , and yeah they're quivering too , but only because they're so excited by their big muscles !
. . . SUPERMAN'S BIRTHDAY ? ?
I'm not afraid to say there's tons of downsides !
Then I tried to cheer myself up by thinking how much of EVERYTHING people from history times missed out on , but then I realized all the FUTURE AWESOME STUFF that I'm never going get to see ! ! And now I'm sad forever !
MAYBE
WARGAMES
We're surrounded by living creatures that EAT SUN .
That was awkward !
But you don't need kids of your own to spend a lot of time thinking of how to reduce children to abject terror .
Hello ? I play by my own rules . Rule number one : no going to class , baby !
Do tell !
IT . SOUNDS . AWESOME .
Although , I MIGHT change the lyrics to " Hey there guys / You know what would be great ? / If this guy / would cardiopulmonarily resuscitate "
What book ?
You're seriously saying that specific writing techniques can reliably induce a physiological reaction .
But M - W will obviously choose words in the dictionary !
I'll kick his ass !
I really thought it was actually !
Time for some more epitaphs , bitches !
So you covered over 4 billion years in 31 words , that's about . . . 7 . 5 words per billion years ? Which leaves about two words to sum up our entire recorded history .
Well , um , what's your platform ? What issues are you concerned about ?
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO KNOCK ?
Prohibition ? Why prohi -
A SPOOKY TALE
YES . YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SAY " DO YOU HAVE ANY SEXY FRIENDS , BEYOND ME , THAT IS " AND THEN DATE WHOEVER THEY COME UP WITH
Pretty great , I know !
Stop it !
And atoms are NATURE'S pixels ! You just proved my case for me ! Awesome !
And wow , is there a Twitter machine around here ? Because that's something I'd love to " re - tweet " ! !
But then it got stuck in ice , so its crew abandoned it , and then two days later it got unstuck , so its crew unabandoned it . Then it got stuck in ice AGAIN , and this time most of the crew was rescued by helicopter . But some stayed , living in a hut they built for warmth ! Then a huge blizzard struck a few weeks later , and when it cleared -
They're a utopian society , right ? But the term " utopia " is a neo - logistic pun in Greek ! There , depending on how the word is pronounced ( " eu " or " ou " ) , it means EITHER 'good place' OR 'no place' . In English the " u " handles both these sounds , so 'utopia' actually contains both of these meanings !
Look out behind you ! !
SURE ! Also , I -
See , no . " I'ma gonna " just makes you sound like Luigi . Also I saw it on the INTERNET , so if I knew how to snap right now I'd say " Oh " and then snap so the resulting message is " Oh snap ! ! "
NOT A PROBLEM ! !
JUST
Petey do you want to create the deepest interpersonal connection you've ever experienced with her ?
Tell me honestly , Mr . Tusks : do you think my grave pranks are DEFINITELY the most awesome ideas you've ever heard ?
Easy ! I'll just remember to send a message back to this exact moment !
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING T - REX I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU RUINED DUE TO HILARIOUSLY SUCKY POKER PLAYING
If you have way more DELICIOUS CEREAL , turn to panel 2 !
I think that's the whole point .
I really need to think long and hard about my life decisions .
I GUESS I HAD A GOOD TIME LAST NIGHT even though we didn't have sex
AS SHOULD WE ALL .
When I was in high school , I'd increase the font size on all my periods from 12 points to 14 points , thereby extending my paper in a way that was very difficult to detect !
Hah , whoops ! MY MISTAKE !
Hey T ! Did you hear that I'm going to be working at a golf club this summer ?
WELL IN SOME CULTURES TATTOOS ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND MEAN MORE THAN JUST " HEY GUYS SO LOOK I HAD SOME EXTRA MONEY "
NON - CANNON
Did you know that mass extinctions happen REGULARLY in our past ? Like , every 27 million years or so , a bunch of life on Earth just DIES . This is not a joke . This actually happens .
So what's the symbolism there ? Is it called " The Life Machine " or something ?
It was like he was walking down the street rapping to himself , and just happened to stop outside my place when his flow got going . I can respect that ! I kinda want to be that guy , you know ?
Too often we support something just because it's new , and forget that if an idea or process been around for a long time , that's usually - but not always , granted - because it has something to offer .
Neither the past nor the future actually exists !
Haha , no , it was a little thing called " write what you know " and ALL I KNOW is endless trains of thought that involve superheroes .
But that's not important right now !
Yeah , but that's because " firefighter " is way more awesome ! Words that have " fight " in them are awesome .
Somehow it got even more moronic !
HORSES , Geordi ? Seriously ?
Spring is nice !
There were hot dates AND weddings AND makeouts ! And tiny elephants and tiny bugs and long before that some racooncephalopods and I think a talking bottle of vanilla extract was in there somewhere and the craziest thing was , everyone called me " T - Rex " ! Isn't that crazy ?
And this one is easy because we all know the perfect dog comes when called , is adorable , likes to snuggle and never poops .
ENDING ONE
That was - actually a really good answer !
AS PUNISHMENT I'M AFRAID I WILL NO LONGER TALK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES WITH YOU SO THAT YOU MIGHT LEARN YOUR LESSON
What if you made your house spiritually scary , T - Rex ? Like , instead of a corpse , a mannequin of a woman who is realizing that she has married badly .
Thanks , I made it up myself !
And we've all been spammed , am I right ? It would be great if spammers found something else to do !
It's safe to eat chalk , right ? Probably ?
It is a FACT that one plus one equals two !
Can I come over and -
WOW ME
Gentlemen , ladies : calm down please ! It was me ! !
Aw man , that guy's a rube !
Are these friends . . . dogs ?
Probably !
Um , I'm TRYING
Surveys get people with opinions , and the bored , and the lonely . But not the apathetic and the jerkasses ! You know what jerkasses do when some stranger calls up and asks them questions ?
Day
I heard you were making racist jokes ? !
Who wants 15 % of a puppy ?
She finally put her phone away , but then took it out a few seconds later . " You getting texts ? " Angola asked , but Tunisia only stared at her phone for several seconds before saying " Sorry , what ? " . Angola wondered who she was texting .
My house is like the ice planet Hoth , in that my house is a ridiculous planet with only one climactic zone on it , and that zone is " CHILLYTIMES " .
Hey , are we writing " thanks for the sex " cards ?
But there are also times when you see that as the terrible tragedy of our times , right ? Times when you'd wish nothing more than to build my game , so you could control the gross burnt - up fire hands of which I've dared to dream ? ?
Well crap
It's a difficult situation for everyone involved to be in !
Whoah , Utahraptor ! I thought that DROMICEIOMIMUS was behind me !
You'd like to see someone , but then again , it doesn't mean they mean that much to you ?
I DESIGNED YOU TO EAT MEAT SO UM
What if I put chocolate sauce in my iced tea ?
Um , it's just a box kept at the bank that only I can access , IN A PRIVATE ROOM , and whose contents are kept secret EVEN FROM THE BANK ITSELF ! That's awesome . That may well be the ceiling on how awesome it's possible for a box to be . Plus , you can put secrets in it !
LATER : T - REX FAILS TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS ON HIS RESUME PROJECT
You don't think permanent lights are less special ?
" In this universe , Shakespeare only wrote R + J sequels , whaaaat ? "
Let's see what they REALLY want , bros ! !
We'll have to carry a mic with us at all times .
And I choose . . . " The Singularity " ! !
I have recently discovered a new philosophical system of beliefs !
Whom , it's worth noting , I respect !
In Super Mario Brothers , a mushroom turns you from Mario into Super Mario ! You double in size . Dudes and ladies : how is this EVEN POSSIBLE ? ?
T - Rex this is -
{ { in italics } } . . . Weird .
We need and IN - UNIVERSE EXPLANATION - and I have performed this feat ! Consider the universe of GTA : much like ours , exept for a single individual who is FUNCTIONALLY IMMORTAL . Police arrest him , he walks free . If he's shot / exploded / whatever , hospitals will restore him to perfect health no matter how bad the damage is : even if he jumps from an exploding helicopter and lands on another exploding helicopter !
Ma ma ma ma matey / Don't you forget my number ! "
The only way this boat could be better is if they'd named her the " HMS Hey Screw You Guys " . But whenever I close my eyes and imagine that all I see are the words " TOO RAD " , floating in an otherwise featureless void !
. . . Awwww .
Someone in the room says something to another person , and then they both leave . Assuming you know exactly how they moved when they left ( and therefore how they displaced the air ! ) then any remaining displacement is due to sound waves . By looking at the location of the air molecules in the empty room , you can reconstruct what was said in the past ! Dudes ! It's a perfect , UNDETECTABLE listening device !
Man , you should !
If we can solve SAT problems in f ( n ) time , then circuit - SAT can be solved in 0 ( n ) + f ( n ) time !
Certainly your beefy elbows aren't off limits ! You know , the ones that are just COATED in layers of muscles on top of muscles ?
She also brings cell phone technology , which would allow the resistance to tactically outmanoeuvre the Empire , using texting to ensure information superiority .
I don't know , T - Rex ! Why DON'T bats live alone ?
You are !
You sound like you're actually convincing yourself that this is a good idea !
They were very delicious chickens . I would eat them all again , given the chance .
I'M ANGRY BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME
Those were my private thoughts ! She had no right to tell you !
I did and I stand by it !
OH MY GOD , HOW DID I FORGET ABOUT DON KIKONG ? ?
Because when they launched them , the astronauts crashed directly into the firmament !
Batman's not real , T - Rex ! I can't believe I'm saying this .
So , how's your ankle ?
And you kinda hate everyone but don't want to talk about it ?
Sure , all you need are sychronized timers ! Send one bit to say 'start counting' and a second to say 'stop ! '
Yes , T - Rex ?
Yeah , but I'm totally the worst .
I also like people whose names are verbs , like " Pat " and " Mary , " sort of . And I really like people whose names are nouns and verbs AND adjectives , like . . . " Pine . "
I guess that's true for me too ! Also , I'd ask you if those chicken legs made you happy .
UTAHRAPTOR .
TERROR BEGINS TO PULL OFF YOUR CLOTHES .
Here's why : it implies that being your friend is somehow deserving of recompense . You insult yourself , but you also insult us , because if we were truly your friends , we wouldn't want prizes ! The fact that you are offering them implies you think we'd take them , which implies that you think our friendship is insincere !
Never played it ! !
It could well be , Utahraptor !
A private tooter !
I don't think he's a racist guy , but can you still be racist if you like an entire group of people ( instead of hating them ) for some perceived racial qualities ? Maybe ? But then again , there's nothing wrong with finding some feature particularly fetching , and maybe all the Asian women he meets just happen to have this feature . I don't know what to think !
The deal is that they're building a family and propagating the species !
HOLD ON LET ME REDUCE THAT TO 3D AND ALSO BE A LITTLE MORE GRAPHIC
T - Rex , I don't mean to be inconsiderate , but shouldn't you be in bed ? You're the only person I know who goes out of his way to ANNOUNCE his sickness to the world .
Seriously ! I do not .
While clearly extreme , can such activities truly be considered capital - A Adventure ?
Plato also said things like " I'm hungry guys , frig ! " but we're not remembering him for that right now !
Not a fan of your entire life reduced to a single number ? Then don't do it !
SERIOUSLY .
Guys ! There must be some way I can profit from this !
Come on , T - Rex !
Yeah , but it was STUPID , and it didn't take anyway . My point IS , if there's immortal people , they're learning all they can !
I'll simply make my AI play billions and billions of games of Tic Tac Toe , and in doing so it will realize the fundamental futility of war !
Also you should assume your senses accurately represent the world !
DUHHHHH
Wait , my list doesn't make sense . The responses don't follow from the question !
The Epmeror's minsters couldn't see the suit , but they pretended to so they'd seem smart , and the Emperor did the same . But when he took his new suit out in a parade , little kids shouted " The Emperor has no clothes ! ! " .
Can do , friend !
Thant's not what I'm saying ! WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT this frank talk about religion would result in heated debate ?
GUYS YOU KNOW I ONLY HAD LIKE ONE DAY RIGHT
Weird , I was thinking a restaurant where you don't have to pay if you're super handsome
NOW :
NUKE THE FRIGGIN' MOON .
TWO DAYS ? ! That's terrible ! That's entirely terrible . Listen , life is stupid and I'm going to stockpile water .
My utopian society moved , Dromiceiomimus ! They moved away !
Oh yeah ? You can do better ?
I will prove it to you , I know what will happen before it happens ! Watch : I am about to stomp a house .
Argh ! Friggin' yoga schools !
2x COMBO ! ! " Ignorance is bliss " and " no news is good news " !
Hah , I sure did describe ninja turtles as being neat ! Splinter taught them to be ninja teams ! What's not neat about that ?
She's making a huge logical leap ! It's indisputible that thinking is going on , right , but we don't know for sure that Descartes is doing the thinking ! All we know for sure is that thinking is going on .
In the second example , there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered , while in the first , this is not necessarily the case ! And this applies not just to butter : there are many other examples . For instance , " Gary wrote for many TV shows " leaves open the possibility of a co - author on the scripts , a possibility that " Gary wrote many TV shows " does not !
Some guy's parked car had its emergency brake fail , and it rolled down a hill and hit your house ! I think you need new siding .
More impressive , and still invited for Yukon Potato Gnocchi , are words that are SPELT the same , but have two different meanings : words like " attribute " ( to credit something to someone ) and " attribute " ( a property of something ) ! One's a noun and one's a verb and it's seriously so awesome . I cannot imagine how to perfect these words , as they are already perfect ! Oh ho ho !
I don't actually know what I'm saying ; I've just won Star Wars before when I've said that sentence .
I thought your " day of rage " was yesterday .
Hah ! Will he be back SHORTLY ?
Why do you have to be kind of a jerk about it , parking ticket guy ?
It sure is great that everyone everywhere has safe access to clean drinking water !
Pathetic fallacy is when nature reflects someone's emotions . It happens whenever Shakespeare gets pissed , and then the dude who he's pissed at gets eaten by a bear !
You're hoping that in alternate universes , you'll get alternate versions of Hamlet !
We need more sayings that include stealth universal laws !
SHARE IF YOU WILL NEVER STOP POOTY POOTING
Forget you , internet ! Your skeletons cost like $ 6000 !
Soon . . .
People are always SO DOWN on burning books but they forget that a dude need space for like , crops and junk !
Computers screw up all the time , yo !
Fine ! FINE . I'll be the only one revealing personal truths today . Are you ready for some factual truth bombs ? HERE THEY FRIGGIN' COME !
Okay ! So the average life expetancy is what - 81 years ? That's pretty terrific . That's a good long time - 29585 days !
AND SADNESS THAT , NOW , I MUST DESTROY THIS WORLD I ONCE LOVED .
And yet even so , a successful journey depends on the winds , and the weather , and on getting lucky with storms .
And British men are cultured and maybe a little stuffy !
Wow . . . Grandfather sure knows how to throw a party !
Ahem . One day a murderer went crazy and sliced people in half until they DIED . He killed everyone in town and then he turned to the camera and said he'd kill you , the reader ! !
Utahraptor ! It's you !
" DINOSAUR LAFFS " featuring t - rex the dinosaur
When you think about it , we've been friends for over a quarter of my life !
My favourite food is - a secret !
This certainly is a lot of talk about credit cards ! Aren't there any more pressing issues , T - Rex ?
Well , it's 11 am and I had things to do today . Maybe if you told me in advance . . . ?
Yes ! Eavesdropping teens who'll overhear our conversation and say " Holy smokes ! I'd better learn to love safety ! " and then , they go and learn to love safety .
Anyway , forget infinite time ! I have a better idea . What if this universe is just one . . . of many ?
I have been to one , and don't freak out , but it was delicious AND free .
Dude !
No time to talk ; I've got a boat to catch !
I have writen my own " Choose your own adventure " story ! It is less depressing than the other one . I can it " HOW THE UNIVERSE ENDS , a story starring YOU ! But it was written by me , T - Rex " .
OHHHHHHHHHH
What ? I've got mad skills at poker !
Baby T - REX ! !
Well , you're overlooking the fact that what consciousness does is give us a choice ! a conscious sunflower could CHOOSE not to follow the sun , and the it's behaving differently .
This seems pretty reasonable . But it can't possibly be the case ! If you take me , I've got two parents . My parents have two parents themselves , so this means that three generations ago , four people are needed to eventually produce me . Another generation back , we're eight people , and five generations ago gives me sixteen ancestors !
GREETINGS T - REX IT'S THE DEVIL GUESS WHERE I WENT DOWN TO LAST WEEK
So what IS a computer ?
I know ! I'm freaking out over here . This is me :
Oooh , juicy gossip ! Let's dish !
Oh yeah ? Well this next one represents you .
If I see someone all the time , it's more likely they'll become my sweetie !
FOREVER NOW
You know what'd be great , Chef ?
It's kinda adorable !
And so in conclusion , that's where babies come from .
They dovetail together nicely .
Oh man it's like
IT WILL BE HILARIOUS
And I am only too happy to provide them !
Look up " surprised " in the dictionary and you'll see a picture of me in this exact position ! !
ROMANCE TIPS WITH T - REX WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA
So - remix culture !
And if you ask me it's high time for some NEW CONTRACTIONS !
Suddenly Utahraptor decided to stop being mean ! !
OPTIMISM COMIS
Then you eat a flower , and you gain the ability to shoot fire out of your hands !
Eh ? Would you say you find something COMMENT - WORTHY in my speech , Dromiceiomimus ?
You'll have to wear them every day , so maybe you'll , um , want to see how they look before you commit ?
They loved nutrition so much they became REAL !
We can't know what might've been , T - Rex . It's impossible !
It doesn't count if you're just spitting on me
T - REX'S EROTICA IS EXTREMELY POPULAR !
Not only would I meet rapists and murderers KINDA OFTEN , I GUESS , but I'd also regularly see domestic violence , petty crime , people being mean to each other , chicks and dudes who punch each other in the head with knives this time , and so on . Not cool ! After seeing that day in and day out , I would start to suspect that everyone sucks and has a case of the ILLEGAL CRAZIES . I'd lose my optimism and faith in the world !
Nope ! It's just a talking filing cabinet that undermines the whole book .
HIDE AND GO SEEK
Yeah , it's hard to tell but I think you might've been wrong even as a baby .
Maybe they do , but they're just super spicy pills , so people's eyes well up when they bite into them . Anyway !
up to a house about seven or eight and you yelled to the cabbie , " Yo homes , smell you later ! " ?
I might , um , feel a little weird celebrating the birthday of a fictional character , but I'll try to be there !
But one in seven Canadians is ALSO productively employed in the agri - food industry !
My favorite are the freegans !
But you can't really invent a new emotion -
Hey ! Careful with the cusses , Captain Cussy Pants !
" Jane Austen's Fishytime Bites " , yeah , I was there .
Hah ! I don't think I love the way you do !
THE TWO BITEY GUYS DISCUSS EARLY APPROACHES TOWARDS LAISSEZ - FAIRE CAPITALISM
The battle raged long into the night .
Okay , doctor .
I know ! But then I realized there's probably a delay , so when a bunch of birds poop on my head later on this week I'm not going to wonder why .
What ? I thought they were called " pecs " because it stands for " Pretty Erotic Chest Section " ! !
Screw it ! ! I'm gonna talk to him , right now !
But it only really shows up in parallel timelines , where dogs are called " barkbarkpantpantbarkbarkwhine " s . That doesn't mean you can't use it in your stories though ! For example , try naming a main character " HellomynameisCaptainPete " if his first line in the story is " Hello , my name is Captain Pete " !
Dromiceiomimus ! You owe me ten sub sandwiches , and I'm calling in the debt .
In just the way you'd think !
I'm serious , what if it is ? ?
Similar to antisolipsism but ACTUALLY REAL is the Cotard Delusion , in which the person affected believes they have died .
. . . Still here ? You heard what I said about casual sex , right ? And yet you're not out looking for casual sex partners RIGHT NOW ? Hmm . Maybe I didn't explain it right . Okay .
T - REX IN : MARY SUE COMICS
Yeah , dollars are way too big for them to hold in their tiny hands .
Dude , I have NO IDEA .
As a kid I thought newspapers kept obits for EVERYONE , updating them throughout their lives ! They were like Santa , keeping track of use , drawing narrative threads together ! I'd just never critically evaluated that belief as an adult .
What ? By " ok " , do you mean GREAT ? And by " I guess " , do you mean " know with absolute certainty ? " If so , then I agree !
We recommend that sufficient insurance be purchased to cover all of your travel requirements .
{ { censored } } { { censored } } { { censored } } { { censored } } { { censored } } mother { { censored } } ! !
Again : totally would if I totally could !
CAN IT BE EXPLAINED BY SCIENTISTS ?
Some body parts grew huge as their cells divided wildly while others withered and died . Rachel - thankfully ! - didn't last much longer , and her last words were " If T - Rex narrativizes my life story I'll come back and haunt him forever " . Later , I -
" Strange . . . temporal . . . light . . . " he said , whispering the words as he wrote them down . When he looked up , Sherlock had already bounded out of the time machine and was lost somewhere in the year 2969 .
The thing is , if I were real , I think we both know that I'd never have the time to hang out with a NON crime - fighting dinosaur .
I buy my clothes off the rack ! !
frig , wait , hold on , i just meant to think that
Do I have time to correct my mistakes ?
Oh man ! Remember when I set up this event ?
Samantha was a cowgirl , always on the lookout for a SPUR - of - the - moment marriage . Antonio Tony was a horse enthusiast . " I hope to be SADDLED with a wife soon ! " he thought to himself . They waved wildly at each other across the open plains .
You'll miss out on seeing all the costumes of the kids who come to your house !
Happiness : The End - Game of All Intelligent Life ! ?
Dude ! Good thing I was around , eh ?
I'd only say that sometimes , Utahraptor .
Talking about it is what's made me angry !
Do I dare ASK IT ?
I don't recall saying that ! !
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY SOMETHING ELSE
Oh , that's too bad . Well , some other time !
That's part of the fiction !
Once upon a time Jay found a magic lamp with a genie inside ! " You get one wish , " the genie said . " This didn't work out so well in the other timeline , so uh , be careful ? "
That's right , bitches ! People still says " behooves' ! !
Yeah , I mean , I get what you're doing , but what's the point ?
Wait , does " bestie " mean " best friend " or is it a contraction of " best tie " ?
They should all be super geniuses too !
Man , I'd rather she expand her horizons beyond the ten NON - BACKGROUND characters in Riverdale . Her dating options there are , in their entireity : Archie , Moose , Dilton , Chuck , Reggie , and Jughead . That's it ! PROBABLY SHE CAN DO BETTER . Maybe she should chat up Background Teen In Green Shirt once in a while , you know ?
Let's say you're a dude who is having trouble with , to put it delicately , too much poo . And you think , " I'm going to take some medicine and put this issue to bed ! " Excellent idea , rhetorical dude ! !
UM OBVIOUSLY I MEANT A BETTER DEGREE FROM A MORE RESPECTABLE SCHOOL .

" It was a stupid observation to make . Plus , using 'ejaculated' to mean 'said suddenly' went out of style with corsets and growing your own pigs and four - digit years that start with '18' " .
THAT WAY YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO HORSE FACTS
