But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities, turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures (and continents and skin colours) we all believe some of the same things.

For example, I can dust a crop (adding pesticides to it), or I can dust a counter (removing dust from it)!  Way to go, dust!  You are a winner; you are a word that contains multitudes.\nDromiceiomimus: Why do we let language get like this?\nT-Rex: Probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome?",

And it's even worse with words like \"overlook\", meaning \"examine\" but ALSO meaning \"miss noticing entirely\".  Can't rely on the noun there!\nUtahraptor: How come you love words that make communication difficult?",
