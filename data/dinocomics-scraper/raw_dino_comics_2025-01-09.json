Which of us is right?\nT-Rex: That is the beauty of relativism: we both are!\n\nT-Rex: Ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever!\nUtahraptor: Oh really?!\n\nUtahraptor: It can be argued that in every rational person (the definition of 'rational' is a touchy subject I won't discuss here) there are certain properties common to all. The problem (well, one problem) with relativism is how it nihilistically privileges the experience of the individual above all else, making every ethical decision the right ethical decision: who would not like to have his or her beliefs guaranteed to be as correct as anybody else's? But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities, turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures (and continents and skin colours) we all believe some of the same things. With that striking fundamental truth removed, the baby-rapers and the saints stand side by side, equals in righteousness.\n\nT-Rex: But your first assumption is flawed! I doubt you can find even one universal constant; even your revealing example of baby-rape is practiced by some! Granted, these people are considered\" monsters\", but isn't that just a case of the majority condemning a minority?

Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars?\nT-Rex: Part of the attraction to this structure may be its possibilities: most anything can happen in a bar, especially if this bar is contained within the wild and wooly world of the verbal jest.\n\nUtahraptor: What about the joke, \"A man walks into a bar...ouch!\"?\nT-Rex: Good question!\n\nT-Rex: The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience, an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment.\nUtahraptor: Go on!\nT-Rex: The \"ouch\" is startling. How could entering a bar hurt? It forces us to now re-evaluate our most basic assumptions.\n\nT-Rex: We must ask ourselves, \"What if the bar were a bar proper, and by walking into it the man actually, physically walked into it?\"\nT-Rex: It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor!",

So why should that change when you add sex to it?

It's not anti-monogamy, but it is pro-polygamy. \nUtahraptor: But don't you find that these things don't work in real life?

The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!\nT-Rex: The \"balls\" in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane's throttle control. When the throttle was at full, the \"balls\" would be \"to the wall\" of the cockpit!\nT-Rex: And that's the origin of the phrase \"balls to the wall\".\n\nUtahraptor: You are incorrect! The phrase comes from olde-fashioned steam-powered trains!\nT-Rex: What?\n\nUtahraptor: It's true! Basically, the engines had two weighted balls, attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine. As the engine speed increased, these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force! At top speed, they would be parallel to the ground, nearly touching the \"walls\" of the shaft!\n\nT-Rex: Hence, \"balls to the wall\"! Man!\nT-Rex: That's sweet!",

The silent, gloomy, sepia-toned ones?\n\nT-Rex: They're so sad!\n\nT-Rex: What gets me every time is the faces of people I'll never meet, people long dead, trying not to move as they stare into that early camera lens... but what ESPECIALLY always gets me are the faces of the people who did move.  This was for some the only time their face would be recorded, and they happened to shift.\nT-Rex: That's so sad!  That's profoundly sad!\n\nUtahraptor: Is it because those blurred faces remind you that no matter what, the past can never be completely known?\n\nT-Rex: Kind of!  But I think what affects me the most if the idea of someone coming that close to achieving at least a type of immortality, and then losing it to something as natural and ordinary as glancing away.\nUtahraptor: Early photography does have its own sense of sad nostalgia, doesn't it?\n\nT-Rex: It does indeed!  It makes me want to go home and sit, alone and sober, in a darkened room.\nT-Rex: Whoooo!",

Some places allow 12-year-olds to consent to sex, while others believe that even people in their early twenties are unable to give knowledgeable consent to the INTERCOURSE.\n\nUtahraptor: This is a pretty dangerous topic, isn't it?\nT-Rex: Dangerous how?\n\nUtahraptor: Well, isn't this one of those topics that you'd talk about with friends in private, but not while out in a public place?  You don't want people to think you're a PEDOPHILE.\nT-Rex: What? I haven't mentioned anything that would make people say that!

When they burned, the phlogiston was released into the air!\n\nUtahraptor:  That's a pretty crazy theory!\nT-Rex:  Yeah, but it totally worked for a while!\n\nT-Rex:  It explained why if you burned things in a jar, they would go out:  the air can only hold so much phlogiston!

It's SO GOOD.\n\nT-Rex: My favourite are the extended takes, where you ask your subject a question, they answer it, and then you hold the camera on them for a good ten seconds afterwards while they glance around and look ridiculous.\nUtahraptor: It is a great way to subtly undermine your subject without saying a word.\n\nT-Rex: Yep.

Evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations, but rather intentional.\n\nT-Rex: Much as a watch implies a watchmaker, so does our universe imply divinity!\n\nT-Rex: Okay!  It's a very nice idea, but it's not science because it's not disprovable: you either believe in intelligent design or you don't, and there's no way to show who's right.  That's not science - that's faith!\nDromiceiomimus: And whould faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method?\nT-Rex: Of course not!\n\nUtahraptor: The issue is that some think ID should be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution, right?\nT-Rex: Right!\n\nT-Rex: But there's nothing in ID (as I've formulated it) to say that the two can't exist peacefully.  One just doesn't belong in science class, because it's not a science.  It belongs in religion class.\nUtahraptor: Wait - T-Rex, you claim to hear the voice of God!

It is especially hard with your first language, when you're a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you.\n\nT-Rex: It's not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!\n\nT-Rex: It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us, but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close.  So the result is we (as learners) end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with, wut which is slightly different than those that surround us!\n\nUtahraptor: How slight a difference are we talking about here?\nT-Rex: That depends on the learner, I guess!\n\nT-Rex: Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed, because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you.

That is me! I talk as if nobody's listening, I dance as if nobody's watching, and I eat as if nobody's hungry.\nOff-panel: That last one is a BIT less attractive.\nT-Rex: I also vacuum as if nobody's going to get their carpets any cleaner!\nT-Rex: Daaaamn!",

Are you still punching children?\"\nDromiceiomimus: What? No!!\nT-Rex: Aha - so when did you stop? See what I did there? The question presupposes that you've been punching on children in the past, and goes on to suggest that maybe you're still doing so.  It is LOADED like rich uncle Pennybags.  From Monopoly?\n\nUtahraptor: Your question is really two questions combined into one!\nT-Rex: Yep!\n\nT-Rex: It breaks down to \"Have you ever punched children, and, if so, are you still doing so?\" But since these are merged, and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer, \"no\" becomes misleading.  The solution is not to answer \"yes\" or \"no\", but to reject the question!\nUtahraptor: Really!\n\nUtahraptor: T-Rex, are you still punchin' children? Are you still punching them just to steal their ice cream cones?\nT-Rex: I reject your question, Utahraptor!

Getting a woman to like you is easy!\n\nT-Rex: There are plenty of websites, magazine articles and body spray ads that will reassure you that women are just conquests without agency and that they won't have sex with you unless you suggest it to them first. My advice is DIFFERENT. My advice is rooted in reality and allows for women actually wanting the intercourse sometimes!\n\nUtahraptor: Okay, so let's hear it!\nT-Rex: The advice?\n\nUtahraptor: Yeah. Let's hear this modern, sexually enlightened advice that applies to both lesbians AND dudes.\nT-Rex: WELL, for that you'll have to buy my book, \"Dudes! Lesbians! Guess What? Here is How to Get Women to Like You\". But since we're friends, I'll give you a sneak peek!\n\nT-Rex: CHAPTER 3: At The Bar.There are sometimes lots of women at the bar. If you want to talk to one, then maybe she will want to talk to you! Then you can become her favourite dude or lesbian.\"\nOff-panel: That's not very helpf-\nT-Tex: \"Intercourse ensues!\"",

This determination is NOT done by fate or God or whatever, but rather by an almost endless chain of prior events.

You still pay taxes - say, a flat tax of 10% - BUT, the government also pays you enough to survive! This way there's a guaranteed minimum income - like welfare, but simpler. So if you make only $1000 in a year you'll pay $100 in taxes, but since the government pays everyone, say, $10000, you'll end up $9900 ahead in tax money.

To-day I am going to invente scientifical fictionne!\"?\nT-Rex: I want to listen to Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, K. 331, and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it. Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes?\n\nUtahraptor: You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.\nT-Rex: But you get the idea!\n\nUtahraptor: But T-Rex, there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it's not that big a step from rap. I'm sure there where people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons.\n\nNarrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:\nT-Rex: Alright, this is blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, an uh, try to keep up.\nT-Rex: \"I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie to the hip hip hop, and you don't stop!\"\nT-Rex: Mozart!

A bystander told his wife it was the best chase ever and she knew it was true.  They were chasing on foot again when it ended.  Utahraptor arrested T-Rex, but T-Rex explained how the bank was evil.  The cop thought now I am torn between the law and what I believe is right.  What do I do now!  Utahraptor let T-Rex go with a warning.  T-Rex said thanks I have learned my lesson.  The mystery was solved, except for one part: where would the spirit of adventure take T-Rex next??\n\nT-Rex: So?  What do you think, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon?\nMichael Chabon: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!\nT-Rex: I don't think you should use the word \"retarded\" like that, Michael Chabon.",

Can't verify faith!\n\nT-Rex:  In fact, that's it for a lot of debate, because how can you argue FACTS?  Most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands.\nDromiceiomimus:  But if they can't verify something, what do they do?\nT-Rex:  They agree that the sentence is meaningless!

Science is about being empirically ACCURATE, which might not be the same thing as being true.  Plus your senses could be lying to you, you could be a brain in a jar, etc..

He always seems excited.\n\nNarrator: I asked him why, and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company, and wanted T-Rex to call because he's better at these sorts of things. They'd failed to deliver her package four times now. T-Rex already has \"suckified delivery companies\" on his revenge list (he'd said), so he was pleased to call. He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse, got a full head of steam, and called them up. Long story short, the package had actually been delivered that morning. T-Rex claims victory.\n\nNarrator: I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.\n\nNarrator: My contrarian position (I freely admit it) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone: with companies this size, there's no way she was responsible for the package. Responsibility is so diffused that really, nobody is responsible - it's a system failure, and the person in the call centre can't change the system. He replied that as his only contact point, agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he's not going to make allowances for someone else's broken system. We agreed to differ.\n\nNarrator: I realize that this is my diary for the new year, and all I've written about so far is T-Rex. the responsibility for this, I feel, lies solely in this Christmas gift \"stationary\" from T-Rex himself. He's drawn himself in every panel, and the same pre-printed title takes up all the space in the first one.

We don't know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age, how Spider-Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks. I mean, we DO, because sometimes out-of-continuity stories explore this, but they're never for real - they don't count! Bats is always 30 again in the next story.

    "text": "T-Rex: So, SOMETIMES, archeologists find things that don't belong in their geological contexts: shells where there were no oceans, that sort of thing. And there's lots of explanations like \"maybe an animal ate it and pooped it out, GROSS.\"\n\nT-Rex: But sometimes these objects are found with human remains!\n\nT-Rex: And when that happens they call it a manuport: something that was carried by hand by ancient dead dudes. Manuports are neat because they show you what ancient dead dudes found interesting! And the most awesome manuport is the oldest one, called the Makapansgat pebble. It dates to 3 million years ago!\n\nUtahraptor: There weren't humans around to carry it 3 million years ago, T-Rex!\nT-Rex: Nope!\n\nT-Rex: But there were PROTOHUMANS. Australopithecines! And the Makapansgat pebble has this natural \"eye eye mouth\" face shape on it. A protohuman had enough curiosity and aesthetic sense, 3 MILLION YEARS AGO, to see the face in the rock, and thought it was special enough to carry around with him until he died.\n\nT-Rex: I think it's beautiful and amazing that millions of years later, another human being dug up the same pebble, recognized the same face, and maybe even for a moment, dreamed the same dreams.\nUtahraptor: You stepped on a human being back there.\nT-Rex: That's - um, that's beautiful too?",

And so Midas wishes that everything he touched would turn to gold.\n\nT-Rex: Instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold!\n\nT-Rex: The gold change races across the planet's surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave, transmuting it instantly. In seconds, the Earth's iron-nickel core becomes pure non-ferrous gold, and the planet's magnetic field is lost. Unshielded from solar wind, every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation. The soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it, and begins to buckle and distort.\n\nT-Rex: Midas watches in horror as his planet dies a golden death!\nUtahraptor: But not for long!\n\nUtahraptor: He's soon overcome by the terrible sensation of drowning on dry land: any air that touches his lungs is being transmuted on contact into tiny flecks of gold. He suffocates and dies as his lungs fill with the formerly precious metal.\n\nUtahraptor: Air that touches his cooling body continues to transmute, and he's soon covered in a fine golden layer of ash.\nT-Rex: The moral is not to make wishes like that, King Midas!!",

This opens up whole new avenues in the field of toughening up the very scareable: just open up their brain and remove their amygdala, and it's an instant fearectomy!

Of course I know what a calorie is!\nT-Rex: It's a measurement of h- how fat you'll get?\n\nUtahraptor: It's a measurement of food energy, T-Rex!\nT-Rex: Excellent! Um, how much energy?\n\nUtahraptor: The amount needed to heat one kilogram of water by one degree Celcius.

If a new ambulance costs $100,000 but would likely save at least 100 lives while it was in use, and we decide NOT to buy it, then we're saying those particular lives aren't worth $1000. Ouch! Sorry, ambulance dudes!\n\nUtahraptor: But maybe we don't have the money to buy an ambulance anyway!\nT-Rex: Sure! It's not a perfect measurement.\n\nT-Rex: All I'm saying is we ESTIMATE it all the time. Heck, you do it whenever you're paid hourly and you speed into work! Divide the extra money you get by being there sooner by the increase chance of death the added speed brings you, and you've just VALUED YOUR OWN LIFE.\nUtahraptor: ...I - I guess so!\n\nT-Rex: On the flip side, whenever housecleaners clean a bathroom, they're PAID to kill the bacteria there!

It sounds rad to me!\n\nUtahraptor: What if you never actually go back in time though?\nT-Rex: No worries!\n\nT-Rex: On my deathbed I'll say \"Aw man, I always thought I'd go back in time and mess with history\", and then hopefully I'll disappear in a flash of temporal light because, actually, I've just gone back in time to mess with history.\nUtahraptor: ...I see. So if I said that nobody knows who the historical King Arthur was? \n\nT-Rex: I'd say, \"That's me!\" His exploits shall be going to have been being done by me! \nUtahraptor: Future perfect continuous passive?\nT-Rex: Ahem.

Be sure to show many human interests, such as in whether or not other humans like you, in images and stories of what other humans are doing or have done, and SOMETIMES, in getting naked and mixing genetic traits through gamete combination.\nT-Rex: HOT.\n\nUtahraptor: Also, be sure not to blow your cover!\nT-Rex: Yes!\n\nT-Rex: You'd risk undoing combined efforts sustained over 14 zetacycles. In an emergency, fake your own death and make it look like you died of something plausible, like \"old age,\" or \"suffocation.\"\nUtahraptor: Yes.

So I can say \"[Exclusive] We are going to a party!

In Round One everyone gets to decide how many of their cards they want to drop, but it turns out no matter what number you say, you get the same amount of cards back to replace them.  Ha ha!  This game was designed by a madman.

In this sense, EVERYONE'S a winner, as it will become clear in the first 30 minutes that you've lost, yet the game will grind on for hours after that. It is during this time that you will explore these emotions.

For example, you may want to say with \"WHAT CAPRICIOUS GOD WOULD CRAFT THIS TERRIBLE FATE\", but you won't have enough letters for that. So you'll fall back to \"HELLO\", but oops, no \"E\", so instead you open the conversation with \"ABS\".

Eventually I asked a question, I forget what, but it somehow CLEARLY REVEALED that I had not in fact seen the episode at all.

But it's also super constrained and sad, for the world is hollow and walls surround you perfectly.

Being last to be chosen was just the beginning: you knew you had an hour ahead of you playing a game where you didn't know the rules but everyone else did, an hour of not being sure who was on your team and who wasn't, an hour where the only relief was when you somehow threw the ball away in the right direction after it came to you.\n\nUtahraptor: This is all about rugby?\nT-Rex: What about it?!

Put simply: elements of alternate timelines can be merged into our own.\nT-Rex: If you choose 100 randomly-selected houses to deliver presents to -\n\nUtahraptor: - then there's an alternate reality where 100 different houses were chosen!\nT-Rex: Precisely.

But we were able to use the Sled. And now, he was successful.\n\nT-Rex: But overwriting the trillions of timelines in which we failed with our only victory led to some side-effects, including 175,250,000 alternative \"Rudolph\" corpses that materialized in a fused-together mound near the North Pole.\nT-Rex: Cleanup duty begins at 0800.

It was easy; I just used logic!\nDromiceiomimus: I think the idea is that zombies are undead?\nT-Rex: Come on, what's \"undead\" mean? \"Not dead\". That's ALIVE, dude. You kill zombies by shooting 'em in the head, and if it can be killed, it wasn't dead, therefore: alive.\n\nUtahraptor: Maybe they're a new form of life - a new species - and they have a leftover aversion to cannibalism?\nT-Rex: PLEASE.\n\nT-Rex: \"Zombie life\" looks exactly like regular life, only with some blood on its clothes. THEREFORE successful aversion to cannibalism would require each zombie conceptualize a mind-self/body-self dichotomy, something ALREADY hard enough when you're not consumed by endless hunger and a bottomless desire to eat meat!\n\nT-Rex: BELIEVE ME",

After a few weeks she had a few data points. ONE: the goose was not eating any gold. so it must be produced internally. TWO: Gold produced / (food consumed + body mass lost) = 5% = a transmutation efficiency equation. And THREE: other geese feeding in the same area would not produce golden eggs. So she concluded, quite rightly, that the phenomenon was related to the goose itself!\n\nUtahraptor: And she couldn't breed it, because all its eggs were solid gold. \nT-Rex: Exactly.\n\nT-Rex: The only way left to learn more was dissection! So for science, she gave up a source of great personal riches.

Composer Marshall Island has just finished a song that will one day be known as \"The Ultimate Song 2000\". \n\nT-Rex: This name is super dated though so eventually it's shortened to \"The Ultimate Song\"!\n\nT-Rex: The Ultimate Song is, objectively, the best song. We all thought it was impossible - that music was too varied, tastes too wide - for one song to be universally the best, but whether by chance or by design, it now exists. All other songs suffer in comparison. There is a brief artistic movement obsessed with flaws, imperfections, but that only gets us so far. We keep coming back to the song: it's perfect. Why would we listen to anything else?\n\nUtahraptor: Don't  songs eventually get old?\nT-Rex: Imperfect songs do, yeah! Perfect ones, not so much.\n\nT-Rex:Everyone tries to learn from the perfect song, reverse-engineer it: Can we use it to produce the perfect painting? Poem? The perfect justice system? But we fail. It seems Earth is to touch perfection but once, and this is it: one single song.\nUtahraptor: Wow. I mean what do songs DO?\n\nT-Rex: That's what consumes us. We encode the song into the golden records of the Voyager Spacecraft, racing them towards distant stars. It's not because we want to share: it's a planet's last. desperate cry for help.\nT-Rex: It's a death spasm that infects the galaxy.",

Chris could now remember two childhoods, two histories, two sets of feelings for their mutual friends, could revisit conversations from both sides. And whenever something new hapened to Nat, Chris got it too.\nT-Rex: From now on, Chris would always know more than Nat.\n\nUtahraptor: They're joined as two souls never have before!\nT-Rex: No minds had ever been so close!\n\nT-Rex: Nat was upset when told what was going on, but they reconciled quickly since Chris felt Nat's hurt just as deeply as Nat did. \"Love\" didn't describe their relationship. It was more like - shared personhood. A new state of being.\nUtahraptor: ...Wow. That's really intense.\n\nT-Rex: Later, they having some mind-blowing sex AND/OR grow up into cool spies where Nat sneaks in to read documents while Chris transcribes them in safety!\nT-Rex: Like most authors, at the start of a new story I haven't quite decided if I'm writing erotica yet, you know?",

But in a POSITIVE way. He'd be big into it.\nUtahraptor: \"Look how prehensile it is,\" he'd say.\n\nT-Rex: Using my prehensile powers I can shape my tongue thusly, turning it into a tiny waterslide for this lump of food left over from some larger food I ate earlier!!!\nUtahraptor [off-panel]: Like that: precisely.\nUtahraptor [off-panel]: ...Okay, I guess you're really him NEVERMIND",

It was a single eponymous pea!!\n\nT-Rex: The next day, the princess claimed to have ACTUAL, PHYSICAL BRUISING from a tiny lump in her FREE BED TOWER. Obviously she was a garbage person. Due to sexisms the princes believed that her insane wimpiness was proof of true princesshood. So they were married. They deserved each other, and nobody should learn from their example.\n\nT-Rex: Year later, his mother was found buried under a collapsed pile of mattresses.\nT-Rex: The end!",

Those to avoid include \"winged\", \"like a tub, from a bathroom, but big, and extremely specialized\" and \"if you can imagine a toy boat, but larger, or maybe if you imagined a toy boat with toy people on it first, and then make THAT larger\". \n\nNarrator: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU NOW HAVE NO EXCUSES NOT TO HAVE BOATS IN EVERY STORY YOU WRITE\nFrom outside of panel: Writing's hard, huh?\nT-Rex: Um, not anymore!!",

And do we? HECK YES WE DO. One Thomas Midgley, Jr. The man synthesized Freon, aka the first CFC. Remember them? The chemicals responsible for DEPLETING THE FRIGGIN' OZONE??\n\nUtahraptor: But SOMEONE had to invent CFCs, right?\nT-Rex: If that's where he stopped, I'd agree with you!\n\nT-Rex: But Thomas also invented LEADED GASOLINE. The dude dumped NEUROTOXINS into GASOLINE, and ignored it when his staff became plagued with INSANITY. From LEAD-POISONING. You know, before they DIED. Yeah, that DEFINITELY doesn't sound like the work of a hateful intelligence that despises ALL LIFE BUT ITSELF.\n\nT-Rex: Thomas died only adfter ACCIDENTALLY STRANGLING HIMSELF in a system of pullies he invented. An accident? Or the last act of his original mind, desperate to end his reign of destruction?? In conclusion, the oceans are terrifying and will swallow us all, the end.",

It's like, what do we really know about dogs??\n\nT-Rex: They'd need to smell light, which seems CRAZY. But not impossible?

    "text": "T-Rex: Gluten are airborne tropical spores.  They colonize foods left uncovered, and first infested North American food processing plants 15 years ago when they started running 24/7.  They're very expensive to remove, which is why \"gluten free\" costs more.\n\nNarrator: WHAT IS... A GLUTEN?\n\nDromiceiomimus: That's cute, but \"glutens\" are really the industry term for the trace amount of feces legally permitted in ground or processed meats.  The animals are processed whole, which means their intestines - usually with animal waste still inside them - get added to the mix.  Interestingly, gluten-free foods aren't ACTUALLY gluten free: they've just been chemically treated to sterilize the fecal output.\n\nUtahraptor: Actually, gluten is the name for the nutritional slurry used as a starter in industrial yeast cultures!\nT-Rex: Neat!\n\nT-Rex: But in reality, \"gluten\" was one of the first GMO genes ever privatized.  UN subsidies helped it to displace most organic wheat crops worldwide, so once people started developing allergies, it was far too late.  Gluten-free foods are made from the few remaining \"heritage\" of non-GMO, strains.\n\nOff-screen: But for real: gluten is a naturally-occurring wheat protein and unless you have celiac disease or gluten allergies, there are no published experimental studies showing and health benefits from a gluten-free diet.\nT-Rex: Uh, BOOORRRIINNNGG",

Whatever power that was animating the mummy was clearly in the ancient funeral dressing.

Let's find out together, as we voyage to...\n\nT-Rex:  THE WORLD OF TOMORROW!!\n\nNarrator:  50 YEARS IN THE FUTURE:\nDromiceiomimus:  Not much has changed, T-Rex!  Because as you know, we are dinosaurs, and dinosaurs DO NOT USE TECHNOLOGY!!\nT-Rex:  *gasp*\n\nNarrator:  1000 YEARS IN THE FUTURE:\nUtahraptor:  A millennium passing is, to us, as unremarkable as the passing of a single day!\nT-Rex:  *gasp*\n\nNarrator:  1 MILLION YEARS IN THE FUTURE:\nUtahraptor:  Without invention, technology, or even an oral history to inform us of our past, even a million years can leave no mark on our eternal present, forever unchanging and forever unchanged!!\nT-Rex:  Well dang, THIS was a complete waste of time!\n\nNarrator:  BACK IN THE PRESENT:\nT-Rex:  So as you can see, our descendants will spend the next million years hanging out, and nothing will ever get noticeably worse.\nT-Rex:  NOT BAD, NOT BAD.",

    "text": "T-Rex: At the top of our list are plasmas! OBVIOUSLY. Plasmas are ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE GAS, and that is extremely awesome. Lightning is plasma and lightning RULES, therefore plasma easily takes our coveted #1 spot.\n\nNarrator: THE CLASSICAL STATES OF MATTER\nNarrator: as arranged from best to worst\n\nT-Rex: In #2 we have solids! Solids are so super great that we actually use them as a synonym for \"super great\". \"He's a solid dude\", we say. Solids combine the thrill of a liquid's tangibility with the frisson of a consistent shape that even plasmas can't offer. We love solids and solids love us, hence their... SOLID second-place finishing??\n\nUtahraptor: Liquids at #3?\nT-Rex: Liquids at #3.\n\nT-Rex: While not as good as solids, without liquids we'd lose blood, which means, scientifically, our bodies would be filled with some sort of blood-like gas - in which case minor cuts would send us flying around the room like a balloon - or a \"blood plasma\", which I think is already a thing.\n\nT-Rex: Gas is left in last place, of which the less said the better. Easily misplaced and often annoyingly invisible, at its core, a gas is just a liquid someone failed to properly pressurize. T-Rex: This list is objectively correct and, as such, no arguments to the contrary will be entertained.",

BETTER states of matter to spend your time as?\n\nNarrator:  THE BEST NON-CLASSICAL STATES OF MATTER\n\nT-Rex:  At the bottom of our list are Dropletons, which are quasiparticles of electrons and holes.  We all love electrons, but some of us have had bad experiences with holes.  Sorry, Dropletons.  Also, you sound like nerds.\nDromiceiomimus:  Next is degenerate matter, which sounds like it's really horny!  But instead it's found within neutron stars, scientifically incapable of sex.\nT-Rex:  BORING\n\nUtahraptor:  Let's skip to the greatest ones!\nT-Rex:  Not a problem!\n\nT-Rex:  #2 are superfluids:  liquids that can flow without friction.  Put a superfluid in a glass and it'll try to CLIMB OUT ON ITS OWN.\nUtahraptor:  Clearly excellent.\nT-Rex:  Yes.  But our #1 winner must be PHOTONIC MOLECULES:  light that behaves like it's got FRIGGIN' MASS.\n\nT-Rex:  They're what lightsabers or Green Lantern \"hard light\" constructs will be made out of, if we ever get around to inventing them.  THE END.\nT-Rex:  Again:  as this list is 100% accurate, no debate will be tolerated.",

But you've probably ALSO forgotten the most common thing all new parents forget: this kid is gonna need a name!\n\nNarrator: HOW TO NAME THE CHILD THAT CAME OUT OF YOU (OR A LOVED ONE)\n\nT-Rex: A common approach is to name the child after what you hope it will do in life. This accounts for names like \"Jack\", \"Sue\", \"Carol\", and \"Wade\".\nDromiceiomimus: Others believe you should name the child after whatever colour blood is, hence names like \"Ruby\", \"Rusty\", and \"Scarlet\".\n\nUtahraptor: Let me guess: you disagree?\nT-Rex: In fact, I do!\n\nT-Rex: There's SO MANY children named after blood already. It's weird. I recommend naming the kid after the most bad-ass animal you can think of: \"Wolf\", \"Raven\", \"T-Rex\", and \"Phoenix\" are all solid options.\nUtahraptor: Also \"Kitty\" and \"Newt\".\nT-Rex: *sigh*\n\nT-Rex: If all else fails, many simply name their child after whatever they were conceived on top of. People named \"Clay\", \"Ivy\", and \"Cash\": BEHOLD YOUR ORIGINS. The end.\nT-Rex: Oh! And also people named \"Mattress\". Duh.\n\n{{title text: a woman at the dog park had a doberman named \"Dobe\" which I thought was really lazy until I remembered all the humans I know named \"Hugh\"}}",
