Utilities to find solutions to `Dinosaur Comics 1663 <http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1663>`_.

Ryan North has given several constraints in the news post accompanying `Comic 1665 <http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1665>`_:

- All words in the solution are dictionary words.
- What's more, all words in the solution are in the Jadrian's awesome `Qwantz Corpus <http://cs.brown.edu/~jadrian/docs/etc/qwantzcorpus>`_!
- The solution is natural-sounding, reasonably-grammatical dialogue that T-Rex would say, using phrasing that T-Rex would use.
- The punctuation :,!! is in the solution, in that order!
- The longest word in the solution is 11 characters long.
- The solution does not refer to anagrams or puzzles or winning t-shirts.
- However, what T-Rex is saying is directly related to the content of the comic the puzzle appears in.
- The letters given are case-sensitive!
- The first word of the solution is "I".
- I tested out `Joel's puzzle-solving tool <http://afifthofnothing.com/anacryptogram.html>`_ and it does let you know that the correct answer works!
- The solution is long enough to make pure brute force not really feasible. You'll have to use your head.

Additionally at TCAF in 2011 Ryan said to me personally that the solution would make a good epitaph.
