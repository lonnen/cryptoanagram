Utilities to find solutions to `Dinosaur Comics 1663 <http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1663>`_.

Ryan North has given several constraints in the news post accompanying `Comic 1665 <http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1665>`_:

- All words in the solution are dictionary words.
- What's more, all words in the solution are in the Jadrian's awesome `Qwantz Corpus <http://cs.brown.edu/~jadrian/docs/etc/qwantzcorpus>`_!
- The solution is natural-sounding, reasonably-grammatical dialogue that T-Rex would say, using phrasing that T-Rex would use.
- The punctuation :,!! is in the solution, in that order!
- The longest word in the solution is 11 characters long.
- The solution does not refer to anagrams or puzzles or winning t-shirts.
- However, what T-Rex is saying is directly related to the content of the comic the puzzle appears in.
- The letters given are case-sensitive!
- The first word of the solution is "I".
- I tested out `Joel's puzzle-solving tool <http://afifthofnothing.com/anacryptogram.html>`_ and it does let you know that the correct answer works!
- The solution is long enough to make pure brute force not really feasible. You'll have to use your head.

Ryan North followed up with additional clues accompanying `Comic 1666 <http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1666>`_:

- Paul Stansifer has released `Qwantzle Data <http://github.com/paulstansifer/qwantzle_data>`_, which scraped `the OhNoRobot search engine <http://www.ohnorobot.com/index.pl?comic=23>`_ to gather Dinosaur Comics text
- Ryan `released the Dinosaur Comics text as XML <http://www.qwantz.com/everywordindinosaurcomicsOHGOD.xml>`_ which is redundant with Paul's work (above)
- The longest word is 11 characters long, the second longest is 8 characters long, and they're side-by-side in the solution

Additionally at TCAF in 2011 Ryan said to me personally that the solution would make a good epitaph.
